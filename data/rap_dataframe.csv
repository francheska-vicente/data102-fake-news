Best-selling Japanese author Haruki Murakami is will be releasing a new novel – his first in six years – on April 13, 2023. Publisher Shinchosa made the announcement on Wednesday, February 1. Although the title and plot have not been released yet, Shinchosa said that the book will be initially published in Japanese, with translations following later on. There is still no specific date on when the translated versions will be released. The novel will be “1,200 Japanese manuscript pages long,” Shinchosa said, and will cost 2,970 yen. An order link to the physical and e-book copy is already up on the website. This will be Murakami’s latest novel since the release of Killing Commendatore in 2017. Award-winning writer Murakami, 74, is best known domestically and internationally for his magical realist short stories and novels, such as Norwegian Wood (1987), Kafka on the Shore (2002), 1Q84 (2009), and Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1994), among many others. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/new-findings-kian-delos-santos-body-autopsy-2023/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The results of the latest examination on Kian delos Santos‘ remains cast doubts on the previous post-mortem examinations done by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Public Attorneys Office (PAO), according to forensic pathologist Dr. Raquel Fortun. During a press conference on Wednesday, February 2, Fortun noted at least two new findings after reexamining Delos Santos’ remains. Delos Santos was the 17-year-old boy from Caloocan City who was killed in 2017 by cops at the height of the bloody drug war of the Duterte administration. Fortun revealed that the PNP, during the first autopsy, only made a superficial cut in the body. This means Delos Santos’ body was not properly examined because the police only made an external examination, the expert added. “May hiwa ka eh na hindi mo tinuloy, so bola-bola lang ang hiwa mo (You already made a small cut in the body but you did not push through, so it seems like you’re just fooling around),” she said. “Kunwari autopsy, hiniwa…That’s it. Ang babaw ng standards natin kaya wala tayong naso-solve (Not really an autopsy, the body was only cut…That’s it. We have very low standards, that’s why we hardly solve cases).” Fortun doesn’t believe a post-mortem examination was done at all. PAO did another autopsy at Delos Santos’ residence which affirmed that the body only had a superficial cut. Fortun said this is not the first time they observed an improper post-mortem examination. “Tawag ko ‘autop-silip,’ kasi nga sinilip lang (I call it ‘autop-silip,’ because they only peeked). And these are the instances where they make an incision, they open the ribs, but then the internal organs are still there,” Fortun told reporters in a chance interview. Five years after his death, Delos Santos’ remains were exhumed by his family through the help of Project Arise led by activist-priest Father Flavie Villanueva. The reexamination was done after the exhumation. In her findings, Fortun also revealed that she recovered another bullet from Kian’s body. Based on an X-ray, the forensic expert was able to identify the location and retrieve the bullet around Kian’s neck. The bullet entered through Delos Santos’ back when he was shot by the cops. The PAO, in its examination, noted that the teen sustained two gunshot wounds in the ears and another one in the back. However, Fortun said the PAO did not investigate further so it was not able to retrieve the bullet. Randy delos Santos, Delos Santos’ uncle, was also present during the press conference. Aside from recalling the night his nephew was killed by cops, he also hit the government’s claim that the country’s justice system is working. “May sistema pala, bakit hindi nagawa? (If there is a system, why was it not applied?),” Randy said. Following the latest move of the International Criminal Court to continue the probe into drug war killings under former president Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine government still insists that the justice system is working – the same statement made by Duterte. Even in high-profile drug war cases, justice has been elusive for the victims. Since 2016, there have been only two significant convictions in the drug war cases: one for Delos Santos, where cops were convicted of murder in 2018, and another for Carl Angelo Arnaiz and Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, where cops were only convicted in 2022 of torture and planting of evidence. Aside from Delos Santos, Fortun examined at least 73 other drug war victims whose remains were exhumed. Of the victims examined through the help of Project Arise, a majority or 27 of the cases were from Caloocan City. Delos Santos was killed in the same city. Fortun also shared the following findings: The forensic expert added that she discovered 11 cases of mis-certification. This means the drug war victims were said to have died of natural causes – based on their death certificate – but actually died because of homicide. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/tom-brady-broadcasting-future-presents-new-challenge-ultimate-champion/,[],"Tom Brady was the ultimate winner on the field but that success does not guarantee the seven-time Super Bowl champion will make a seamless transition when he steps into the TV booth to begin his new role as a lead NFL analyst. The 45-year-old Brady, who retired from the National Football League earlier on Wednesday, February 1, after an illustrious 23-year career, agreed last May to join Fox Sports when his age-defying career as a quarterback came to an end. Brady, whose intense preparation for games has been well-chronicled, has an unmatched knowledge of the sport. If he can translate what he sees on the field as quickly as he processed plays as a quarterback, he could prove to be one of the best analysts around. But making the switch from the field to the TV booth is not always easy, and being relaxed, laughing at himself and not clamoring for attention could take time. “It’s going to be a challenge. Tom is a pretty serious guy, at least in terms of his public persona,” Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now runs his own sports television consulting company, told Reuters. “He’s going to be getting a tremendous amount of money from Fox and I think he’s going to feel the pressure of entertaining people, and up to now Tom’s method of entertaining people was to play quarterback, show how good he is.” The terms of Brady’s deal with Fox Sports were never disclosed but media reports said the former quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots agreed to a 10-year contract worth $375 million. Fox will be broadcasting the February 12 Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs but the network did not immediately reply when asked by Reuters whether Brady would be part of the lineup. Pilson suggests it would be better for Brady if his analyst debut did not come at the Super Bowl as that would expose him right away during the most-watched NFL game of the year. There have been no shortage of players who went on to become football analysts after their NFL careers, including Hall of Fame members Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Shannon Sharpe. Rob Ninkovich, who won two Super Bowl titles with Brady in New England and now works as an NFL analyst for ESPN, told Reuters a job talking football on television can help ease some of the hardest parts of retirement. “Michael Jordan could go play a pickup game of three on three somewhere and still, you know, still shoot a basket and get his feel of playing basketball,” said Ninkovich. “Football players, unfortunately, you hang it up and you’ll never ever put on a helmet, shoulder pads. “It’s trying to fill that void with other activities, maybe a business or, you know, entrepreneurship or even television, still talking about football and being involved in football – but you’re not taking the beating.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/years-studying-happiness-what-makes-happier-life/,[],"It’s one thing to know what makes people happy, but quite another to live a happy life oneself. I didn’t get a true taste of happiness until I quit my decade-long career as a happiness academic, packed all I’d need for many months onto a bicycle, and began meandering my way around the world to Bhutan. For those unfamiliar with Bhutan, it’s a small Himalayan kingdom, famed for basing all its national policy decisions on happiness. Quite the destination, quite the journey. And I would learn more about happiness than I did as an academic. That’s not to dismiss knowledge acquired through books and letters. Yet there’s a lot to be said for actually getting direct experience in life. Below are some of the important things I learned on a journey for happiness. When people talk about happiness, some dismiss it as a viable societal goal because happiness policy can be misconstrued as being about people smiling and laughing all the time. Yet pleasant as smiling and laughing are, doing them all the time is neither realistic nor desirable. Difficult emotions are a natural part of life. These days I love a cry – it’s an important release. And anxiety, which I’m prone to, is something I’ll be open and curious about rather than hide from. The kind of happiness I value is deeper – grounded in connection, purpose, and hope, yet has room for sadness and anxiety too. Indeed, it’s this kind of happiness that a country like Bhutan aspires to, and I think more countries (and people) should, too. Goals can be helpful. They give direction in our day-to-day lives. But it’s easy to get wrapped up in attaining an outcome, believing our happiness depends on it. Rather than being in what psychologists call flow – an immersive, in-the-moment state of being – we might doggedly push on towards a goal. Even though achieving our goals won’t always bring us happiness. When I was cycling to Bhutan, I let go of the idea of ever reaching Bhutan many times, and through doing so I ensured my journey remained purposeful and enjoyable. And, when I did arrive, beautiful as Bhutan was, exhaustion and homesickness dominated. If we’re not happy along the way, then we ought to question whether it’s worth going at all. There are many stories about what a happy life entails, but they’re not always backed up by reliable evidence. An example would be the “when I achieve this, I will be happy” story described above. Another popular story is that money buys happiness. I spent much of my research career examining this (and traveling humbly for 18 months). What is clear is that having more money (beyond the point of meeting basic needs) is inconsequential when compared with having good quality relationships, looking after our mental and physical health, and living meaningfully in line with our beliefs and values. Yet, sadly, these things often get sacrificed in pursuit of more. These stories persist because they support an economic system that is designed to increase GDP rather than improve the well-being of people and the planet. Warm and loving relationships are essential for living a happy life. Yet that doesn’t mean these are easy to come by. As an academic, I saw how important relationships were for happiness in the data. But like many, I had a difficult time realizing them in my own life. We’re not taught that way and often think people will only love us when we meet certain criteria, rather than unconditionally for who we are. What shocked me most on my cycle journey was people’s kindness and generosity. People would invite me into their lives, offering me food or a place to stay, even when they owned little. When I set off, I was either suspicious of this generosity or racing too quickly onwards to consider stopping. But with time, I learned to let people in, and this led to deeper connections and more happiness. I wouldn’t have been able to reach Bhutan on a bicycle without facing a crisis or two. We will all face a crisis at some point. We might lick our wounds and get back in the saddle, but to find our way through a crisis psychologically, we need support from others. We also need to give ourselves time to make sense of what has happened and to ensure we move forward purposefully. These are all essential for resilience, and what helped me on my journey. Nothing beats lying under the stars after a full day’s cycle through the mountains. Humans are of nature, yet we spend so much of our time indoors in built-up, often contrived, social spaces that do not meet fundamental needs. Nature is essential for our well-being – not just to feel calm and peaceful in the moment, but to sustain human life for generations to come. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Christopher Boyce is an Honorary Research Associate at the Behavioural Science Centre, University of Stirling.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/justin-bieber-sells-back-catalogue-expert-explains-why-artists-give-up-rights-music/,[],"Justin Bieber is the latest artist in a growing list of musicians who have sold the rights to their music. This move is typically made by more seasoned artists such as Bruce Springsteen, who reportedly received $500 million (£406 million) for the sale of his life’s work in 2021, or Stevie Nicks, who sold a share of her publishing for $100 million in 2020. Bieber, at the age of 28, has sold his rights to all the music he released before 2022 for a reported $200 million. Merck Mercuriadis, founder and chief executive officer of Hipgnosis Song Management, who bought the rights, said: “This acquisition ranks among the biggest deals ever made for an artist under the age of 70.” Songs are protected by something called copyright. This is a legal right that the creators can sell or licence in order to make money from their music. Artists with deals sign over some, or most, of these rights to publishers and record labels. In fact, songs have more than one right attached to them. There is a right for the composition which can be owned by a publisher, one for the recording which can be owned by the record label and there are also rights in the performance of a song. All this means is that when a song is bought, or performed (e.g. played on the radio, in a film, or on TV) the money is divided between all those that have a stake in the music rights. Justin Bieber has a record deal with Universal Music Group and a publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG). So, he owned a percentage of his rights. He shares these rights with his publisher, which owns a percentage of his composition copyright and his record label, which owns a share of his rights attached to the recording of the songs, sometimes referred to as the master recordings. Bieber sold 100% of his share of his publishing copyright and performance rights, master recordings, and neighboring rights (the performance within the recording) for his entire back catalogue – which includes over 290 tracks – to investment company Hipgnosis Songs Capital. Hipgnosis buys catalogues of music and then manages the rights to make an income from the royalty payments. This means that when his songs are bought or performed, the share of the income that would have previously been a royalty payment to Bieber, now goes to Hipgnosis. The company is hoping that over time these royalties will exceed the upfront payment it made to Bieber and so it will profit from this investment. Copyright in the musical composition lasts for 70 years after the death of the creator, so the owner of the copyright can keep receiving royalties for a long time. However, the songs need to be used in order to make an income, so it is a risk. When artists tour, they can make money from ticket and merchandise sales, but they also receive a royalty when their music is performed. This sounds great, but the cost of touring is huge and continues to increase, so it doesn’t always turn a profit. Bieber doesn’t own his back catalogue anymore, so he won’t receive that royalty when he performs those songs. This is unlikely to affect his motivations to tour because it forms a smaller part of the income. So why would Bieber and other artists want to sell their rights, when they could keep this income for themselves? For artists who are thinking about retirement, it’s a way to enjoy the fruits of their labor and create a pension for themselves. It could be that, because of the pandemic, artists have sold their catalogue to compensate for loss of revenue while venues and other income streams were lost. Copyright is an asset that can be left in a will, so for the 70 years that copyright survives the creator, their royalties can go to their heirs. However, copyright must be managed and so it may be more attractive for some to cash-out and leave the administration to the purchaser. Bieber can still make royalty income on music that he creates from January 2022 onwards, so perhaps he has plans to release new music and in the meantime wanted to increase his current income. The singer had to take time off and postpone tour dates because of difficulties with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare virus that in his case caused facial paralysis, which may have contributed to his decision. The risk for Bieber is that, in the long term, he could have made more money from keeping his rights and receiving royalty payments than from the lump-sum payment. To make any more money from music, Bieber will now need to release new songs. In general, it is essential for artists to retain their rights so that they can continue to benefit from their music over time. There has been push back from the music industry on similar deals where catalogues are being collated by investment businesses buying out creator copyright. While it can seem very attractive to receive upfront cash, playing the long game can often be more beneficial for artists. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Hayleigh Bosher is a Senior Lecturer in Intellectual Property Law, Brunel University London.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-to-replace-queen-elizabeth-ii-image-banknote-design-honoring-indigenous-culture/,[],"SYDNEY, Australia – Australia will replace the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on its A$5 banknote with a new design to reflect and honor the history of its indigenous culture, the country’s central bank said on Thursday. The decision follows consultation with the federal government, which supports the change, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in a statement. The other side of the note will continue to feature the Australian Parliament, it said. Queen Elizabeth’s death in 2022 has reignited debate in Australia about its future as a constitutional monarchy. Voters narrowly chose to maintain the British monarch as its head of state in a 1999 referendum. The decision also comes as Australia’s center-left Labor government pushes for a referendum, required to alter the constitution, to recognize indigenous people in the document and require consultation with them on decisions that affect their lives. Australian authorities had said following the queen’s death that the image of King Charles III would not automatically replace her on A$5 notes, and that she might be replaced by Australian figures. The decision to include her image on the A$5 dollar note was about her personality as opposed to her status as the monarch, they said at the time. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is a long-standing republican, but had said after the death of the queen in September it was “not a time” for a debate on the role of the monarchy in Australia. Peter Dutton, leader of the main opposition Liberal Party, said the central bank’s decision was politically motivated. “There’s no question about this, that it’s directed by the government and I think the Prime Minister should own up to it,” he said on local radio station 2GB. The Reserve Bank said it would consult with Indigenous groups in designing the A$5 banknote. It will take a number of years to design and print the new banknote. Until then, the current note will continue to be issued. “This is a massive win for the grassroots, First Nations people who have been fighting to decolonize this country,” tweeted Lidia Thorpe, an opposition Green Party lawmaker of Indigenous descent. In 2021, Australia officially amended its national anthem to remove reference to the country being “young and free” amid calls to recognize that its Indigenous people are the oldest civilization in the world. The A$5 banknote is the only Australian banknote to carry the image of the Queen. Australian coins are mandated to carry the image of the British monarch and new coins will have the effigy of King Charles. King Charles is the head of state in Australia, New Zealand and 12 other Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom, although the role is largely ceremonial. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/new-school/opinion-problem-respecting-elders/,[],"I am 18. I am Filipino. These are two concepts of identity that define me, no matter how much I try to move past their boundaries. When these labels intersect to create me, it inherently places me at a crossroads, and I don’t know which direction to take. As with all crossroads, if I take one path, I can no longer take any of the others without walking backwards. A quote often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal is, “Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan.” The youth are the hope of the future. But many young Filipinos, including myself, feel unseen and unheard. And yet our voices are prominent and arguably the most important, with 56% of Filipino voters between the ages of 18-41. Why is it so easy, then, for young Filipinos to be dismissed on the basis of their age? It’s a question that many of us continue to ponder, and the answers lie deeply ingrained within our cultural identity. Take the 2022 Philippine elections as an example. Regardless of which candidate they supported, friends and acquaintances would end up exasperated whenever they would try and bring up their points of view to those older than they were. A friend from Cavite recounted to me how such political discussions with their mother would always devolve into pointless arguments. This friend supported the former vice president Leni Robredo, but was too young to vote. He firmly believed that to secure a better future for himself, it was essential for the former vice president to win the election. He advocated for this perspective, but was always met with stark opposition on the basis of his age. “Ang kapal ng mukha mo…. Mag-isip [ka] kahit wala kang utak,” A message from his mother read. A follow-up text ended the conversation, stating: “Wala kang respeto at kunsinsya [sic]…alam mong mas matanda ako kesa [sic] sayo. Makinig ka na lang sa akin.” An online acquaintance, meanwhile, recounted to me how political discussions had cost him his friendships. This friend supported the current President of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. He had just turned old enough to vote, and as such, didn’t have to convince others to attempt to secure what he believed was a better future for himself. In the few discussions he did have with friends about his voting preferences, however, he was almost immediately shut down by those older than he was and told not to speak. This acquaintance ended up becoming ostracized from the online community we were both part of, and his points of view were dismissed in the same manner. “Close-minded ka lang,” read a message targeted towards this acquaintance. “May pinagaralan ka ba?” Blatant dismissal when attempting to spark constructive and civil conversations constitutes a shared experience that young Filipinos know too well. With my own parents, squabbles over relatively insignificant matters such as what kind of rice to purchase or the correct way to assemble furniture would be met with phrases that young Filipinos could recite by heart: “Papunta ka pa lang, pabalik na ‘ko!” or “Wala ka bang respeto sa mas matanda sa ‘yo?“ It would be disingenuous to assert that this experience is one only felt by my generation. My parents, my ates and kuyas, and my ninangs and ninongs were told these phrases by their parents, their ates and kuyas, and their ninangs and ninongs. Our culture prides itself on valuing respect for our elders. It’s a concept that’s been ingrained in us since the pre-colonial era. The veneration of anito, our ancestral spirits, forms a core part of pre-colonial Filipino culture – one of the few pieces of our past that’s survived colonialism and its atrocities. And it is logical to value the wisdom and knowledge of our elders and those who came before us. Their lived experiences far surpass our own. We trust that those older than us would act in our best interests in line with their lived experiences. But many young Filipinos feel this trust has been eroded over time. An attempt at providing one’s own opinion will almost always be misconstrued. Phrases like “Wag ka nang sumabat,” or “Sumunod ka na lang,” have genuine intentions behind them, but are more often than not weaponized to suppress dissent. Many young Filipinos, especially those in the diaspora, would confer this to be a “toxic Filipino trait.” But I see it more as a generational defense mechanism. We Filipinos have been through trial after trial. From Spanish colonialism, to American and Japanese occupation, to the horrors of Martial Law, to the massacres and extrajudicial killings that have plagued every government since, the Filipino people have been repeatedly punished for dissenting. Learning to obey and learning not to question what you are told has kept us safe for centuries. To this day, protests and activism is a grave and dangerous action to undertake. It is still an expectation that as we grow older, we will learn to be more complacent, that eventually, “matututo ka nang hindi sumabat.” It is logical. It is rational. It has kept us alive. The Committee to Protect Journalists recently published figures showing a 50% increase in deaths among journalists from 2021 to 2022. Journalism is a profession that is built upon the foundations of asking questions and seeking truth. If even this is dismissed as dissent and met with violence, how do we expect the Filipino youth to respond in any other way than “matutong hindi sumabat?” I am a first generation immigrant, a member of the Filipino diaspora in Melbourne. My family holds many opposing points of view from my own. We are in conflict on matters of politics, of identity, of history, and of religion. I have recognized it to be a futile effort to try and spark conversations with them. As far as they are concerned, things should remain the way they are, and that eventually I would come to the same conclusions as they have. Until then, they are comfortable keeping me at arm’s length, distancing me from what they perceive to be a threat upon Filipino tradition. Only time will tell if they are correct. As for now, I am still 18. And as a member of the youth, I am faced with a crossroads that has two signs pointing opposite ways. One sign reads “Sumunod ka na lang,” and the other reads “Pero bakit?” – Rappler.com Juztin Banac, 18, is a university student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.

Simmons is hell-bent on winning all of his four games with the Road Warriors after dragging NLEX out of a 15-point hole in its come-from-behind 110-108 win over TNT in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Wednesday, February 1. The former NBA player erupted for 45 points on top of 12 rebounds and 3 steals as the Road Warriors stayed unbeaten in three games. He likes to keep it that way when he takes his exit against Phoenix on Saturday, February 4, at the Ynares Center in Antipolo. “A win. Nothing less but winning,” said Simmons when asked what should be expected from him against the Fuel Masters, who lost their first three games of the conference. Even as NLEX welcomes another former NBA player in Wayne Selden, coach Frankie Lim tried to convince Simmons to postpone his departure and play against Barangay Ginebra in a marquee matchup on February 8. After all, Simmons has already jelled with the team, averaging a staggering 36.7 points to go with 9.7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals. Simmons, though, needs to return to the Chinese Basketball Association as soon as possible. “I was asking him to stay one more game so he gets to play against Ginebra, but they want him to leave right away.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/ilonggo-notes-my-ati-atihan-dinagyang-memories/,[],"Iloilo City’s Dinagyang Festival returned on the fourth Sunday of January after a two-year hiatus (it went online because of the pandemic, and was voted the country’s top tourism event anyway by the Association of Tourism Officers of the Philippines). For the past decades I’ve had ambivalent feelings towards the 55-year-old festival. Perhaps that comes from a surfeit of having seen so many similar costumes and choreographed moves throughout the years, the traffic jams it engenders when the performance areas are being set up, and the monotony of drumbeats that start off the practice sessions of the “tribes” commencing roughly in mid-October. The last time I saw the competitions was back in 2015, which coincided with a visit to Iloilo, and then I figured, seeing it once every 10 years suffices. Nonetheless, it has become a top crowd drawer, and somehow manages to live up to hype. Dinagyang started as an offshoot of the more famed Kalibo Ati-Atihan. In 1968, a replica of the image of the Santo Niño de Cebu arrived in Iloilo, and was enshrined in the San Jose Placer Church run by the Augustinians. A solemn procession was organized around the plaza, and Ati-Atihan tribes from Aklan were invited. As in Kalibo, there was also a motley group of people who started dancing, mimicking the tribal rhythms with their own home-made, spontaneous “mixes” with school bands and drum and bugle corps, complimented by metal sticks banging on glass bottles. Each year the “Iloilo Ati-Atihan,” as it was known then, grew.  It was scheduled the weekend after the Kalibo festivities. In 1970, a tribe sponsored by the Compania Maritima, known as “Madjapahit,” won the initial competition. In 1974, the “Last Warriors” of Panaderia de Molo won the prestigious title, ending three years of domination by the “Ma-Mau” tribe sponsored by Negros Navigation. The Molo tribe innovatively used metal accessories, scrap parts from the iconic round biscuit cans, that jingled and tinkled, adding another dimension. Being in Iloilo in the early ’80s meant that the festival was something to look forward to, and the religious origins were prominent – people danced and pledges (“panata”) were made to the child Jesus. In 1978, when the national government encouraged local festivals, the city chose the Iloilo Ati-Atihan. In a naming contest, “Dinagyang” won out, derived from “dagyang” (“merry-making”). I was able to see the competitions up close from the early ’70s, as ROTC cadets were asked to form cordons and do crowd control. Major contenders such as Familia Sagasa, Himaya, Himala, and Atub-Atub developed their own distinctive drumbeat rhythm. Pedestrians would march and sway behind their favored groups, while others would make up their own beats and dance around to the boom-boom-BOOM! Boom-boom BOOM!, shouting “Hala Bira” “Pwera Pasma” (Give your all!/Illness be gone”), to which we’d add, “Sigue Dasok,” “Bisan Gutok” (Push it in/Even if tight), which refers to the crowds, with naughtier connotations. People would sometimes brush your face with soot, a move described as “palhitanay,” similar to the drenching of people on the day of St, John the Baptist. One would be ill-advised to wear new or light-colored clothing. We would return from the merrymaking hoarse, tipsy, and drenched in sweat. One year, I saw my usually proper aunt, one of Iloilo’s best known businesswomen, still coiffed, in her orange pantsuit, doing the “sadsad” walk, to the beat of drums, just slightly tipsy, San Mig in hand. Houses and shops lining the parade route would be packed. The Vidal house fronting St. Paul’s hospital would have one of their huge kapis shell windows, ventanillas open, allocated to our family as my mom and aunt were dear friends and colleagues of the owners, while others would be occupied by priests from the University of San Agustin and sisters from the Assumption convent. Merienda would be served. Reminiscing this now, it had this “tertulia-like” setting from a Nick Joaquin novel, albeit a more energetic one. Once, the Binirayan festival tribe from Antique upended the best ones from Iloilo – with a secret weapon – all the troop members were female, they had mottled brown and gray as main colors, moved like graceful stalks being tossed about in the wind, the rustle of their costumes and their hissing sounds a complete contrast to the heart-pounding beats we were used to. Undoubtedly the model for the Dinagyang is Kalibo’s Ati-atihan festival, which is centuries old. Felix Laureano, the first Filipino photographer, who in the 1890s had studios in Iloilo, Hong Kong, and Barcelona, was not impressed. In Recuerdos de Filipinas (1895), he has a photograph of an Ati group dancing, and writes: “to the monotonous pealing of the wooden Agung (a type of gong made from a hollowed out trunk), the Aetas carry out an unintelligible pantomime. Struck with a wood clapper, it produces sonorous, cacophonous vibrations that hurt the eardrums…at a command from their chief, armed with arrows and spears, they act out their own version of a war dance, changing places by the second, howling and shouting…they sing without intonation, harmony nor desire…their chants like the barks of dogs, and lasting for five to six hours…it lacks scenic interest, and has no appeal….” He adds that the dances are similar to those performed by Igorots in the 1887 Madrid exposition. The descriptions leave no doubt that Laureano preferred jotas and rigodons. It is interesting to speculate how the war dances became devotions to the infant Jesus, then a caricature of the Ati ways (Ati-Atihan means “doing it like the Atis”) morphing into the spectacle that it is today. The term “cultural appropriation” comes to mind, and nowadays many of the Panay Bukidnon and Atis might be scratching their heads in puzzlement as marching bands, salsa-like moves, exotic costumes, and Broadway take over. It’s been about 40 years since I last went to Kalibo for the Ati-Ati. Once, we stayed at the second floor of a funeral parlor, joking that if there were no beds available, the empty coffins downstairs would do just fine. Comparisons between the two festivals are inevitable – one, “the original,” “you really feel the spirit;” the other “more showy, elaborate costumes, more of a spectacle.” Being away for over 35 years, and eight years since my last Dinagyang, I was looking forward to things Ilonggo, and experiencing the Dinagyang Festival once more. I was offered a complimentary ticket for the performance, normally P3,000, but declined. Long lines to the grandstands, having longer waiting times than actual performances, people fawning over politicians and so-called celebrities, and being restricted to a chair for four hours was not appealing. I wanted to see the festival on foot again, wandering around the main heritage district of the city, with my trusty bicycle. Back in the ’80s, with so many competing tribes, the parade seemed endless – in later years the tribes were screened and a separate parade, on Saturday – would be for the “Kasadyahan,” which accommodated other groups, while Sundays would be reserved for the centerpiece competition. This year, Kasadyahan had representation from outside of Iloilo — such as La Carlota (Negros), Culasi (Antique), etc. This adds additional fervor and flavor, as each group represents their own local shindigs.  Prize money is offered, usually half of that of the Dinagyang pot. This year, in addition to the Kasadyahan and the Dinagyang, there was an evening competition called “ILOmination.” Groups would have costumes and props that lit up. Three stages were set up along the malls in the newer city commercial areas. However, for someone watching streetside, without a ticket, it was not worth the long waiting time. It should be moved to the heritage district, and lighted parols of Pampanga would be a beautiful addition to the lighted floats. “Parianon” tribe of Molo was the grand winner of Dinagyang 2023, bagging a P1 million prize. I didn’t see them perform live. They’d show their full repertoire at the Freedom grandstand, which had the largest performance area, and parts of their routines on the main streets along the four-kilometer parade route; no joke if you are blackened in soot and wearing an enormous headdress. A caravan of drummers, musicians, stage hands, and vehicles bearing wigs, costumes, props, and riser stages trails each group.  It is a major production that entails months of preparation, often under wraps, lest others “steal” the ideas, the beats and the moves. One other attraction of Dinagyang week are the many side events – the Opening Salvo, fluvial parade, processions, masses and novenas, bicycle races, sports events, art exhibits, food festivals, and others.  Added treats this year were two free concerts by the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra – both packed – and the opening of the Museum of National Maritime history. Economic benefits to the city and the various businesses are enormous. The performing tribes and their retinues keep thousands busy months before the festival. Visitors, in a festive mood, are happy to spend for accommodations, transport, food, drink, and pasalubong, adding significantly to the city’s coffers. Small entrepreneurs – street food and drinks vendors, face painters, and souvenir sellers do brisk business. Costumed warriors accept tips from those wishing to pose with them; also seen were horses with saddles, and exotic pets – iguanas and an albino Burmese python – for photo opportunities and a fee. One can easily rack up 20,000 steps a day during the weekend, since the city center and surrounding street blocks and bridges are off limits to vehicles. There are numerous options for food and coffee breaks in the downtown area. Several streets are allocated for pop-up food stalls; spots like Plaza Libertad and Muelle Loney had picnickers. I sneaked into the newly open Maritime History Museum with its grand neoclassic lobby, its air conditioners humming. However, apprehension about the pandemic lingers, so I opted to wear a mask even in open streets, to reduce risks of transmission from any circulating viruses. One has to guard against possible pickpockets too. Finding space to park my bike was a breeze — I was the only one using the bike racks near the Drilon bridge, which is perfect for a take-off and venture into the downtown area a block away. Bag and security checks were done at various entry points. The old city center became walkable again, even just for a few hours that weekend. The jamming of cell phone signals at certain hours made it feel like a throwback to the 20th century – people talking to each other, only whipping phones out to take photos. That decision was later flayed on social media, as other areas well outside the city centers were inconvenienced because of the block. Families with young children were a pleasant sight, many had painted faces, clearly enjoying the perfect weather that day. And this year, also impressive was the way the streets were cleared up after the festival. With the stages and overdue parols now dismantled, Iloilo takes a breather – until the next Dinagyang. – Rappler.com Vic Salas is a physician and public health specialist by training, and now retired from international consulting work.

The Philippines’ Japan Home Centre (JHC) will be accepting the elusive (and expensive) sibuyas (onion) as payment for select in-store items only on Saturday, February 4. In a Wednesday, February 2 Facebook post, the retail store announced its first “pay with sibuyas” promo, where they will accept one onion in exchange for the customer’s chosen product. A maximum of three items per purchase will be allowed per customer. The promo is exclusive to Japan Home Centre’s Panay Avenue branch only, located at 84 Panay Avenue, Quezon City, near Victoria Towers. All collected onions will be used for a community pantry, JHC said. They will also still accept cash and coins for the select items. There are no specific details on the size or kinds of onion yet, but might as well bring a variety if you can! Japan Home Centre is “the country’s first and original Japanese discount P88 store.” According to its website, it traces its humble beginnings to an old warehouse in Quezon City. The brand opened its first branch in 2004 in Market! Market!, Taguig City. Currently, the Philippines is seeing skyrocketing, anti-competitive prices of onions in the market. Based on the Department of Agriculture (DA)’s price monitoring data, local red onions were sold in markets for P480 to P600 per kilo, and white onions at around P450 to P700.

After missing their first four shots of overtime and watching an Andrew Wiggins dunk put Golden State up, 112-110, the Timberwolves got a second chance on their fifth possession. Kyle Anderson swatted a Taurean Prince miss to Austin Rivers, who in turn found Prince for the go-ahead three-pointer with 2:58 remaining. Edwards scored on a drive and a 10-footer on Minnesota’s next two possessions, and the Timberwolves took advantage of the Warriors’ 2-for-8 shooting in overtime to avenge an earlier 137-114 home defeat to Golden State and win for the fourth time in their past five games. Seeking a fourth straight win, the Warriors led by as many as 14 early in the fourth quarter before needing a Curry layup with 1:39 to go just to pull into a 110-110 tie. Neither team scored again in regulation, with the Warriors getting the best opportunity when Curry misfired on an open jump shot with 6.1 seconds left. After a timeout, the best the Timberwolves could get was a desperation 30-footer by D’Angelo Russell that missed the mark, sending Minnesota to overtime for the second straight game. Despite fouling out in OT, Russell led the Timberwolves with 29 points, 21 of which coming on 7-for-17 accuracy from beyond the arc. Edwards had 27 points and 5 assists, while Naz Reid contributed 24 points and 13 rebounds in place of Rudy Gobert, who sat out with a sore right groin.

Fortunately, we don’t have to visit the sandy shores to enjoy the bounty of fresh options that are available, even here in Metro Manila. With an abundance of frozen seafood in grocery stores nationwide, these three recipes can be made in a pinch, with only a few added herbs and spices. This dish is nostalgic for me. As a kid, we didn’t eat out in restaurants a lot. In fact, it was usually a very special occasion when we would indulge in dining out. If it was a graduation or something the whole family enjoyed, we usually would go to the same few Chinese restaurants for a family meal. But sometimes, we would eat Italian. And when we would, someone would always order Mussels Marinara. Typically, I would use a small white onion for this quick recipe, but because the cost of onions has gone up so much, I opted to use a few shallots instead. It did not affect the taste or cooking time at all. 250g mussels
25g sliced garlic
50g diced onions
5g fresh herbs (parsley & basil)
100g fresh tomatoes
200g mussels
100g dry white wine
225g marinara sauce (I used San Remo) Sauté the garlic, onions, and herbs in extra virgin olive oil. Add the tomatoes and cook until blistered. After the tomatoes are softened, add the mussels, white wine, and marinara sauce. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes. Garnish with more fresh herbs and serve with crusty bread. Olive oil-based pasta sauces are always easy to throw together in a jiffy, especially when you have seafood that is fresh and easy to use. The beauty in this dish is that the Pacific Bay frozen clams are actually blanched and the package has its own juice! Be sure to use all of it! Varying the different types of seafood here can change up the dish quickly. I have seen this made with shrimp, calamari rings, and even lobster. Keeping this simple, I used jumbo shrimp, baby clams, local scallops, and Chilean mussels, all frozen fresh and double-packed. 1c EVOO
50g sliced garlic
5g fresh chopped parsley
5g fresh chopped basil
250g frozen White Clams
150g Jumbo Shrimp
200g Chilean Mussels
200g dry white wine
1 pat butter
300g cooked linguine In a large saucepan, sauté the garlic and herbs in extra virgin olive oil. Once fragrant, add the clams and mussels, being sure to include the juices that they are packed in. After a few minutes add in the scallops and shrimp. Add the white wine and bring to a quick boil, cooking until just firm. Add a small pat of butter in the sauce and then toss the linguine in the sauce pan to coat the pasta through. Serve immediately. Sourcing fish that is sushi-grade is not always an easy task. So many components can be included according to your preference, and in this case the added tamago made this bowl special. It doesn’t take long to make and if you have the ingredients on-hand it’s a fun addition. 300g Salmon Poke
130g Soy sauce
13g Sesame oil
15g Rice wine vinegar
7g Lemon juice
7g grated ginger
3g grated garlic
Cooked rice Variety of toppings can include:
Pickled ginger, radish or cucumbers
Edamame
Tamago
Cherry Tomatoes Drain salmon and set aside to prepare marinade. To prepare the marinade, mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and ginger. Add the salmon and set aside for 10 minutes. Arrange all the fresh ingredients on top of the bed of rice, saving the marinated salmon for last. Serve immediately. Creating healthy seafood dishes with fresh ingredients is easy when you can pull them out of the refrigerator or freezer. Being mindful of what we eat begins with making sure that our ingredients are sustainable and better for us, too. If they are all sourced locally? Well, that’s even better.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-targets-global-sanctions-evasion-network-supporting-russia/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The United States on Wednesday, February 1, imposed sanctions on 22 individuals and entities in multiple countries that it accused of being tied to a global sanctions evasion network supporting Russia’s military-industrial complex. The sanctions, which come as Washington looks to increase pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, are part of US efforts to target the evasion of its punitive measures around the world and limit Russia’s access to revenue it needs for the war, the US Treasury Department said in a statement. The action targeted a sanctions evasion network that the Treasury said is led by Russia and Cyprus-based arms dealer Igor Zimenkov, who, along with his son, Jonatan, were hit with sanctions on Wednesday. The network has engaged in projects connected to Russian defense capabilities, including supplying high-technology devices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Treasury said. Washington also accused certain members of the network of supporting state-owned Russian defense entities under sanctions. Zimenkov has also supported the Belarusian military-industrial complex by facilitating sales efforts in Latin America for a Belarusian defense entity under US sanctions, Treasury said. Members of the network targeted included Singapore-based Asia Trading & Construction PTE Limited and its director, which Treasury accused of having sold helicopters on behalf of US-sanctioned Rostec to a government in Latin America. GBD Limited, another company in the network targeted in the sanctions, has attempted to supply weapons systems to an African government, Treasury said. Companies in Cyprus, Bulgaria and Israel, as well as several people, were also targeted for sanctions. The Russian Embassy in the United States said such “illegal steps” taken by Washington would not achieve their goal. “The Russian economy remains far from being ‘in tatters’, as some in the West hope,” it said. The action, which freezes any US assets of those added to the sanctions list and generally bars Americans from dealing with them, marks the latest round of US sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine, which has killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble. “Russia’s desperate attempts to utilize proxies to circumvent US sanctions demonstrate that sanctions have made it much harder and costlier for Russia’s military-industrial complex to resupply Putin’s war machine,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-united-states-agree-new-sites-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines and the United States have agreed on four new local bases in the country where American troops will be allowed to build facilities and preposition defense assets, nearly nine years after both countries signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Officials from the two countries made the announcement on Thursday, February 2, as US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the Philippines for the first time under the Marcos administration. “Today, the Philippines and the United States are proud to announce their plans to accelerate the full implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the agreement to designate four new Agreed Locations in strategic areas of the country and the substantial completion of the projects in the existing five Agreed Locations,” a joint readout said. Philippine Defense Secretary Galvez declined to give details on where the four new EDCA sites were located, saying the coordination was still ongoing with local government units. The announcement was met with protests outside the Philippine military headquarters, with militant activists demanding the Marcos administration scrap the military deal. In a press briefing, Austin highlighted the message that the addition of new EDCA sites would not lead to a return of US bases in the Philippines. “We’re not seeking permanent basing,” he said. Details on the specific locations of new sites were not immediately available, but Philippine officials earlier said locations being considered for access included Philippine bases in Northern Luzon and Palawan, sites near Taiwan, and the West Philippine Sea. The five new EDCA locations are in addition to sites previously identified in March 2016, including Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan; Basa Air Base in Pampanga; Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija; Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro; and, Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu. “The United States and the Philippines have committed to move quickly in agreeing to the necessary plans and investments for the new and existing EDCA locations,” officials said. The addition of new EDCA sites is the latest development after the two countries earlier agreed to strengthen military ties against the backdrop of rising tensions with China. In a meeting between Galvez and Austin, the US reaffirmed that the two countries’ Mutual Defense Treaty would cover any attack in the South China Sea, where China continues to assert its claims in areas including Philippine waters. “We remain committed to strengthening our mutual capacities to resist armed attack. This is part of our effort to modernize our alliance and these efforts are especially important as People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea,” Austin said, using the Philippines’ official name for its waters. Experts and regional observers have been speculating in the past few months that the new EDCA sites would include bases located in Northern Luzon owing to the region’s proximity to Taiwan, which shares a sea border off the northernmost part of the Philippines. Following increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait last August 2022, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez, a cousin of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., said that Manila would let US forces access Philippine bases “if it is important for us, for our own security.” High on Austin’s agenda while in Manila was “speeding up” the implementation of EDCA. In a meeting with Marcos on Thursday morning, Austin continued to carry Washington’s message underscoring the Philippines as a “key” and “important” ally of the US, adding that their bilateral relationship should be further strengthened “in every way possible.” “From the defense perspective, we will continue to work together with our great partners to build and modernize your capabilities,” he said. Philippine and US defense officials said new EDCA bases would allow for more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters as well as response “to other shared challenges.” “The Philippine-US Alliance has stood the test of time and remains ironclad. We look forward to the opportunities these new sites will create to expand our cooperation together,” officials said. Analysts had viewed the implementation of EDCA as a “big deliverable” in Philippine-US defense ties, pointing to the deal as essential for both countries to live up to their commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty, which sees both sides commit to defend one another in case of an attack. The Biden administration has been optimistic that defense ties with the Philippines could expand, after a turnaround seen under the final months of the previous Duterte administration, as well as the openness of a new Marcos administration. The Philippines is also expected to see a boost in US military aid, with US officials allocating a potential $100 million in defense financing for the Southeast Asian country. This would be on top of over $82 million already allocated toward infrastructure investments at the existing five sites under the EDCA and does not include funding from the US Department of Defense. In November 2022, the Philippines’ Department of National Defense said the construction of EDCA projects in three more military bases was expected in 2023, after the US agreed to spend $66.5 million to start building training and warehouse facilities. Like in the case of the Visiting Forces Agreement, then-president Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to scrap EDCA early in his term, saying he did not want to see soldiers of “any foreign power” in the Philippines. Despite this, Duterte later upheld EDCA in a meeting with then-US president Donald Trump in 2017, though its implementation remained slow with the construction of just one site that began in 2018. – Rappler.com"

There were no immediate reports of serious casualties. The military said its air strikes targeted rocket and weapon production sites used by Hamas, the Islamist group than runs the blockaded strip, in response to Wednesday’s rocket launch. Powerful explosions shook buildings and lit up the night sky over Gaza as warning sirens sounded again in Israeli areas around the strip warning of more incoming rocket fire before dawn on Thursday. There was no claim of responsibility for Wednesday’s rocket from Hamas or the smaller Iran-backed Islamic Jihad movement, which fired rockets at Israel last week. The armed wing of the leftist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine said it had launched rocket salvos at Israel early on Thursday in response to the air strikes and the “systematic aggression” against Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The exchange of fire underlined the tensions between Israel and the Palestinians after a Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people near a synagogue in East Jerusalem and an Israeli raid in a West Bank refugee camp killed 10 Palestinians. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged calm upon wrapping up a visit to the region on Tuesday, in which he reaffirmed Washington’s support for a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict. Top US diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, and US special representative for Palestinian affairs, Hady Amr, remained behind to continue de-escalation talks between the sides. In a tweet sent after Wednesday’s rocket launch, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees prisons, said he would push ahead with plans to toughen conditions for Palestinian prisoners. “The rocket fire from Gaza will not stop me from continuing efforts to cancel summer camp conditions for murderous terrorists,” he said, adding that he had asked the security cabinet to convene.

In the closed door pre-pageant interview released by the Miss Universe organization on Tuesday, February 1, the Filipina-American beauty queen also looked back at the “dark times” in her pageant journey and how such “hardship made [her] stronger.” It can be recalled that R’Bonney’s Miss USA win was hounded by controversy when several candidates claimed that the pageant was rigged, and that a winner was already predetermined before it was even announced during the October 2022 coronation night. “It was very sad to see because it felt like all my hard work felt overshadowed,” she recalled, admitting that she questioned why it was happening and felt like she didn’t deserve the crown. She added that the false allegations were “detrimental to [her] mindset going forward for Miss USA.” “It was very sad for me for people to think that I would’ve lied my way to get here after all the hard work.” R’Bonney then emphasized that she’s working hard to show everyone that she deserves to be representing the USA in the Miss Universe stage, hoping that “time will allow people to see more of who [she is].” “I’ve shown people resiliency. And I’ve learned to strand strong in who I am and stand strong in my truth,” she said. R’Bonney was also asked about the importance of diversity in the United States. To which she replied, “I think it’s so important. Diversity, it really cultivates an open mindset…. It really allows us not to judge.” “I’m actually the first Filipina-American Miss USA and since I won, there are little girls that message me and they say they see themselves in me,” she shared. “I love that they can see how a woman that looks like me also looks like them. I need girls to believe in themselves, and diversity just makes every[body] feel seen.” She also mentioned how supportive the Filipino community has been of her pageant journey. R’Bonney, who’s only been joining pageants for the past three years, emphasized that there’s more to pageantry than just the glamor of photoshoots and the runway. “I’m very focused on showing people the hard work behind it and the advocacy.… It’s really about what you want to give to the world,” she said, adding that she has “big shoes to fill” if she ever wins the Miss Universe crown. “I hope my reign shows everybody that you can be a hard worker and achieve anything you want in your own unique way,” she said. Aside from R’Bonney, the Miss Universe organization has also released the closed door pre-pageant interviews of the Top 16 candidates. R’Bonney took home the Miss Universe 2022 crown in January.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-cardinal-pell-funeral-protests-mourners/,[],"SYDNEY, Australia – Mourners and protesters faced off in Sydney on Thursday at the funeral service for Australian Cardinal George Pell, a former top Vatican official who was acquitted in 2020 of sexual abuse accusations. Australian police officials said they had dropped a court bid to block a protest after organisers agreed to change an initial demonstration route and gather in a road adjacent to St Mary’s Cathedral, the funeral venue. Hundreds took part in the protest. Pell’s body has lain in state since he died at the age of 81 in a Rome hospital in January from heart complications after a hip surgery. Thousands attended the funeral, including former prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard, and federal opposition leader Peter Dutton. Hundreds more watched on big screens erected outside the cathedral. “He’s the greatest Catholic Australia has ever produced, and one of our country’s greatest sons,” Abbott said during a eulogy. “George Pell was the greatest man I’ve ever known.” In a park opposite the cathedral, groups of protesters, many from the LGBT community and some holding signs reading “Pell Burn In Hell,” heard speeches against the cardinal and the Catholic Church. “(We’re here to) just show solidarity with the victims and the survivors of what’s happened through the Catholic Church, but particularly George Pell,” Layne Elbourne, a musician, told Reuters. Small numbers of mourners held up rosary beads in response to protesters’ chants, though there were no signs of physical clashes between the two groups. Tensions had flared on Wednesday after some inside the church property were seen removing colorful ribbons tied by protesters along the fence of the cathedral, television footage showed. The ribbons symbolized the pain inflicted on child sexual abuse victims, the protesters said. Australia’s High Court in 2020 quashed the convictions of Pell, a leading Catholic conservative, for sexually assaulting two choir boys in the 1990s, allowing him to walk free after 13 months in prison. Pell lived in Rome after the acquittal and had several meetings with Pope Francis. – Rappler.com"

The “amicable and mutually agreeable settlement” ends a $2-billion row over surface damage on the long-haul jets. The spat led to the withdrawal of billions of dollars’ worth of jet deals by Airbus and prompted Qatar to increase purchases from Boeing. Canceled orders for 23 undelivered A350s and 50 smaller A321neos have been restored under the new deal, which is also expected to see Airbus pay several hundred million dollars to the Gulf carrier, while winning a reprieve from other claims. Financial details were not publicly disclosed. The companies said neither admitted liability. Both pledged to drop claims and “move forward and work together as partners.” The deal heads off what amounted to an unprecedented public divorce trial between heavyweights in the normally tight-knit and secretive $150-billion jet industry. The two sides had piled up combined claims worth about $2 billion ahead of the June trial. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the deal, which came in the wake of increasing political involvement amid close ties between France, where Airbus is based, and Qatar. “It is the culmination of significant joint efforts. It is excellent news for the French aerospace industry,” he said. Airbus shares closed up 1% before the announcement. Qatar Airways had taken the unusual step of publicly challenging the world’s largest planemaker over safety after paint cracks exposed gaps in a sub-layer of lightning protection on its new-generation A350 carbon-composite jets. Airbus had acknowledged quality flaws but insisted that the jets were safe and backed by European regulators, and accused the airline of exaggerating flaws to win compensation. Supported by a growing army of lawyers, both sides repeatedly bickered in preliminary hearings over access to documents, to the growing frustration of a judge forced to order cooperation. Analysts said the deal would allow both sides to feel vindicated, with Qatar Airways winning damages and recognition that the problem lay outside the manual and therefore required a new repair, and Airbus standing its ground on safety and spared the difficult task of finding a home for canceled A350s. Qatar will get the in-demand A321neos needed to plan its growth, albeit three years later than expected, in 2026. Airbus’ decision to revoke that order, separate from the disputed A350 contract, had been criticized by the International Air Transport Association. Airbus said it had done its best to avoid pushing Qatar too far back in the queue, though some experts question whether it could have met the earlier schedule because of supply problems. The settlement is also expected to stop the clock ticking on a claim for grounding compensation that had been growing by $6 million a day, triggered by a clause agreed upon after the repainting of a jet for the World Cup revealed significant surface damage. Originally valued at $200,000 per day per plane, Airbus’ theoretical liability was ratcheting upwards by a total of $250,000 an hour for 30 jets – or $2 billion a year – by the time the deal was struck, based on court filings. Neither side commented on settlement details. Airbus said it would now work with the airline and regulators to provide the necessary “repair solution” and return Qatar’s 30 grounded planes to the air. Confirmation of a settlement came after Reuters reported a deal could arrive as early as Wednesday. In 2021, a Reuters investigation revealed other airlines had been affected by A350 skin degradation, all of whom said it was “cosmetic.” The dispute has focused attention on the design of modern carbon-fiber jets, which do not interact as smoothly with paint as traditional metal ones, and shed light on industrial methods. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/india-adani-group-abandons-share-sale-february-2023/,[],"NEW DELHI, India – Gautam Adani’s flagship firm called off its $2.5-billion share sale in a dramatic reversal on Wednesday, February 1, as a rout sparked by a US short-seller’s criticisms wiped billions more off the value of the Indian tycoon’s stocks. The withdrawal of the Adani Enterprises share offering marks a stunning setback for Adani, the school dropout-turned-billionaire whose fortunes rose rapidly in recent years in line with the stock values of his businesses. “Today the market has been unprecedented, and our stock price has fluctuated over the course of the day. Given these extraordinary circumstances, the company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct,” Adani said. “Our balance sheet is very healthy with strong cash flows and secure assets, and we have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt. This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans,” the billionaire added in a statement to Indian exchanges. Adani, whose global business interests span ports, airports, mining, cement, and power, is battling to stabilize his companies and defend his reputation. “Once the market stabilizes, we will review our capital market strategy,” he added. The January 24 report has triggered an $86-billion erosion in market capitalization of seven listed Adani Group companies. On Wednesday, a day after Adani’s share sale closed, his group company stocks plummeted, with shares in Adani Enterprises plunging 28% and others also seeing sharp cuts. A report by Hindenburg Research last week alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation by the Adani Group. It also raised concerns about high debt and the valuations of seven listed Adani companies. Adani Group has denied the allegations, saying the short-seller’s allegation of stock manipulation has “no basis” and stems from an ignorance of Indian law. The group has always made the necessary regulatory disclosures, it added. “The pain hitting Adani companies was crippling, so the news that the share sale is called off is troubling, as this was supposed to show the company is still believed in by its high net-worth investors,” said Edward Moya, a New York-based senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA. “To go through this exercise of a share sale and to call it off raises more questions.” Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday, citing a person with direct knowledge, that India’s market regulator is examining the rout in the shares of Adani Group, looking into several of the allegations made by Hindenburg Research, and into any potential irregularities in a share sale by Adani Enterprises. Hindenburg had disclosed that it holds short positions in Adani companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. After the share sale was pulled, yields of dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani companies rose on Wednesday. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Yields of Adani Green Energy’s $500-million bonds due in 2024 rose to 15.45% on Wednesday from 12.1%. The fundraising was critical for Adani, not just because it would have helped cut his group’s debt, but also because it was being seen by some as a gauge of confidence as he faced the biggest business and reputational challenge of his career. Adani Group was working with its bankers to refund the proceeds received in the secondary share sale of Adani Enterprises. Anchor investors who had supported the issue included Maybank Securities and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The company aims to protect the interests of its investing community by returning the proceeds, it said. Adani Group had on Tuesday, January 31, mustered enough support from investors for the share sale to proceed, in what some saw as a stamp of investor confidence amid the storm. Wednesday’s stock losses saw Adani slip to 15th on the Forbes rich list with an estimated net worth of $75.1 billion, below rival Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, who ranks ninth with a net worth of $83.7 billion. The share sale had succeeded on Tuesday even when the Adani Enterprises stock price in Mumbai markets traded below the offer price of the share sale. While concerns had mounted the share sale may not succeed, and bankers even considered price cuts and timeline changes, Adani issued statements saying it was confident about its prospects and that all of its investors were standing by its side. “I do not know how the markets will behave in short term. But this is a measure to enhance [Adani’s] reputation since the investors were staring at a 30% loss even before the shares were allotted,” said Rajesh Baheti, chief executive, Crossseas Capital Services, an algo trading firm. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-statement-united-states-drills-february-2-2023/,[],"SEOUL, South Korea – North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, February 2, that drills by the United States and its allies have pushed the situation to an “extreme red-line” and threaten to turn the peninsula into a “huge war arsenal and a more critical war zone.” The statement, carried by state news agency KCNA, said Pyongyang was not interested in dialogue as long as Washington pursues hostile policies. “The military and political situation on the Korean peninsula and in the region has reached an extreme red-line due to the reckless military confrontational maneuvers and hostile acts of the US and its vassal forces,” an unnamed ministry spokesperson said in the statement. In Washington, the White House rejected the North Korean statement and reiterated a willingness to meet with North Korean diplomats “at a time and place convenient for them.” “We have made clear we have no hostile intent toward the DPRK and seek serious and sustained diplomacy to address the full range of issues of concern to both countries and the region,” said a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council. The statement cited a visit to Seoul this week by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. On Tuesday, February 1, Austin and his South Korean counterpart vowed to expand military drills and deploy more “strategic assets,” such as aircraft carriers and long-range bombers, to counter North Korea’s weapons development and prevent a war. “This is a vivid expression of the US dangerous scenario which will result in turning the Korean peninsula into a huge war arsenal and a more critical war zone,” the North Korean statement said. North Korea will respond to any military moves by the United States, and has strong counteraction strategies, including “the most overwhelming nuclear force” if necessary, the statement added. More than 28,500 American troops are based in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty. Last year, North Korea conducted a record number of ballistic missile tests, which are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions. It was also observed reopening its shuttered nuclear weapons test site, raising expectations of a nuclear test for the first time since 2017. In New York, South Korea’s foreign minister, Park Jin, met with the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday and called for the UN’s continued attention to North Korea’s recent provocations and efforts to implement sanctions on the reclusive regime. Guterres said North Korea’s additional nuclear test will deal a devastating blow to regional and international security, and reaffirmed support to build lasting peace on the Korean peninsula, according to Park’s office. Park is on a four-day trip to the United States, which will include a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington on Friday, February 3. On Wednesday the United States and South Korea carried out a joint air drill with American B-1B heavy bombers and F-22 stealth fighters, as well as F-35 jets from both countries, according to South Korea’s Defense Ministry. “The combined air drills this time show the US’ will and capabilities to provide strong and credible extended deterrence against North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/brazil-congress-reelects-leaders-victory-for-lula/,[],"BRASILIA, Brazil – Brazil’s Congress on Wednesday, February 1, reelected the leaders of both chambers who were backed by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a victory that will help him advance his legislative agenda and curb the influence of his right-wing opponents. Senator Rodrigo Pacheco defeated an ally of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, winning 49 votes in the 82-member chamber to continue as Senate president. Lula’s center-left coalition celebrated the vote count that would allow his government to push through constitutional amendments, such as those needed to change Brazil’s tax regime and create a new fiscal anchor to balance government accounts. Pacheco held his leadership job despite attempts made by Bolsonaro to back senator Rogerio Marinho. Bolsonaro, who had remained silent in reclusion in Florida, spoke by telephone on Monday, January 30, to a meeting of his party, the Liberal Party (PL), to boost his former Cabinet minister’s campaign. In the lower house, Speaker Arthur Lira of the center-right Popular Party (PP) won reelection by a wide margin, with the support of Lula’s Workers Party and its coalition partners, along with some of Bolsonaro’s allies. Lira, who won 464 votes in the 513-seat house, had been an ally of Bolsonaro, but was quick to recognize Lula’s narrow election victory in October and congratulate him, starting a dialogue during the presidential transition. Control of either chamber by the opposition could have hampered approval of Lula’s priorities, starting with temporary decrees he has signed that extend social welfare payments for poor families and reduce taxes on fuels. All legislation must cross Lira’s desk to get started in Congress, including impeachment motions, which Bolsonaro allies are already planning against Lula. In their victory speeches, both congressional leaders strongly defended Brazil’s democratic system, which came under attack from Bolsonaro supporters who stormed government buildings on Jan. 8 calling for a military coup to restore their leader who left the country without conceding defeat by Lula. Pacheco, who rejected Bolsonaro’s criticism of Brazil’s electronic voting system, said the divided country needs pacification and political harmony. But he added: “Pacification does not mean remaining silent before anti-democratic acts,” referring to the riots and calling for accountability. Lira condemned the violence by Bolsonaro supporters. “In today’s Brazil there is no more space for those who attack the institutions that symbolize our democracy. This chamber will not accept, defend or endorse any act, speech or demonstration that violates democracy,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/sandiganbayan-decision-ex-dbm-undersecretary-mario-relampagos-pdaf-related-charges/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Former Department of Budget and Management (DBM) undersecretary Mario Relampagos walked free from 11 graft charges related to the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam after the Sandiganbayan granted his petition. In a 118-page resolution issued on January 26, the anti-graft court’s Fourth Division granted the demurrer to evidence filed by the former DBM official. The charges were in relation to the alleged fraud committed in the release of a P107-million PDAF budget of former Masbate lawmaker Rizalina Seachon-Lanete. Lanete allegedly misused her PDAF allocation for which the Ombudsman filed cases against her in 2015. The former Masbate lawmaker was accused of pocketing P108.4 million from her PDAF or “pork barrel” from 2007 to 2009 when she was a member of Congress. The ruling on Relampagos was penned by Associate Justice Lorifel Lacap Pahimna, with concurrence of Associate Justices Michael Frederick L. Musngi and Bayani H. Jacinto. The court, in siding with Relampagos on the petition, said there was insufficient evidence to pin down the former undersecretary for alleged conspiracy with Lanete and alleged PDAF mastermind Janet Napoles. The Sandiganbayan’s latest ruling has the effect of an acquittal because it said there was insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution when it tried to prove the alleged criminal offense. “Thus, a reading of the records reveals that the prosecution failed to show proof how accused Relampagos, in conspiracy with the other accused, unduly accommodated the accused private individuals when he allegedly participated in the processing of the SAROs,” the anti-graft court said. In the resolution, the Sandiganbayan agreed with the defense’s position, which pointed out that Relampagos was not a signatory in the special allotment release orders (SAROs) and notices of cash allowance (NCAs). The documents were used for the release of Lanete’s alleged pork barrel. The documents also showed that the late former budget chief Rolando Andaya Jr. was the one who signed the SAROs, while the NCAs were signed by Andaya and Carmencita Delantar. The anti-graft court said that even if Relampagos signed the documents, this cannot be considered a crime since it was part of his ministerial duty. He thus enjoys the presumption of regularity. In addition, the court added that the only time the former DBM official was linked to the PDAF transactions was in the testimony of Benhur Luy, the prosecution’s witness. Luy earlier said their contact in the alleged release of the pork barrel were under the “office of Usec. Relampagos,” and not specifically the former DBM official himself. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-stock-markets-currencies-oil-prices-february-1-2023/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – A gauge of global stocks rallied and the US dollar slumped on Wednesday, February 1, after the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by the expected 25 basis points (bps) but comments from Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted as dovish by the market. The Fed said the US economy was enjoying “modest growth” and “robust” job gains, with policymakers still “highly attentive to inflation risks” as it seeks to tighten financial conditions and rein in high prices. Markets have been pricing in the possibility of a rate cut by the Fed in the back half of the year. On Wall Street, US stocks were choppy after the Fed announcement but began to rally after Powell acknowledged inflation was starting to ease and the disinflationary process was at an early stage. “The market’s reaction implies investors feel we are much closer to the end than we are, let’s say, to the middle of the rate tightening cycle,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York. “You certainly need disinflation in order to get down to your inflationary target and even though he did say multiple times that we are not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to bring inflation back down to 2%, the other statements implied that we are getting pretty close.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.92 points, or 0.02%, to 34,092.96, the S&P 500 gained 42.61 points, or 1.05%, to 4,119.21, and the Nasdaq Composite added 231.77 points, or 2%, to 11,816.32. The gains sent the S&P 500 to its highest close since August 25. Before the policy announcement, economic data painted a mixed picture, with a labor market that remains strong while manufacturing activity continues to weaken, showing contraction for a third straight month. Investors have viewed a weaker labor market as a key component to bring down stubbornly high inflation. Earnings season with earnings from names such as Apple and Amazon are due on Thursday, February 2. Early gains for European shares faded to close virtually unchanged ahead of the Fed statement, although industrial stocks, up 0.85%, were a bright spot. On the heels of the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England will make their policy statements on Thursday, in which each is largely expected to hike by 50 bps. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.03% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.08%. MSCI’s index hit its highest intraday level since August 17 and was poised for its biggest one-day percentage gain since January 20. Data on Wednesday showed headline inflation in the eurozone moderated to 8.5% in January, from 9% in December, while core prices picked up to 7% from 6.9%, likely keeping pressure on the ECB to raise interest rates aggressively. The dollar started February on a lower note, continuing its weakening trajectory of the previous four months, losing further ground after Powell’s comments, hitting its lowest level since late April. The dollar index fell 0.901%, with the euro up 1.11% to $1.0983. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.83% versus the greenback at 129.02 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2371, up 0.41% on the day. US Treasury yields initially moved up after the statement but reversed course and mostly fell after Powell’s comments were still lower on the day, as benchmark 10-year notes were down 10.5 basis points to 3.424%, from 3.529% late on Tuesday, January 31, although the two-year yield briefly turned higher after the most recent batch of economic data. Despite the drop in the dollar, US crude settled down 3.12% to $$76.41 per barrel and Brent settled at $82.84, 3.07% lower on the day after US government data showed big builds in inventories while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies kept to their output policy. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/former-wagner-commander-medvedev-apology-fighting-in-ukraine/,[],"OSLO, Norway – A former commander of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group who fled to Norway told Reuters he wanted to apologize for fighting in Ukraine and was speaking out to bring the perpetrators of atrocities in the conflict to justice. Andrei Medvedev, who crossed the Russian-Norwegian border on January 13, says he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for Wagner. Medvedev said he fled over the Arctic border, climbing through barbed-wire fences and evading a border patrol with dogs, hearing guards firing shots as he ran through a forest and over the frozen river that separates the two countries. The 26-year-old is now seeking asylum in Norway. “Many consider me to be a scoundrel, a criminal, a murderer,” Medvedev said in an interview. “First of all, repeatedly, and again, I would like to apologize, and although I don’t know how it would be received, I want to say I’m sorry. “I want to explain that I am not that person. Yes, I served in Wagner. There are some moments (in my story) that people don’t like, that I joined them at all, but nobody is born smart.” Appearing relaxed and confident, Medvedev said he wanted to speak out about his experiences in the war so “the perpetrators are punished” for their crimes in Ukraine. “I have decided to stand against it publicly, to help to ensure that perpetrators are punished in certain cases, and I will try to make my contribution, at least a small bit.” Wagner has been locked in a bloody battle of attrition in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. A special report published by Reuters last week found a graveyard in southern Russia buried with men who were convicts who had been recruited by Wagner to fight in Ukraine. Kripos, Norway’s national criminal police service, which has responsibility for investigating war crimes, has begun questioning Medvedev about his experiences in Ukraine. He has a status as a witness. Reuters was not immediately able to verify his claims. Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has previously said that Medvedev had worked in a Norwegian unit of Wagner and had “mistreated prisoners”. “Be careful, he’s very dangerous,” Prigozhin said. Wagner did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Wednesday. Medvedev was born in the region of Tomsk in Siberia. He said he was placed in an orphanage when he was around age 12, after the death of his mother and the disappearance of his father. He said he was drafted in the Russian military in 2014, aged 18, and served with the Ulyanovsk-based 31st Airborne Brigade. “That was my first deployment in Donbas,” Medvedev added, declining to give more details. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, while Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas – comprised of Donetsk and Luhansk – sought to break away from Kyiv’s control. Medvedev said he had served several jail terms, including one for a robbery, and when he came out of prison the last time, he decided to join the Wagner group, in July 2022. Medvedev said he hadn’t been recruited straight out of the prison, but decided to join because he realised he would likely be mobilised in the regular Russian armed forces anyway. He signed a four-month contract for a monthly salary of some 250,000 roubles ($3,575). He crossed into Ukraine on July 16, he said, and fought near Bakhmut. “It was fucked up. The roads to Artemovsk were littered with the corpses of our soldiers,” he said, using the Russian place name for Bakhmut. “The losses were heavy…. I saw many friends die.” At Wagner, Medvedev led a squad, taking orders from a platoon commander and planning combat missions. He said he saw “acts of courage from both sides”. Medvedev said he witnessed two people who did not want to fight being shot in front of freshly recruited prisoners. “The scariest thing? To realize that there are people who consider themselves to be your compatriots, and who could come and kill you in an instant, or on someone’s orders,” he said. “Your own people. That probably was the scariest thing.” Medvedev left Wagner at the end of his four-month contract, even though his superiors told him he had to serve longer, he said. Asked whether he wasn’t afraid to be shot for refusing to fight, Medvedev said: “They somehow forgot to install in me the self-preservation instinct when I was growing up in an orphanage. So not really.” – Rappler.com ($1 = 69.9305 roubles)"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/sulu-sea-black-market-green-sea-turtle-trade-sparks-outrage-barmm/,[],"COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Bangsamoro region officials on Wednesday, February 1, sounded alarm bells over the black market trade of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Sulu Sea. The warning came even as authorities pointed to the killing of 15 green sea turtles that infuriated officials of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The endangered turtles, caught in the Sulu Sea, were allegedly to be sold to foreign buyers. The green sea turtle, a species of marine turtle found in warm and tropical waters, has been declared endangered as a result of hunting and loss of habitat, among other factors. Rosslaini Alonto-Sinarimbo, the director-general of the BARMM Ministry of Trade, Investments, and Tourism (MTIT), said the apprehension of a group of villagers in Sulu in late January highlighted the illegal practices of locals who were enticed by the promise of making quick profits. Sinarimbo said the MTIT and other concerned BARMM offices would take immediate action to stop the illegal trade. “These locals believe they could earn big time from illegal catching and killing of our sea turtles. They do not know that protecting the turtles would bring in more tourism money to their villages. Tourists would want to see these gentle sea creatures,” Sinarimbo said. She said the BARMM Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENRE), Ministry of the Interior and Local Government (MILG), local governments, MTIT, and environmental advocates were collaborating for a public awareness campaign for the protection of the endangered species. The Maritime police arrested eight men from Pangutaran for illegal possession of 15 dead green sea turtles during a raid in Sitio Puh Higad, Barangay Bubuan in Hadji Panglima Tahil town in Sulu on January 22. The suspects were identified as the following: Police also seized five motorized boats loaded with 15 dead green sea turtles. Authorities said the turtles were allegedly about to be sold on the black market to Chinese buyers. The incident also alarmed the region’s officials because the Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary, a major nesting ground for the endangered species, is close to the area where the turtles were caught. The sanctuary, part of Tawi-Tawi, is bounded by the Sulu and Mindanao seas in the western and northern portions and by the Celebes Sea on the eastern and southern tip. It was established as a protected area in 1999. The suspects are facing charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act and the law against catching rare, threatened, or endangered species. Based on RA 9147, the penalty for hunting and trading wildlife ranges from two to four years of imprisonment and/or a fine of P30,000 to P300,000 for hunting, and P5,000 to P300,000 for trading. “People in the area need to understand the value of sea turtles,” Sinarimbo said. BARMM Environment Minister Akmad Brahim blamed the flourishing illegal trade on the lack of awareness among people about environmental protection. Brahim said the region’s environment ministry would step up operations to thwart such illegal activities especially in areas where fishing has been strictly regulated or restricted. “We are closely coordinating with local officials and are glad our local residents are cooperating,” he said. Brahim said the sanctuary areas for sea turtles and other endangered species need to have more security. In the Bangsamoro parliament in Cotabato City, climate change and environmental protection advocate Baileng Utto-Mantawil proposed a law to strengthen multi-agency efforts on education and information dissemination for the protection and preservation of marine wildlife. If approved, the local governments, MILG, MENRE, and the Fisheries Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform (MAFAR) would be tasked to work together in carrying out the campaign. “We must collaborate our efforts to take care of our island provinces, the forefront of tourism and investment opportunities, and our wildlife in the ocean,” Mantawil said. The area where the sea turtles were caught is close to a group of islands in the Sulu Archipelago which is a major nesting ground for the endangered green sea turtles in Southeast Asia. Each year, more than 2,000 turtles make their way to the sanctuary to lay their eggs, but only a small percentage reach adulthood due to natural predators. Aggravating this are the poachers. The 242,967-hectare sanctuary covers the islands of Baguan, Taganak, Boan, Great Bakkungan, Langaan, and Lihiman, and their surrounding waters. The Philippines is also working with Indonesia and Malaysia to protect marine turtles in the region. In 2001, the three countries signed an agreement on the conservation and management of marine turtles along their borders. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-federal-reserve-monetary-policy-interest-rates-february-2023/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, February 1, it had turned a key corner in the fight against high inflation, but that “victory” would still require its benchmark overnight interest rate to be increased further and remain elevated at least through 2023. In announcing its latest policy decision, the US central bank scaled back to a quarter-percentage-point rate increase after a year of larger hikes and swept aside in its statement the long list of reasons, from war to the pandemic, that were driving prices higher to say simply that “inflation has eased.” Yet policymakers also projected “ongoing increases” in borrowing costs would be needed, a still open-ended commitment that did not yet pinpoint when the rate hikes might stop, and pushed back against an expectation in financial markets that the Fed would pause soon and, indeed, cut rates later this year. Investors nevertheless took a dovish cue from remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who referred repeatedly during a news conference to the “disinflationary” process that now appeared to be underway. Equity markets rose as Powell spoke and investors slightly boosted bets for coming rate cuts. Meanwhile, Powell insisted that rate cuts are not in the offing, and took pains to walk what has become an increasingly fine line between the flow of data showing inflation in steady decline with the need to keep the public and investors attuned to the fact that interest rates will continue rising. “We can now say for the first time that the disinflationary process has started,” Powell told reporters after the end of the Fed’s latest two-day policy meeting, with goods prices slowing, pandemic-related shortages easing, and supply chains getting back to normal. “This is a good thing.” From a peak of nearly 7% in June, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation was 5% in December, still well above its 2% target but heading steadily in the right direction. Yet “it’s just the early stages,” Powell said. “We’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and…sending signals that we think that the game is won, because we’ve got a long way to go.” Important segments of the economy, including broad swaths of the service sector, have yet to see inflation slow, the Fed chief said, while a high level of job openings and still-strong wage increases showed the labor market was “extremely tight.” “The labor market continues to be out of balance,” Powell said, flagging the fact that Fed officials feel it is likely that the unemployment rate will need to rise from its current low level of 3.5% for inflation to complete the journey back to the 2% level. The Fed’s statement on Wednesday marked its first explicit acknowledgment of slowing inflation after a year in which prices accelerated much faster than anticipated – requiring a series of rapid three-quarters-of-a-percentage point and half-percentage-point rate increases to match the outbreak of rising prices. Dynamics that the Fed during the past year has said were driving prices higher, including the pandemic, were either dropped from the statement altogether or, in the case of the war in Ukraine, cited only as a source of “global uncertainty” rather than inflation. The rate hikes imposed by the Fed since March have now totaled 4.5 percentage points, with the policy rate now in a range between 4.50% and 4.75%, the highest since 2007. That is reflected in an array of consumer borrowing costs from home mortgages to car loans. The full impact of that monetary policy tightening has yet to be felt in the economy, but has so far been absorbed without derailing the “modest” economic growth and “robust” job gains that the Fed cited in its latest statement. It is in part that resilience that has the central bank poised for “ongoing increases” in its policy interest rate. With inflation still high and demand in the economy stronger than many anticipated, Powell said it remains unclear just how much higher rates will need to go. As of December, Fed policymakers projected a peak policy rate in a range between 5% and 5.25%, consistent with what Powell said, as an aside during his news conference, were likely a “couple” more rate hikes to come. Stocks, modestly lower ahead of the Fed rate decision, turned sharply higher as Powell spoke. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day with just over a 1% gain. At the same time, the yield on the 2-year Treasury note, the maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, dropped abruptly and traded down more than 10 basis points at 4.10%. The U.S. dollar slid against a basket of major trading partner currencies. “If you were hoping for clear signs of an upcoming pause in interest rate hikes, you were left wanting. The Federal Reserve retained the phrase ‘ongoing increases’ in their statement, leaving their options open depending on what upcoming economic data says,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. The Fed statement indicated that any future rate increases would be in quarter-percentage-point increments, dropping a reference to the “pace” of future increases and instead referring to the “extent” of rate changes. Fed policymakers hope the central bank can continue nudging inflation lower without triggering a deep recession or causing a substantial rise in unemployment. The Fed did not issue new economic projections from its policymakers on Wednesday, but did reaffirm its commitment to its 2% average inflation target as part of its annual review of operating principles. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/chatgpt-record-fastest-growing-user-base/,[],"ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI, is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to a UBS study on Wednesday, February 1. The report, citing data from analytics firm Similar Web, said about 13 million unique visitors used ChatGPT per day in January, more than double the levels in December. “In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,” UBS analysts wrote in the note. Similar Web did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the figures. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft, launched ChatGPT in late November. It took TikTok about nine months after its global launch to add 100 million users and it took Instagram 2-1/2 years, according to data from Sensor Tower. ChatGPT is currently free to use. The company on Thursday launched a $20 a month subscription that provides more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first. Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while adding up to a substantial amount of computing cost, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot’s responses. The tool has also raised questions about academic dishonesty and misinformation. Last month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and cloud credit. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-job-openings-labor-turnover-survey-december-2022/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – US job openings unexpectedly rose in December, showing demand for labor remains strong despite higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession, which could keep the Federal Reserve on its policy tightening path. There were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in December, the Department of Labor’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed on Wednesday, February 1. Signs of persistent labor tightness did not discourage the US central bank from raising its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, further slowing the pace of the Fed’s rate hikes. The Fed promised “ongoing increases” in borrowing costs. “This could well be the first recession in history without material job losses,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. “It’s a good thing for the Fed that inflation pressures are cooling because the labor market isn’t cooling at all.” Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 572,000 to a five-month high of 11.0 million on the last day of December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.250 million job openings. With vacancies concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry as well as retail trade, some economists believed December’s surge was temporary. Others speculated that job openings had been overstated because of difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. “The leisure and hospitality sector accounted for three-quarters of the total increase, rising to its highest level since December of 2021 – a month which was followed by a sharp decline in January 2022 – a pattern we expect to emerge in next month’s report,” said Matthew Martin, a US economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “A jump in job openings in the retail sector is also at odds with a lower pace of seasonal hiring around the holidays.” There were an additional 409,000 unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services industry. Employment in the industry remains below its pre-pandemic level. Retail trade reported 134,000 more vacancies. Construction, which has been hammered by higher borrowing costs, had 82,000 more openings. The job openings rate up shot to 6.7% from 6.4% in November. Hiring increased to 6.2 million from 6.0 million in the prior month. The hires rate rose to 4% from 3.9% in November. With hiring lagging, wage growth could remain elevated, though it cooled in the fourth quarter. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices rose. The Fed has since last March raised its policy rate by 450 bps from near-zero to a 4.50% and 4.75% range. The fastest monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s has left economists expecting a recession by the second half of the year. The housing market is depressed and the downturn in manufacturing is intensifying. A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed its manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 47.4 in January from 48.4 in December. The third straight monthly contraction pushed the index to the lowest level since May 2020 and below the 48.7 mark viewed as consistent with a recession in the broader economy. Only one of the six largest manufacturing industries, transportation equipment, reported growth. Comments from manufacturers were mixed, with some describing business as “still strong,” while others said “sales have dropped.” Despite the deterioration in conditions, factories did not appear to be laying off workers in large numbers. According to the ISM, companies “are indicating that they are not going to substantially reduce head counts as they are positive about the second half of the year.” That was reinforced by the JOLTS report, which showed layoffs climbing to 1.5 million in December from 1.4 million in November. The layoffs rate edged up to 1% from 0.9% in prior month. Workers also continued to voluntarily quit their jobs in December. The quits rate, which is viewed as a measure of labor market confidence, was unchanged at 2.7%. A third report showed private employment increased by 106,000 jobs last month after rising by 253,000 in December, well below economists’ expectations for a gain of 178,000. The ADP National Employment report, however, attributed the weaker-than-expected private payrolls gain to bad weather in mid-January, including flooding in California. Leisure/hospitality employment increased by 95,000 jobs last month, which economists said was at odds with bad weather holding back hiring. The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the release on Friday, February 3, of the Department of Labor’s more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for January. ADP has been an unreliable predictor of private payrolls in the Department of Labor employment report. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in January after rising by 223,000 in December. Economists at Goldman Sachs said they did not expect a significant drag from winter weather or the California flooding in January’s employment report. “We caution against extrapolating,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. “Overall, the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data show the economy continues to create jobs at a strong pace, and the labor market is showing only gradual signs of softening despite a rapid increase in interest rates.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/rodrigo-duterte-reward-leads-vice-mayor-hit-run-truck/,[],"DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – A P500,000-reward offered by former president Rodrigo Duterte in exchange for information about a hit-and-run case in Davao City led to a pick-up truck of a vice mayor in Davao Oriental. On Tuesday night, January 31, Vice Mayor John Paul Lampig of Boston town, Davao Oriental surrendered his driver, Jester Yucosing, to the Davao City police. The town vice mayor said the vehicle, a white Toyota Hilux-Conquest with MV-File no. 1101-102646, was registered under his name. Lampig’s move came as a witness came forward and provided authorities with information about the vehicle’s number, and to collect the reward, police said. On January 29, Duterte announced he would reward anyone with information that would lead to the identification of the vehicle that killed Anna Mae Talili in an accident along MacArthur Highway in Matina, Davao City, on January 26. Talili was a 21-year-old student who worked as a cashier at Davao City’s Matina Town Square. Talili and her boyfriend were riding a motorcycle in tandem when Lampig’s vehicle hit them by accident. Police said Talili’s companion also suffered serious injuries, and is receiving treatment in a hospital in Davao City. Davao regional police spokesperson Major Eudisan Gultiano said Lampig was not in the vehicle at the time of the accident. “The vice mayor is not involved in it. We have already validated that. The vice mayor told us that his personal driver has a serious illness,” Gultiano said. Police, however, said they have questions about why it took days before Yucosing surrendered. Gultiano said Duterte’s reward offer helped in identifying the  vehicle and the surrender of the driver. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/global-purchasing-managers-index-manufacturing-january-2023/,[],"Manufacturing activity across the United States, Europe, and Asia contracted again last month, underscoring the fragility of the global economic recovery, although factories in the eurozone at least may have passed the trough, surveys showed on Wednesday, February 1. The latest figures come as central bankers gear up for another round of interest rate increases to combat high inflation. The US Federal Reserve hiked borrowing costs by 25 basis points on Wednesday while the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are both expected to add 50 bps on Thursday, February 2. The Fed’s fastest interest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s has stifled demand for goods, which are mostly bought on credit. US manufacturing sunk further in January with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reporting its manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) dropped to 47.4 from 48.4 in December. The third straight monthly contraction pushed the index to the lowest level since May 2020 and below the 48.7 mark viewed as consistent with a recession in the broader economy. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the US economy. The dollar’s past appreciation against the currencies of the United States’ main trade partners and a softening in global demand are also hurting manufacturing in the world’s largest economy. “It looks like we will continue to see headline contraction in the manufacturing sector for several more months, at a minimum,” said economists at Jefferies in a note to clients following the survey’s release. But the combination of better supply and ebbing demand has resulted in a significant slowdown in consumer and wholesale inflation, with outright declines in monthly goods prices. Despite demand being under pressure, US factories are also holding onto their workers, for now. The ISM survey’s measure of factory employment dipped marginally to 50.6 from 50.8 in December. Elsewhere, price pressures slackened and a fall in demand moderated in the 20 countries sharing the euro, driving a surge in optimism. The eurozone eked out growth in the final three months of 2022, managing to avoid a recession, official data showed on Tuesday, January 31. S&P Global’s eurozone final manufacturing PMI climbed to a five-month high of 48.8 in January from December’s 47.8, in line with a preliminary reading but still below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. “We think in general the worst is now past for both inflation and the activity front. The activity is not softening, it is going back up, so expectations are for a rebound,” said Mateusz Urban, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. Manufacturers in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, started 2023 with a slightly brighter outlook on the year ahead despite demand continuing to fall as inflation and supply chain problems eased. In France, the bloc’s second biggest economy, factory activity returned to growth albeit not as strongly as initially forecast. But British manufacturing business shrank for a sixth month in a row in January, kicking off a tough 2023 when the country’s economy looks set to fall into a recession. Easing price pressures will however be welcomed by central bank policymakers. Soaring inflation – initially described as transient – has proved far more sticky than thought and prompted aggressive monetary tightening. Eurozone inflation eased for the third straight month in January but relief may be limited as underlying price growth held steady, official data showed on Wednesday. In Asia, factory activity contracted in January as the boost from China’s COVID reopening had yet to take full effect. China’s factory activity shrank more slowly in January after Beijing lifted tough COVID curbs late last year, a private sector survey showed. China’s Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing (PMI) nudged up to 49.2 in January from 49.0 in December, staying below the 50 mark for a sixth straight month. The data contrasted with a better-than-expected official PMI survey issued on Tuesday. But whereas the official PMI largely focuses on big and state-owned Chinese businesses, the Caixin survey centers on small firms and coastal regions. Softening input-price pressures also offered initial positive signs for Asia, with the pace of contraction in output slowing in Japan and South Korea, the surveys showed. But there is uncertainty about whether the region can weather the hit from slowing global demand and stubbornly high inflation. “The worst of Asia’s downturn is behind, but the outlook is clouded by weaknesses in major export destinations like the United States and Europe,” said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. Factory activity expanded in January in Indonesia and the Philippines but shrank in Malaysia and Taiwan, PMI surveys showed. India’s manufacturing industry started the year on a weaker note, expanding at the slowest pace in three months. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday slightly raised its 2023 global growth outlook on “surprisingly resilient” demand in the United States and Europe and the reopening of China’s economy after Beijing abandoned its strict pandemic controls. But the IMF said global growth would still slow to 2.9% in 2023 from 3.4% in 2022, and it warned the world could easily tip into recession. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/class-work-suspensions-davao-provinces-after-earthquake-february-2-2023/,[],"DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – The ground shook with ferocity as a magnitude 6 earthquake struck parts of Mindanao on Wednesday night, February 1, leaving a trail of damage and sending people to panic, especially in the Davao Region. In response, the provincial governments of Davao de Oro and Davao del Norte called off classes in schools and office work in local governments on Thursday, February 2. Residents in the coastal towns of Maco and Mabini in Davao de Oro fled their villages for fear of a tsunami after the earthquake, but officials have since assured the public that there was no tsunami advisory and that the origin of the quake was on land, not at sea. The suspension of classes and work in the two Davao provinces  would allow inspection teams to determine if the earthquake caused any damage to school facilities and government buildings. Davao de Oro Governor Dorothy Gonzaga declared the class and work suspension in the province. In Davao del Norte, Governor Edwin Jubahib also issued a memorandum order declaring the suspension of all classes in public and private schools. Officials in the adjacent eastern seaboard province of Davao Oriental said they were assessing the extent of the damage the earthquake caused, said Governor Corazon Malanyaon. In hard-hit Davao de Oro, the earthquake was felt at Intensity IV to Intensity V, especially in New Bataan, a first-class municipality with a population of over 51,000. Its effects were strong enough to send people outdoors. Students and teachers fled classrooms and medical workers brought patients to open spaces, outside of a hospital. The earthquake caused damage to homes and establishments. Photos and videos of objects shaking and fallen merchandise went viral on social media. In a statement, the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Maco town in Davao de Oro said the seawater receded, but eventually went back to its normal level. The earthquake registered at Intensity III in Davao City and Intensity V in Nabunturan, Davao de Oro. It was felt in other cities across Mindanao, including Kidapawan City, Sarangani, Bislig City, and Cagayan de Oro, among others. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) initially reported that the epicenter was located in New Bataan town in Davao de Oro with a depth of 11 kilometers. Angie dela Cruz, the spokesperson of the Office of Civil Defense in the Davao Region, said many people panicked because of the tsunami scare aggravated by false information on social media. She said it was challenging to local officials to assure people that a tsunami was unlikely. Dela Cruz said there was no government tsunami advisory because the earthquake was a result of a land-based tremor, not a sea-based one. “Let us all come together to ease the fears and panic among our community, as spreading misinformation only causes harm,” she appealed. – Rappler.com"

Singer Kate Bush, heavy metal band Iron Maiden, rock band Rage Against the Machine, rock group Soundgarden, R&B vocal group The Spinners and hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest are returning nominees. “These artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps,” said John Sykes, chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. To be eligible for nomination, artists or bands must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years prior to the year of nomination. This year is the first year of eligibility for Elliott and The White Stripes. Last year, the Hall of Fame inducted rapper Eminem, new wave band Duran Duran, country music legend Dolly Parton, rocker Pat Benatar, pop group Eurythmics and singers Lionel Ritchie and Carly Simon. Parton had initially said she wanted to bow out because she did not feel she had earned a rock-and-roll honor, but then changed her stance and joined other former inductees from the country music world, Hank Williams and Johnny Cash.

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-february-2-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged EU leaders during talks in Kyiv on Thursday, February 2, to slap more sanctions on Russia, as Moscow’s forces pressed their offensive in eastern Ukraine and fired missiles into the city of Kramatorsk near the front line. One missile destroyed an apartment building late on Wednesday in Kramatorsk, killing at least three people and wounding 18, police said, while Russia said on Thursday it had struck US-made rocket launchers in the area. The head of the European Commission pledged more EU aid for Ukraine as she arrived in Kyiv by train along with more than a dozen other senior EU officials for two days of talks seen as key to Ukraine’s hopes of one day joining the bloc. “Russia is paying a heavy price (for the war) as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation. We will keep turning up the pressure further,” Ursula von der Leyen later told a joint news conference with Zelenskiy. The West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year, aiming to cripple its ability to wage a war that has devastated Ukrainian cities and towns, killed tens of thousands of people and forced millions to flee their homes. Zelenskiy called for more sanctions, saying the pace had “slightly slowed” of late and that Moscow was adapting to them. “This is a joint European task to reduce Russia’s ability to evade sanctions. And the faster and better this task is accomplished, the closer we will be to defeating the aggression of the Russian Federation,” he said. Von der Leyen said the EU would have a new package of sanctions in place for the first anniversary of the war, the biggest armed conflict in Europe since World War Two. But she avoided any commitment to fast-track Ukraine’s EU membership bid, which is expected to take years. The team from Brussels will discuss sending more arms and money to Ukraine, increasing access for Ukrainian products to the EU, helping Kyiv cover energy needs, strengthening sanctions on Russia and prosecuting Russian leaders for the war. Earlier, Zelenskiy gave another bleak assessment of the battlefield situation in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have been making incremental gains as the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion looms. In Kramatorsk, a Russian Iskander-K tactical missile struck at 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) on Wednesday, police said. “At least eight apartment buildings were damaged. One of them was completely destroyed,” they said in a Facebook post. “People may remain under the rubble.” In its daily update, Russia’s defense ministry said on Thursday it had destroyed US-made HIMARS and MLRS launch pads in an attack “in the region of Kramatorsk”. It made no reference to the strike on the residential building. Kramatorsk is about 55 km (34 miles) northwest of Bakhmut, currently the main focus of fighting in eastern Ukraine. Russia, determined to make progress before Ukraine receives newly promised Western battle tanks and armoured vehicles, has picked up momentum on the battlefield and it announced advances north and south of Bakhmut, which has suffered persistent Russian bombardment for months. “The enemy is trying to achieve at least something now to show that Russia has some chances on the anniversary of the invasion,” Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Wednesday. Bakhmut and 10 towns and villages around it came under further Russian fire, the Ukrainian military said. Russian forces are pushing from both the north and south to encircle Bakhmut, using superior troop numbers to try to cut it off from re-supply and force the Ukrainians out, Ukrainian military analyst Yevhen Dikiy said. “The enemy is able to use its sole resource, which it has in excess – its men,” Dikiy told Espreso TV, describing a landscape to the northeast of Bakhmut “literally covered with corpses”. Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow has taken huge losses around Bakhmut, sending in waves of poorly equipped troops, including thousands of convicts recruited from prisons as mercenaries. A former commander of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group who fled to Norway in January told Reuters he wanted to apologise for fighting in Ukraine and was speaking out to bring perpetrators of atrocities to justice. “First of all, repeatedly, and again, I would like to apologise,” said 26-year-old Andrei Medvedev. Ukraine has secured pledges of weapons from the West offering new capabilities – the latest expected this week to include rockets from the United States that would nearly double the range of Ukrainian forces. “We’re focused on providing Ukraine the capability that it needs to be effective in its upcoming anticipated counter- offensive in the spring,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a visit to the Philippines on Thursday. The new weaponry would put all of Russia’s supply lines in eastern Ukraine, as well as parts of Crimea, seized from Ukraine and annexed by Russia in 2014, within range of Ukrainian forces. Moscow says such rockets will escalate the conflict but not change its course. “The greater the range of the weapons supplied to the Kyiv regime the more we will have to push them back from territories which are part of our country,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state TV on Thursday. Moscow claims to have annexed four Ukrainian provinces last year, in addition to Crimea.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-s23-smartphones-specs-pricing-availability/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Samsung on Thursday, February 2, Philippine time pulled the wrappings back on the Galaxy S23 smartphone line at its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2023. The Galaxy S23 line, like last year’s S22, consists of three models: the standard S23, the slightly larger S23+, and the top-of-the-line S23 Ultra, all of which feature annual iterative upgrades across different departments. A lot of the major changes, however, are exclusive to the most expensive model, the S23 Ultra. Chief of which is the inclusion of Samsung’s new 200-megapixel wide camera sensor, which is close to double that of the S22 Ultra’s 108-megapixel sensor. While megapixel count isn’t everything, the more you have, the higher the resolution of your photos, meaning more detail. The S23 Ultra also includes a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor, a 10-megapixel telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom, and a 10-megapixel telephoto sensor with 10x optical zoom, alongside the 200-megapixel primary sensor. It’ll also come with a 12-megapixel front camera. Meanwhile, the S23 and S23+ both have a triple-camera system that consists of a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor, and a 10-megapixel telephoto sensor, as well as a 12-megapixel front camera. When it comes to the design, the S23 Ultra is once again the odd one out, with it featuring squared edges for a look that’s similar to last year’s S22 Ultra and reminiscent of the now-defunct Note line. It even includes an S Pen stylus out of the box. The S23 and S23+, on the other hand, have rounded edges for a curvier look. But what the three appear to have in common is that they all drop the camera bump, with the sensors now sitting directly on the rear panel itself. For display, there’s no notable difference between the sizes of the S23 models from their S22 counterparts. The standard S23 features a 6.1-inch display, while the S23+ features a 6.6-inch display. Both of which are 1080p OLED panels with 120Hz refresh rate. The higher-end S23 Ultra flaunts a larger 6.8-inch OLED panel with a 1440p resolution instead of 1080p. Under the hood, the new Galaxy line is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. The S23 Ultra packs 12GB of RAM, and internal storage from 256 GB up to 1 TB. Its two siblings, meanwhile, only ship with 8GB of RAM, and caps storage at 512GB for the S23+ and 256GB for the standard S23. The S23 has a battery capacity of 3,900mAh, a slight upgrade from the 3,700mAh of the S22. The S23+ has a battery capacity of 4,700mAh, while the S23 Ultra has 5,000mAh. The two more expensive models support up to 45W fast charging, while the base model tops out at 25W. All three models support fast wireless charging 2.0 as well as wireless powershare. The Galaxy S23 series comes in will come in four colors: Phantom Black, Cream, Green, and Lavender. The Galaxy S23 retails for P53,990 for the 128GB variant, and P57,990 for the 256GB variant. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23+ starts at P68,990 for 256GB variant, and P76,990 for the 512GB variant.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/dubai-basketball-championship-strong-group-philippines-dynamo-lebanon-february-1-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Dynamo Lebanon proved to be a worthy title contender at the 32nd Dubai International Basketball Championship after handing stacked Strong Group Philippines its first loss off a late 89-83 pullaway to stay unbeaten on Wednesday, February 1 (Thursday, February 2, Manila time). Shabazz Muhammad led Strong Group in scoring for the fourth straight game off a 25-point, 9-rebound outing. However, he was ultimately overshadowed by Lebanon import Cleanthony Early’s timely 29-point eruption off the bench, highlighted by a huge dagger triple with 48.3 seconds to play for the 86-81 separation. Filipino collegiate star JD Cagulangan tried to recreate his clutch shot-making that launched him to folk hero status in UP, but both his three-point attempts in the final minute clanked off as Zach Lofton put the finishing touches from the line, 88-81, with 26.9 ticks left to play. Fil-Am Sedrick Barefield coasted to an easy layup to cap off a 9-point night before Robert split his charity trip at the 13.9-second mark to set the final score. All in all, Lebanon rallied from a 78-81 deficit with a pivotal 11-2 charge to the finish line that stunned the Filipino fans in attendance at the Al Nasr Club. Lofton backed up Early’s scoring eruption with 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting, while Thomas Ibrahima scored 16 on a 5-of-11 clip. Meanwhile, Adamson star guard Jerom Lastimosa saw his tournament-best 14-point outing on 6-of-9 shooting go to waste. Strong Group’s top recruit Nick Young returned from a one-game absence with 11 points in 13 minutes before checking out with more than five minutes left to play, while Renaldo Balkman dropped a quiet 10-point, 9-rebound line in 28 minutes. Both imports are nursing their own injuries. Despite the loss, the Philippine team will comfortably enter the knockout playoffs alongside Lebanon since eight of the nine invited teams are set to advance. The first of four quarterfinal matches will begin on Thursday, February 2, 11 pm (Manila time), while the last will tip off on Saturday, February 4, 1 am (Manila time). Strong Group will next face the mighty Al Riyadi Beirut led by Lebanese sensation Wael Arakji on Friday, February 3, 1 am (Manila time).

https://www.rappler.com/nation/names-facts-pnp-body-review-records-erring-cops/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Almost a month since Interior chief Benhur Abalos asked Philippine National Police (PNP) generals and colonels to resign in a bid to address the drug problem hounding the national police, his agency unveiled on Wednesday, February 1, the five-man committee that would review the cops’ records. Besides reviewing the records of all high-ranking officers, the courtesy resignations of those with proven links to illegal drug trade will also be accepted by the special body. Below are the names of the committee members and important facts about them: Benjamin Magalong, a retired PNP general, was among the first named members of the five-man committee named by Abalos. Widely respected by his colleagues, he is a member of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Sandigan Class of 1982. Magalong is currently the mayor of Baguio City, in his home region, the Cordilleras. After completing his studies at the academy, he was deployed to his home region and joined the Special Action Force (SAF). While in SAF, he founded the SAF’s Seaborne and Sniper Unit. He also led the SAF’s operation to quell Abu Sayyaf prisoners during the Bicutan siege. During former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s presidency, Magalong was detained for allegedly leading a SAF unit during an alleged coup attempt against Arroyo. The rebellion charge against him was later dismissed. He also joined the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Afterwards, Magalong returned to the PNP and was assigned to the Quezon City Police Department, where he got his first star. He later headed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, as well as the PNP’s Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management. Before becoming Baguio City mayor, Magalong was first known as the police general who led the probe into the Mamasapano clash, where 44 SAF members died. Then-PNP’s Board of Inquiry (BOI) and Magalong tagged late former president Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III in the mishandled police operation. Then-presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda hit Magalong for failing to interview Aquino, while then-justice secretary Leila de Lima also slammed the report, saying it misconstrued the PNP’s chain of command and the chief executive’s place in it. Under the former president Rodrigo Duterte’s administration, Magalong headed the team that reviewed the PNP’s operations in the bloody drug war. Because of how he managed his city at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Magalong was also named by Duterte as the contact tracing czar. Magalong is not the only retired general in the committee. Isagani Nerez, Undersecretary for Police Affairs at the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Military Affairs, has also been named as part of the review body. Nerez is a retired PNP general and a member of the PMA Maharlika Class of 1984. A lawyer, he worked in various PNP units such as Police Anti-Crime Emergency Response, SAF, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, and the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group, according to a Philippine News Agency report. He once served as the Director for Integrated Police Operations for Eastern Mindanao. During his stint at the national police, he headed the team that probed the Kidapawan dispersal, where two people died, and 100 cops and protesters were injured. Like Magalong, Nerez has ties with the North after serving as Baguio City police chief during the mid-2000s. He later became the chief of Cordillera regional police. Gilberto Eduardo “Gibo” Teodoro Jr. served as the secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND) under Arroyo. He ran for president in the 2010 elections, but lost to his cousin, Noynoy Aquino. Teodoro also served for three terms as representative of Tarlac’s 1st District, from 1997 to 2007. Duterte offered the DND chief post to him twice, but he declined. In 2021, a year before the 2022 presidential election, Teodoro offered to be the running mate of now Vice President Sara Duterte. He ran during the 2022 senatorial race and placed 15th – only three spots away from the Senate’s “magic 12.” During Abalos’ press briefing on Wednesday, the current PNP chief, Police General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. was announced as a member of the special body. Azurin was among the first top PNP officers who tendered their courtesy resignations shortly after Abalos made the appeal. Although Azurin had tendered his courtesy resignation, he remained the country’s top cop because his submission only takes effect if it is accepted by his superiors. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. did not accept Azurin’s resignation, according to Abalos. The interior chief added that Azurin had already been screened before he was chosen to be part of the committee. Azurin, an Ilocano, is Marcos’ first national police chief, and the 28th PNP chief since 1991. In his first speech as PNP chief, Azurin said he will enforce his “Malasakit + Kaayusan + Kapayapaan = Kaunlaran” (Compassion + Order + Peace = Progress) mandate in overseeing the national police. He said he will also review how the bloody drug war was carried out. The current PNP chief is a member of PMA Makatao Class of 1989. Azurin previously served as the director of Benguet provincial police, headed the Chief Task Force Limbas of the Highway Patrol Group, and was the deputy operations officer of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force. As a one star general, Azurin headed the PNP Maritime Group, and later the Ilocos Region police. He also held key positions in Camp Crame – the PNP’s national headquarters – such as head of the Directorate for Comptrollership and of the Directorate for Information and Communication Technology Management. Azurin will serve until his retirement on April 24, 2023, when he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 56. The identity of the five-man committee’s last member will remain a secret, according to Abalos. The fifth member cited “family concerns” in concealing his/her identity for now. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/june-mar-fajardo-keeps-in-touch-leo-austria-despite-coaching-change/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The bond between June Mar Fajardo and Leo Austria remains tight even as the champion mentor ended his eight-year stint as San Miguel head coach. Fajardo said he remains in touch with Austria – who he fondly calls “Pops” – after being together for a decade, going back to the time when they still represented the Beermen in the ASEAN Basketball League. Austria went on to join Fajardo and San Miguel in the PBA in 2014 and steered the storied franchise to nine championships – a stretch that also saw the 6-foot-10 big man crown himself the MVP a record six straight times. “Of course I miss him,” said Fajardo in Filipino. “But we still talk.” Fajardo, though, said it has not been much of an adjustment for him and the rest of the Beermen after San Miguel promoted former lead deputy Jorge Gallent to head coach. Their first two games in the Governors’ Cup are proof, with the Beermen thrashing Phoenix and Blackwater by an average of 20 points for a 2-0 start. Fajardo, who is on track for a record-extending seventh MVP plum, has also been his usual self as he norms 18 points, 14.5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 1.5 steals. “Coach Jorge has been with us for a long time. His system is almost the same as coach Leo, there are only a few adjustments,” said Fajardo. Fajardo added Gallent wants to build on the winning tradition started by Austria. “Coach Jorge always reminds us to continue the winning goals of coach Leo,” Fajardo said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/ukraine-raids-home-billionaire-war-time-anti-corruption-crackdown/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Security services searched the home of one of Ukraine’s most prominent billionaires on Wednesday, February 1, moving against a figure once seen as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s sponsor in what the authorities called a war-time anti-corruption purge. The action, days before a summit with the European Union, appears to reflect determination by Kyiv to demonstrate that it can be a steward of billions of dollars in Western aid and shed a reputation as one of the world’s most corrupt states. It came as Kyiv has secured huge pledges of weapons from the West in recent weeks offering new capabilities – the latest expected this week to include rockets from the United States that would nearly double the firing range of Ukrainian forces. Photographs circulating on social media appeared to show Ihor Kolomoiskiy dressed in a sweatsuit and looking on in the presence of an SBU security service officer at his home. The SBU said it had uncovered the embezzlement of more than $1 billion at Ukraine’s biggest oil company, Ukrnafta, and its biggest refiner, Ukrtatnafta. Kolomoiskiy, who has long denied wrongdoing, once held stakes in both firms, which Zelenskiy ordered seized by the state in November under martial law. Separate raids were carried out at the tax office, and the home of Arsen Avakov, who led Ukraine’s police force as interior minister from 2014-2021. The SBU said it was cracking down on “people whose actions harm the security of the state in various spheres” and promised more details in coming days. “Every criminal who has the audacity to harm Ukraine, especially in the conditions of war, must clearly understand that we will put handcuffs on his hands,” Ukraine’s security service chief Vasyl Malyuk was quoted as saying on the SBU Telegram channel. The prosecutor general’s office said the top management of Ukrtatnafta had been notified it was under suspicion, as were a former energy minister, a former deputy defence minister and other officials. Kolomoiskiy, who faces a fraud case in the United States, has been at the center of corruption allegations and court disputes for years that Western donors have said must be resolved for Kyiv to win aid. Zelenskiy, who first came to fame as the star of a sitcom on Kolomoiskiy’s TV station, has long promised to rid Ukraine of so-called oligarchs, but had faced accusations that he was unable to move decisively against his former sponsor. In an address overnight before the raids, he alluded to new anti-corruption measures in time for Friday’s summit, at which Ukraine is expected to seek firm steps towards joining the EU. “We are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective,” he said, promising to reveal the details soon. Ukrainian forces which recaptured swathes of territory from Russian troops in the second half of 2022 have seen their advance stall since November. Kyiv says the key to regaining the initiative is securing advanced Western weaponry. Two US officials said a new $2 billion package of military aid to be announced as soon as this week would for the first time include Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB), a new weapon designed by Boeing. BA.N The cheap gliding missiles can strike targets more than 150 km (90 miles) away, a dramatic increase over the 80 km range of the rockets fired by HIMARS systems which changed the face of the war when Washington sent them last summer. That would put all of the Russian-occupied territory on Ukraine’s mainland, as well as parts of the Crimea peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014, within range of Kyiv’s forces. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the arrival of longer range US weapons would escalate the conflict. Western countries pledged scores of advanced main battle tanks for the first time last week, a breakthrough in support aimed at giving Kyiv the capability to recapture occupied territory this year. But the arrival of the new weapons is still months away, and in the meantime, Russia has gained momentum on the battlefield, announcing advances north and south of the city of Bakhmut, its main target for months. Kyiv disputes many of those claims and Reuters could not independently verify the full situation, but the locations of reported fighting clearly indicate incremental Russian advances. Troops were fighting building to building in Bakhmut for gains of barely 100 meters (yards) a night, and the city was coming under constant Russian shelling, a soldier in a Ukrainian unit of Belarusian volunteers told Reuters from inside the city. Ukraine’s general staff said late on Tuesday its forces had come under fire in Bakhmut and the villages of Klishchiivka and Kurdyumivka on its southern approaches. South of Bakhmut, Russia has also launched a major new offensive this week on Vuhledar, a longstanding Ukrainian-held bastion at the junction of the southern and eastern front lines. Kyiv says its forces have so far held there. The infusion of Western military and financial aid creates new pressure on Zelenskiy to demonstrate his government can clean up Ukraine. Last week, he purged more than a dozen senior officials following a series of scandals and graft allegations in the biggest shakeup of Ukraine’s leadership since the invasion. Following Wednesday’s raids, the parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People party, David Arakhamia, wrote on Telegram: “The country will change during the war. If someone is not ready for change, then the state itself will come and help them change.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-urges-mutual-forgiveness-to-end-congo-conflict/,[],"KINSHASA, DR Congo – Pope Francis on Wednesday, February 1, urged people in Democratic Republic of Congo, where decades of armed conflicts have killed millions, to grant each other a “great amnesty of. the heart” and called on Christians engaged in battle to lay down their arms. On the first full day of his trip, his third to sub-Saharan Africa as pope, Francis presided at an open air Mass for a crowd local authorities estimated at more than a million people on the grounds of a secondary airport in the capital Kinshasa. The Congolese have given the pope one of the most vibrant welcomes of his foreign trips. On his arrival on Tuesday, tens of thousands lined his motorcade route. At the sprawling site on Wednesday his popemobile moved slowly on the runway, with hundreds of thousands of people singing and dancing on either side before he began a Mass from a large altar platform. Many women wore dresses with his picture emblazoned on them, as is customary in many African countries to honor dignitaries, while children climbed on a disused plane for a better view. The country’s people, the Pope said in his homily, were suffering from “wounds that ache, continually infected by hatred and violence, while the medicine of justice and the balm of hope never seem to arrive”. Armed conflict has left 5.7 million people internally displaced and 26 million facing severe hunger, according to the United Nations. Francis said God wanted the people to find “the courage to grant others a great amnesty of the heart”. “What great good it does us to cleanse our hearts of anger and remorse, of every trace of resentment and hostility!” he said. Eastern Congo has been plagued by violence connected to the long and complex fallout from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda. Congo accuses Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group fighting government troops in the east. Rwanda denies this. “We left because of the war,” said Lea Serundoru, 21, a high school student who fled fighting in Rutshuru territory near the border with Uganda, an area that was hit by fighting between the army and M23 last year. A papal stop in the eastern city of Goma, foreseen when the trip was originally scheduled for last July, was later scrapped because of the flare-up in violence last year. Serundoru said she hoped “the armed groups would listen to the pope and put down their arms because he is a strong and powerful man, and we have faith that everything will return to normal”. About half of Congo’s population of 90 million are Roman Catholics and in his homily, Francis addressed them as well as other Christians involved in the fighting. “May it be a good time for all of you in this country who call yourselves Christians but engage in violence. The Lord is telling you: ‘Lay down your arms, embrace mercy,'” the Pope said. Thousands of people had spent the night praying at the airport in the build-up to the service. “The country is not well. There are divisions, hatred, lots of massacres, especially in the east. After the Pope’s homily, I hope peace will return,” said Patrick Mukaba, a 35-year-old lawyer, who was there with his wife Laetitia. Congo has some of the world’s richest deposits of diamonds, gold and other precious metals, but its wealth has stoked conflict between government troops, militias and foreign invaders, as well as driving exploitation and abuses. The Pope will meet victims of violence from the eastern part of Congo later on Wednesday. Thursday will be his last full day in Congo, before he departs on Friday for neighboring South Sudan, another country grappling with conflict and hunger, on Friday morning. For the South Sudan visit, he will be with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church of Scotland Moderator, an unprecedented joint foreign trip by the three Christian leaders. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/nfl-quarterback-tom-brady-retiring-for-good/,[],"National Football League quarterback Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls and is considered one of the game’s all-time greats, said on Wednesday, February 1, that he was retiring, a year after he made the same announcement only to change his mind weeks later. “I am retiring for good,” Brady said in a 53-second video message that he posted on Twitter. “Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream.” The 45-year-old Brady spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots before relocating to Florida and leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl championship in 2021. He retired after last season but reversed course 40 days later and returned to the Buccaneers, leading them to the playoffs again in the current season before the team was eliminated by the Dallas Cowboys last week. In October, halfway through the season, Brady announced that he and his wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, had ended their 13-year marriage. They have two children together. Brady’s commitment to continue playing was believed to be one of the wedges that drove the couple to divorce. Bundchen had expressed worry over Brady’s health playing in the often violent workplace that is the NFL, conceding in an Elle magazine story that she had those discussions with her husband adding, “I would like him to be more present.” The northern California native is widely regarded as the best quarterback in league history. He appeared in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning the game seven times. He also won the Super Bowl MVP award five times and his 15 Pro Bowl selections are the most in league history. He was named the league’s most valuable player three times. A lightly regarded prospect coming out of the University of Michigan, Brady was the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. But he made the most of his opportunities and quickly turned around the fortunes of the Patriots franchise. He would go on to build one of the greatest dynasties across any sport. Brady now appears headed to the television broadcast booth having already agreed to a reported 10-year $375 million contract to join FOX Sports as lead analyst and ambassador for the network. Coming ahead of Groundhog Day in the United States on Thursday, some on social media pointed out that they had heard this before. There were a number of teams reportedly interested in signing the free agent future Hall of Famer for next season, including the Las Vegas Raiders, Tennessee Titans, and Miami Dolphins. While Brady appeared frustrated and weary at times throughout last season, he still produced on the field, leading the Buccaneers to the playoffs. He passed for 4,694 yards, ranking him behind only Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl-bound Patrick Mahomes and Los Angeles Chargers Justin Herbert and his 25 touchdown passes were among the top 10 in the league. Word of Brady’s second retirement again sparked tributes across social media from around the world. “Greatest of All Time. No question, no debate,” said three-time NFL defensive player of the year JJ Watt, who announced his retirement earlier this year. “It’s been an honor and a privilege.” England soccer captain Harry Kane offered his congratulations and said he looked forward to catching up with Brady at a totally different sport. “Congrats on an amazing career @TomBrady,” tweeted the Tottenham Hotspur striker. “See you on the golf course soon.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-recovers-radioactive-capsule/,[],"SYDNEY, Australia – Australian authorities on Wednesday, February 1, found a radioactive capsule smaller than a coin that was lost in the vast Outback after nearly a week-long search involving around 100 people along a 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) stretch of highway, officials said. The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 kms per hour equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia. The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 meters from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added. The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto’s RIO.L, RIO.AX Gudai-Darri mine in the state’s remote Kimberley region. The gauge was being taken to a facility in the suburbs of state capital Perth – a distance longer than the length of Great Britain. People had been told to stay at least five meters (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness. However, driving past it was believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray. Western Australia’s Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an “extraordinary result” after a search involving the state’s emergency response department, defense authorities and radiation specialists. “When you consider the scope of the search area, locating this object was a monumental challenge, the search groups have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,” he said. A 20-meter exclusion zone has been set up around the capsule while defense force members verify it via a serial number. It will then be placed in a lead container and stored overnight at a secure location in Newman, a mining town roughly 1,200 km north-west of Perth, before being taken to the state capital on Thursday. The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour. Officials said the capsule apparently fell off a truck during transport and landed on the side of the road, adding that it was unlikely there will be contamination in the area. Rio is willing to pay for the cost of the search if asked by the government, iron ore division head Simon Trott told reporters. He added there would be a full investigation into the circumstances of its loss and the company would put in place additional controls to prevent a recurrence. Rio said in a statement that it would investigate whether the use of specialist contractors had been appropriate, having entrusted the gauge to SGS Australia and Centurion for packaging and transportation respectively. SGS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Centurion said in a statement it was seeking answers about how the capsule became dislodged during transportation given the crate and pallet provided by SGS arrived in Perth in the same condition as at the start of the journey, and GPS data had shown no sudden changes in speed. “From a freight and logistics perspective this indicates a routine journey, and the fact that the crate was not opened for a week until after delivery reinforces that view,” Centurion said. Western Australia’s Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975. The maximum penalty for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is A$1,000 and A$50 per day the offense continues, though the state government said on Wednesday it was considering a change to laws to allow for bigger penalties. Officials said any change to penalties would not be retrospective. – Rappler.com"

Wednesday’s stock losses saw Adani slip to 15th on Forbes’ rich list with an estimated net worth of $75.1 billion, below rival Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd who ranks ninth with a net worth of $83.7 billion. Before the critical report by US short-seller Hindenburg, Adani had ranked third. The losses mark a dramatic setback for Adani, the school-dropout-turned-billionaire whose fortunes rose rapidly in recent years in line with stock values of his businesses that include ports, airports, mining, cement, and power. Now, the tycoon is fighting to stabilize his companies and defend his reputation. The share slides come just a day after the Adani Group managed to muster support from investors for a $2.5-billion share sale for flagship firm Adani Enterprises, in what some saw as a stamp of investor confidence at a time of crisis. The report by Hindenburg Research last week alleged improper use by the group of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation. It also raised concerns about high debt and the valuations of seven listed Adani companies. The group has denied the allegations, saying the short-seller’s narrative of stock manipulation has “no basis” and stems from an ignorance of Indian law. It has always made the necessary regulatory disclosures, it added. Shares in Adani Enterprises, often described as the incubator of Adani businesses, plunged 28% on Wednesday, bringing its losses since the Hindenburg report to more than $18 billion. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone dropped 19%. Both stocks marked their worst day ever. “The kind of fall that we are seeing in Adani stocks is scary,” said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Mumbai-based Profitmart Securities. Adani Power and Adani Wilmar fell 5% each, and Adani Total Gas slumped 10%, with all three falling by their daily price limits. Adani Transmission was down 3% and Adani Green Energy 5.6%. Adani Total Gas, a joint venture with France’s Total, has been the biggest casualty of the short seller report, losing about $27 billion. Dollar bonds issued by Adani entities also resumed their slide on Wednesday. The US dollar-denominated bonds of Adani Ports maturing in February 2031 led the losses, falling 3.59 cents to 67.58 cents. Underscoring the nervousness in some quarters, Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse had stopped accepting bonds of Adani Group companies as collateral for margin loans to its private banking clients. Deven Choksey, managing director of KRChoksey Shares and Securities, said this was a big factor in Wednesday’s share slides. Credit Suisse had no immediate comment. After losing $86 billion in recent days – equivalent to 16% of India’s annual budget spend of $550 billion announced on Wednesday – the seven listed Adani Group entities now have a combined market capitalization of about $131 billion. “There was a slight bounce yesterday after the share sale went through, after seeming improbable at a point, but now the weak market sentiment has become visible again after the bombshell Hindenburg report,” said Ambareesh Baliga, a Mumbai-based independent market analyst. “With the stocks down despite Adani’s rebuttal, it clearly shows some damage on investor sentiment. It will take a while to stabilize,” Baliga added. Asked whether he was concerned about wider losses on India’s equity markets because of the plunge in Adani Group shares, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said the government “does not comment on issues related to a particular company.” India’s benchmark Nifty index has fallen 2.7% since the Hindenburg report. Data also shows that foreign investors sold a net $1.5 billion worth of Indian equities after the Hindenburg report – the biggest outflow over four consecutive days since September 30. Scrutiny of the conglomerate is stepping up, with an Australian regulator saying on Wednesday it would review Hindenburg’s allegations to see if further inquiries were warranted. India’s markets regulator, which has been looking into deals by the conglomerate, will add Hindenburg’s report to its own preliminary investigation, sources have told Reuters. The regulator has not commented on the Adani-Hindenburg saga. Indian credit rating agency ICRA Ltd, a unit of Moody’s Investors Service, said on Wednesday it was monitoring the impact of the developments on its rated portfolio in Adani Group. It added that while the group’s large debt-funded capital spending plan was a “key challenge,” some of it was discretionary in nature and could be deferred, depending on the liquidity position. India’s state-run Life Insurance Corporation said on Monday, January 30, it would seek clarifications from Adani’s management on the short-seller report. LIC owned a 4.23% stake in Adani Enterprises as of end-December and more than 9% in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. The insurance giant was also a key investor in Adani’s recent share sale. Shares in cement firms ACC and Ambuja Cements, which Adani Group bought from Switzerland’s Holcim for $10.5 billion last year, fell 6.2% and 16.7%, respectively. Hindenburg said in its report it had shorted US-bonds and non-India traded derivatives of the Adani Group. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/neil-etheridge-extremely-disappointed-upset-racist-incident-2023-fa-cup/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Goalkeeper Neil Etheridge said he’s committed to heightening awareness on racism after the Philippine Azkals star became a target of a racial slur during a football match. “I know that one individual does not speak for an entire fanbase or everyone in society,” Etheridge posted on Twitter on Wednesday, February 1. “I am proud of what I did to bring to light, once again, an ongoing problem that we all have a responsibility to tackle head on. Racism and all forms of discrimination should not be tolerated.” Etheridge, who plays for the top-tier English club Birmingham City, reported an “incident of racism” during their 2-2 draw against the Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup last Sunday, January 29 (Manila time). After the opposition equalized the match during stoppage time, racial slurs were allegedly hurled towards the Filipino-British footballer, according to Sky Sports News. “We cannot eradicate it overnight, but if we can all keep doing our bit to educate those out there, I hope and pray that my child, and our children, can grow up in a better world,” said Etheridge. The Sky Sports News report said the alleged abuse came from a Rovers home supporter perched behind Etheridge’s goal, prompting the keeper to report it to referee Keith Stroud. The 32-year-old Philippine football star was “visibly upset” after the incident, Birmingham boss John Eustace reportedly said. Blackburn, Birmingham, and the Football Association released similar statements acknowledging and condemning the incident, with the league announcing that it will investigate the matter. The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) also threw its support behind the Azkals co-captain. “PFF condemns any racial abuse and believes that there should be no room for this type of behavior in football,” the PFF said in a statement. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/pet-care-tips-champion-dog-owners/,['AMANDA T. LAGO'],"MANILA, Philippines – If there’s anyone who knows how to take care of a dog (aside from a veterinarian, of course), it’s the owner of a champion dog. While there is a debate surrounding how ethical dog shows actually are (the way they promote purebred dogs is questionable), one thing’s for sure: many of the dogs that are entered into these competitions are perfectly groomed, well-fed, well-taken care of, and very much loved. At the Philippine Canine Club Inc’s (PCCI) Philippine Circuit 2023 held last January 12 to 15, competing dogs and their owners took over the Araneta Coliseum, and in between shows, many of the hardworking puppers got hugs and pets from their furparents. On the sidelines of the event, we asked owners of champion dogs – a Corgi and a Boxer – about their best tips for taking care of your dog. As it turns out, whether you’re taking care of a majestic champion dog or a derpy freeloader, the advice is pretty much the same. Here’s what they say: Whether you’ve had your doggo for years or are still just considering what dog to bring home, knowing everything about your pet (or potential pet)’s breed is important. That way, you’ll know exactly what they need in terms of training, exercise requirements, and even what kind of discipline style works with them. For instance, Albert and Marilen Chan, furparents of a Boxer named Freddy, shared that despite their fierce looks, the breed is actually very affectionate (in fact, Freddy who was named PCCI’s Top Dog of 2022, continued to ask for cuddles as his furparents spoke to Rappler). “Boxers are very friendly and affectionate. They love to hug, see? They love to hug. They just look fierce, but they’re good family dogs. They don’t bite. They just want to hug, smell, and lick. They’re really such gentle giants,” Marilen shared. Because of this, they give extra affection. “I treat them like my kids. I talk to them like I talk to my kids, Total TLC,” she added. Meanwhile, Ronnie Laborada, the owner of a show Corgi named Cinnamon, shared that the breed is actually a herding dog, so they benefit from having a lot of exercise. “Requirement sa Corgi dahil working dog siya, kailangan maburn yung mga pagkain niya. Kailangan mamaintain mo yung walking every day (Because Corgis are working dogs, they need to burn what they eat. You need to walk them every day),” he said. Speaking of exercise, it’s one thing that ALL dogs should get regularly, regardless of their breed. Working breeds like the Corgi need more exercise because they’re genetically wired to have something to do. Ronnie shared that his Corgis get 30 minutes of walking in the morning, 30 minutes in the evening, and lots of playtime in between. For Freddy the Boxer, a one- to two-kilometer run every other day and lots of free roaming in between is enough to fulfill his exercise needs. Any furparent will know that food is one of the biggest expenses that come with these adorable freeloaders. As tempting as it is to opt for the cheaper kibble though, parents of champion dogs advise against it. “Maraming dog food na mura…pero may difference yan. Malimit yung mga mumurahin, mataas yan sa sodium, kaya gusto ng aso kasi maalat. Problema mo naman, after a few years, may kidney problem na yung aso mo. Yun yung mga kailangan iwasan,” Ronnie said. (There are lots of affordable dog food brands, but there’s a difference. Often the cheap ones are high in sodium, and dogs like them because they’re salty. The problem is, after a few years your dog will get kidney problems. That’s what you should avoid.) Albert also suggested mixing up your dog’s diet so they don’t get bored of their food. “Pag medyo nagsasawa na siya sa kibble (when he’s tired of kibble), we do raw food, raw diet. We mix it up, pwede ding combination, may konting kibble may konting raw (you can also do a combination, some kibble, some raw),” he shared. Consult a vet to know what brand of dog food they recommend, and what veggies and meat are safe to mix in with your pet’s food. Dogs are pack animals, so allowing them to meet and play with other dogs should be a priority. However, Ronnie suggests being mindful of who you allow your dog to mix with, and ensuring that they are up to date on all their vaccines. He also reminded owners to keep them from being exposed to environments that are dirty, or places where they may potentially catch diseases. Even the vet could be a potential breeding ground for illness, so he suggests limiting your time there. Here’s something most dog owners might not pay attention to – air-drying your dog after baths might not be enough. It doesn’t matter whether they are shorthaired or have a long coat; giving them a proper blow-dry should be part of their grooming and bathing routine. “If you don’t dry the dog, kahit anong dog, pag pinaliguan mo, basa, pagnagstay ng basa yung skin niya, magkakaroon yan ng mga fungal problem (no matter what the dog, if you bathe it, it’s wet and if his skin stays wet, he’s going to get fungal problems),” he said. If you want your dog to be a well-behaved member of society, your best route would be to start training them as early as possible – even as young as two or three months, as Albert and Marilen did with Freddy. Albert shared that he trains his dogs daily, but is mindful not to overtain them. “Five to ten minutes daily lang or every other day hanggang sa sanayan lang…. I do shorter training time but mas madaming frequency kasi pag bored na, di na sila natututo,” he said. (We only do five to ten minutes daily or every other day until he learns…. I do shorter training times with more frequency because when the dog is bored, he doesn’t learn.) Being consistent with teaching them and practicing comands is beneficial in more ways than one. A trained dog is easier to trust, and also training sessions make them super tired, which helps prevent any naughty behavior. If you aren’t already practicing these things, try incorporating them into your dog care routine bit by bit. After all, it doesn’t matter whether your dog is best in show, or simply best in siphoning all your money – at the end of the day, our best friends deserve only the very best care. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/lebanon-devalues-official-exchange-rate-february-1-2023/,[],"BEIRUT, Lebanon – Lebanon devalued its official exchange rate for the first time in 25 years on Wednesday, February 1, weakening it by 90% but still leaving the local currency well below its market value. The pound has crashed since a financial meltdown in 2019 after decades of corruption, profligate spending, and mismanagement by the ruling elite in Lebanon which has left the crisis to fester despite soaring poverty. The central bank confirmed the new official rate of 15,000 pounds per dollar, scrapping the rate of 1,507.5 pounds at which the currency was pegged for decades before the collapse. Market participants said the pound was changing hands at around 60,000 per dollar on Wednesday on the parallel market where most trades take place. Lebanese officials have described the adoption of the new official exchange rate as a step towards unifying an array of rates that have emerged during the crisis. Unifying multiple exchange rates is one of several steps sought by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Lebanon to clinch a $3-billion aid package that would help it to emerge from the meltdown. But the IMF said last year progress in implementing reforms remained “very slow,” with the bulk yet to be carried out despite the gravity of a crisis marking Lebanon’s most destabilizing phase since the 1975-1990 civil war. The new rate will be applied to limited withdrawals in local currency from US dollar accounts, from which depositors have been largely unable to withdraw hard currency since 2019. It is also due to be applied to customs duties in the country that depends heavily on imports. Central bank governor Riad Salameh told Reuters on Tuesday, January 31, the change would also lead to a decrease in the equity of banks. In the absence of reforms to plug a $70-billion hole in the financial system, depositors have shouldered the burden of the collapse as they have been frozen out of their hard currency savings or forced to withdraw in pounds at a heavy loss. Withdrawals in Lebanese pounds from hard currency accounts at the new official rate will still suffer a de facto haircut of 75% based on Wednesday’s market rate. Toufic Gaspard, an economist who has worked as an adviser to the IMF and to the Lebanese finance minister, said the move was not a major development in the bigger picture. “Following the biggest banking collapse in modern history, nothing has been done for the last three and a half years. Not a single significant measure has been taken by the authorities in the political, monetary, and fiscal domains,” he said. “They are telling the poor depositors you will get a little bit more but then this is eaten up by inflation and taxes.” Nasser Saidi, a former economy minister and central bank vice governor, in a note said the move was a “continuation of [a] failed exchange rate pegging/fixing policy that has generated the biggest financial crisis in history.” – Rappler.com"

Simmons erupted for 45 points to go with 12 rebounds and 3 steals for the Road Warriors, who also leaned on big baskets from Kevin Alas and Kris Rosales late to gain a share of the lead in the standings with a 3-0 record. NLEX tied fellow unbeaten squad Converge for the top spot. The Tropang Giga were primed to stay unbeaten after enjoying a lead as big as 15 points near the end of the third quarter, 91-76, but they fizzled out in the fourth period, where they got outscored, 32-17. Still down 84-96 in the final frame, the Road Warriors rode on a 20-2 run sparked by a Rosales jumper to seize a 104-98 lead, which they preserved until the final buzzer thanks to a pair of clutch buckets from Alas. Simmons scored 8 points during the stretch before Alas scored 4 points inside the final 1:20 minutes for a 110-106 edge with 40 seconds left. Although Kelly Williams pulled TNT within a single possession right after, 108-110, and pulled off a defensive stop on Simmons to get a crack at the equalizer, Roger Pogoy muffed a well-contested short stab as time expired. “We never got rattled as a group,” said Simmons, who is set to leave NLEX after his fourth game for the Road Warriors against Phoenix on Saturday, February 4. “We stayed composed throughout the game.” Sean Anthony stepped up for NLEX with 15 points and 6 rebounds, including his win-sealing stop on Pogoy.

https://www.rappler.com/business/gatchalian-wants-senate-blue-ribbon-committee-probe-pagcor-pogo-auditor/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines – Senator Sherwin Gatchalian urged the Senate blue ribbon committee to look into the alleged anomalies hounding the third-party auditor tasked to examine accounts of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs). In a resolution filed on Monday, January 30, Gatchalian said the inquiry should seek to identify accountability after Global ComRCI, the company contracted by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor), seemed to have skirted procurement rules. In hearings of the Senate ways and means committee led by Gatchalian, it was found that Pagcor entered into a P6-billion, 10-year contract with Global ComRCI, despite the company failing to meet the required operating capital of at least P1 billion. The same inquiry also found that Global ComRCI does not have business permits from the city governments of Makati and Manila, where it supposedly held offices. The Securities and Exchange Commission also said the company is not registered with the agency. Global ComRCI is responsible for reporting the correct gross gaming revenues of POGOs. Gatchalian earlier noted that inaccuracies led to leakages, including an underpayment of the 2% franchise fee and 5% gaming tax. Pagcor contracted Global ComRCI for technical work in 2017, as online gambling was a relatively new industry and regulators supposedly did not have the infrastructure to monitor POGOs’ money flows. Pagcor has been taking a beating in Senate hearings, unable to directly answer questions on POGO-related data and crimes tied to the industry, despite its goals of growing online gambling. In a statement on Wednesday, February 1, Pagcor said that since new management took over in August 2022, all contracts, including that of Global ComRCI, have been put under review. “Pagcor’s new management is revalidating the veracity of the documents submitted by its third-party auditor, Global ComRCI. Should Pagcor be able to prove that the documents submitted were spurious, it will immediately take legal action and cancel the contract of its third-party auditor, if found warranted,” the agency said. Pagcor also denounced POGO-related crimes and assured the public it would continue to monitor the “lawfulness of the activities of its accredited licensees and service providers.” “Pagcor believes that while gaming operations – including offshore gaming – contribute significantly to government revenues, they must not be used as a vehicle for abuse and injustices.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-to-send-general-to-myanmar-to-highlight-transition-jokowi-says/,[],"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesia plans to send a top general to Myanmar to talk to its junta leaders in the hope of showing Myanmar’s military rulers how Indonesia made a successful transition to democracy, President Joko Widodo said on Wednesday, February 1. Southeast Asian biggest economy takes on the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year and with it the responsibility of trying to resolve the region’s perennial problem of the suppression of democracy in fellow member Myanmar. “This is a matter of approach. We have the experience, here in Indonesia, the situation was the same,” the president, who is widely known as Jokowi, told Reuters in an interview in his offices in Jakarta. “This experience can be addressed, how Indonesia began its democracy.” Indonesia, now the world’s third-largest democracy, was ruled by military leader Suharto for more than three decades before he stepped down amid mass protests and an economic crisis in 1998. The military took over in Myanmar in 1962, isolating the country and suppressing dissent for decades until a tentative opening up began in 2011. But its experiment with democracy, which included elections swept by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, came to end and two years ago when the military ousted Suu Kyi’s government, reimposed strict military rule and crushed protests. With Myanmar again drawing Western condemnation and sanctions, ASEAN came up with a five-point plan for it, including an end to violence, dialogue, humanitarian assistance, and a visit by an ASEAN envoy to all sides. But Myanmar’s generals, while paying lip service to the ASEAN effort, have shown no inclination to implement it, and previous ASEAN envoys have achieved little. Jokowi, speaking on the second anniversary of Myanmar’s 2021 coup, said he was committed to the plan but added that ASEAN would “not be held hostage” to the Myanmar conflict and if there was no progress it would “act decisively”. He did not elaborate on any action. Jokowi said he did not rule out travelling to Myanmar himself, but acknowledged that dialogue would likely be “easier” between officials from similar backgrounds. The president declined to say who he hoped to send “as soon as possible” but suggested the person he had in mind was involved in Indonesia’s reforms. ASEAN has seen differences over how to handle Myanmar with some members, like Thailand, hopeful of engaging with it through initiatives like an unofficial forum in December that was boycotted by half the bloc. Other members have appeared increasingly frustrated with the Myanmar military and are keen to maintain a ban on its top officials taking part in ASEAN forums. Managing rifts over Myanmar, and escalating tension in the disputed South China Sea, will be among the main challenges for Indonesia in its role as ASEAN chair. As president of the Group of Twenty (G20) last year, Indonesia positioned itself as a diplomatic bridge on the crisis between Russia and Ukraine and managed, against the odds, to get a joint declaration across the line at a leaders’ summit in Bali in November. Now Jokowi will have to try to manage the various geopolitical rivalries while keeping the region’s focus on his priority of economic growth. “The situation is not easy,” he said, “ASEAN must continue to be peaceful region and also ASEAN must continue to be the epicentre of growth.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-rate-eurozone-january-2023/,[],"FRANKFURT, Germany – Eurozone inflation eased for the third straight month in January but any relief for the European Central Bank (ECB) may be limited as underlying price growth held steady and concerns have already been raised about the reliability of the figures. Inflation across the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 8.5% last month from 9.2% in December, driven by a fall in energy costs even as food and industrial goods kept upward pressure on prices, Eurostat data showed on Wednesday, February 1. That figure was well below the 9% predicted by a Reuters poll of economists. Price growth has been in rapid decline since peaking at a record 10.6% in October but the ECB has already promised more interest rate hikes, fearing that without higher borrowing costs inflation could become entrenched above its 2% target. ECB policymakers meeting on Thursday, February 2, are almost certain to raise rates by half a percentage point to 2.5%, and the biggest question is how much more tightening it will signal. The drop in headline inflation is unlikely to expunge concerns among conservative policymakers that rapid price growth is becoming entrenched, a worry reinforced by high underlying inflation on Wednesday. Inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices picked up to 7% from 6.9% while an even narrower measure watched closely by the ECB held steady at 5.2%, exceeding forecasts for 5.1%. Underlying inflation was driven by a jump in processed food and industrial goods prices but services inflation, a key worry because it reflects wage growth, eased a touch. “As the ECB’s attention is gradually turning away from the main measure and onto core inflation, we think that falls in headline inflation will do little to stem the central bank’s hawkishness,” said Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics. “We therefore think that ECB is going to hike interest rates by 50 bps (basis points) this month and next, with a risk of another 25-bps hike in May if inflationary pressures fail to moderate as we expect.” Another issue is the reliability of the data. Unlike in other months, data from Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, is missing and Eurostat was forced to use a model-based estimate. “Let’s not get carried away by a number that is missing a third of the information. For all practical purposes, the January inflation print is delayed,” Nordea said in a note. January figures are also prone to unusual volatility because of start-of-the-year price changes, economists say. Hawkish policymakers are likely to argue that a milder-than-expected economic downturn will mean a smaller increase in unemployment, so that wages will remain under upward pressure and force the ECB to raise rates even more. Eurozone unemployment held steady at 6.6% in December, its lowest rate on record, separate data showed on Wednesday. ECB hawks are also likely to say that core inflation is at risk of getting stuck well above the ECB’s 2% target as the second-round effects of high energy prices feed through, potentially leading to a spiral. Markets now expect ECB rates to peak at 3.5%, the highest rate in over 20 years, suggesting another 100 bps of hikes after Thursday’s move. Policy doves from the bloc’s south are likely to fight back, however, arguing that the economy has already started to respond and more time is needed for past policy moves to take effect. They will point to figures this week showing bank lending is set for its biggest drop since the bloc’s 2011 debt crisis and negative growth last quarter in big eurozone economies Germany and Italy. Unexpectedly positive – though meager – eurozone growth in the final months of 2022 may have been due largely to the exceptionally mild winter weather, which kept a lid on energy costs for businesses and households, and strong Irish data. Falls in market-based natural gas prices – now below their levels from before Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago – and oil prices, also down from last summer’s highs, should further ease price pressures. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/senators-scrutinize-maharlika-investment-fund-first-public-hearing/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) proposal faced renewed questions about its funding sources, effectivity, and safeguards as deliberations began in the Senate Wednesday, February 1. During the controversial sovereign wealth fund’s (SWF) first Senate public hearing, senators questioned whether establishing a SWF would truly be necessary, given the country’s current economic situation and the existing tools it already has for investment and development. Read through our comprehensive coverage of the hearing as it happened here. “The Philippines has a high level of debt-financed programs, and no new sources of funds have come into consideration since the MIF discussions started. And because instead of paying debt, we are putting up a SWF, in effect, the Philippines is borrowing the money for the SWF. We should perhaps call it a sovereign liability fund as it is effectively funded by liabilities,” Senator Risa Hontiveros said in the hearing, quoting a former bank president. To this, National Treasurer Rosalina De Leon came to the MIF’s defense, explaining that a sovereign wealth fund could help reduce the country’s reliance on debt. “We were looking into this fund to attract more equity because then investors will have long-term placements in the fund, and at the same time, share in the risk in the fund.” Instead of the national government borrowing for development projects, De Leon said that global co-investors could invest their money through the MIF and share in the risks and rewards. She referred to the success of the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA), Indonesia’s first sovereign wealth fund, as the template the Philippines could emulate. However, this hope that the establishment of the MIF could attract lucrative investments and consequently lower the country’s debt was among the fund’s many promises that senators challenged. For instance, Hontiveros pointed out that the Philippines does not currently have an attractive investment portfolio of oil and mineral wealth, unlike the Indonesian SWF. Instead, it only has its relatively modest initial capital of P75 billion sourced from the coffers of government banks. Still, De Leon maintained that there was strong interest in the fund from global investors. After the World Economic Forum at Davos, the Department of Finance went on a roadshow pitching the Maharlika fund to other investors. De Leon said that there was “good reception,” but that investors were waiting for the legislation to pass to know more about how they can participate in the fund. De Leon said it was possible for the MIF to quadruple in capital once it is opened to investors. This was based on the growth of Indonesia’s SWF, which started with an initial capitalization of $5 billion and has risen in value to $20 billion with commitments and pledges from other sovereign wealth funds and global investors. Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno also said that the government could sell unused or underutilized assets, such as the Caliraya hydropower plant. The government also owns a building in New York and four properties in Japan that they could consider selling. Diokno also regretted that the proceeds from the extraction of natural resources from the Malampaya gas field were wasted when it could have been used for a SWF. “The Malampaya proceeds, that’s around P20 billion e. Nasayang lang po ‘yun. Kung saan-saan napunta po ‘yun. Sana nagamit natin for the wealth fund. (We missed an opportunity. The proceeds were wasted. We could have invested it for the wealth fund),” he said. He also eyed using proceeds from the royalty of the now-reopening mining sector to bolster the Maharlika fund. Senators also questioned what advantage the Maharlika fund provided when the national budget and other existing government financial institutions (GFI) could already be used to finance development projects. Finance Assistant Secretary Eufrocinio Bernabe Jr. gave the example that if the MIF were allowed to invest in toll roads like the North Luzon Expressway, the fund could earn as much as P16 million a day. However, Hontiveros pointed out that it’d still be possible to pursue lucrative development projects even without creating a new entity like a sovereign wealth fund. Representatives from both the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) confirmed that they could theoretically invest in a project like a toll road. Diokno explained that the purpose of creating the Maharlika fund is to widen the options available to the government. “When you have a fund like this, and we’re thinking of funding huge, large infrastructure projects – for example if you’re thinking of building a subway – instead of borrowing money from Japan, you can use this fund to invest in this particular undertaking.” He also noted that relying on funding from the government can delay projects because funds may be disbursed in limited amounts over many years – or funding may be cut altogether. “Kung dedicated ‘yung Maharlika fund for huge projects na ganun, mas madali pong magagawa. For example, mag-aallocate kami ng P1 billion for a project. Pag dating nang Congress, i-cucut ng Congress,” he said. (If the Maharlika fund is dedicated for huge projects like that, we can move faster. For example, let’s say we allocate P1 billion for a project. When it gets to Congress, Congress just cuts it.) Aside from the issue of added value, Senator Chiz Escudero also noted that the law should be further clarified to show how LBP and DBP will earn from their investments in the fund, given that the bill is silent on whether they get a share of the fund’s profit. “Parang pinuwersa mo ‘yung dalawang bangko, even PAGCOR, to give money. Wala akong nakita sa bill na may share sila on their investment,” he said. (It’s as if you’re forcing the two banks, even PAGCOR, to give money. I didn’t see anything in the bill saying that they have a share on their investment.) De Leon agreed that the bill needed to be more explicit, but she explained that a part of the fund’s profits will be given to Landbank and DBP. Once those have been paid, 25% of the excess profit will go to social services. The other 75% will be reinvested into the fund as retained earnings. Escudero also wondered why the MIF should be exempted from the oversight of the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG). “If you really want this MIF to succeed, the more heads that are participating in crafting policies and being a part of it, I think it would be better and best than simply coming from one group all obeying the command and will of the President because they’re all co-terminus with the President and serve at his pleasure, unlike the GCG,” Escudero said. Escudero also cautioned that the tax exemptions given to the Maharlika fund – which neither the LBP or DBP currently enjoy – could “wreak havoc.” Not only would it create difficulties in paperwork, but it could also open a loophole for abuse. “It will be a gaping loophole insofar as entities selling to the MIF, MIC is considered because they will claim its sold to them even if it’s not and then claim the exemption,” he said. There were also concerns that regulatory exemptions for the LBP and DBP may give them an unfair advantage over other private banks. However, the DBP clarified that unless they were exempted from complying with regulatory ratios, they could only invest P400 million. “Without the relief, we can only invest P400 million at this time. The regulatory relief will remove the investment in the MIF from the computation of our risk-based capital adequacy ratio,” a representative from the DBP said. “Without the regulatory relief, if we put in the investment that is being asked of us, then we will breach the regulatory ratios.” When it came to safeguards, senators also doubted whether the promise of simply finding the “best and brightest” to manage the fund was enough to protect it. “Aside from what Secretary Diokno said – and I agree with him – that we appoint the best possible individuals with the best possible reputation, so you have their reputational collateral as an additional safeguard, pero ano po ‘yung in addition to that? Because ‘yung binaggit po na (but what do we have in addition to that? Because these) fiduciary duties, that’s present in a lot of corporations, and yet we see a lot of corporate misdeeds,” Senator Sonny Angara said. Even after being assured that the MIF will be reviewed by several layers of audit, Senator Joel Villanueva was unconvinced, pointing to how the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) had circumvented audit safeguards. “‘Yung PAGCOR got a third-party auditor, external auditor, spent P6 billion, hindi makita kung nasaan ‘yung office. Sabi accredited by international bodies, pero wala. Tapos merong bangko nagcertify na OK siya, pero ‘yung bangko na ‘yun, ni hindi registered dito sa Pilipinas,” he said. (PAGCOR got a third-party auditor, external auditor, spent P6 billion, and then we couldn’t even find their office. They claimed they’re accredited by international bodies, but there’s nothing. And then a bank supposedly certified that they’re OK, but that bank wasn’t even registered in the Philippines.) Introduced only in late November, the Maharlika fund proposal steamrolled past the House of Reprsentative on December 15, 2022, after Marcos certified it as urgent. Zubiri now estimated that the Senate could pass the measure after the Holy Week break. The Maharlika fund proposal, which cleared the lower chamber in only 17 days, is expected to go through several more Senate committee hearings. – Rappler.com"

He was 93. “The Commission on Higher Education is deeply saddened by the loss of a great leader, researcher, and scientist. He leaves behind a colorful legacy in the history of higher education as a former CHED chairperson who played a pivotal role in building sanctuaries and promoting biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems,” CHED said in a statement. Alcala served as CHED chairman and, before that, environment secretary during the Ramos administration. In his decades-long experience as a biologist, he made major contributions to marine biology research in the Philippines. He conducted extensive research on Philippine reptiles and amphibians, and founded the Silliman Marine Laboratory – the venue for his research on marine protected areas. In 1992, Alcala received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service for “pioneering scientific leadership in rehabilitating the coral reefs of the Philippines and in sustaining for Filipinos the natural abundance of their country’s marine life.” Later in 2014, he was conferred the title of National Scientist by then president Benigno Aquino III. “Work on the conservation and management of the unique biodiversity, for which the Philippines is known, has given me a feeling of satisfaction that my academic degrees have been useful not only to me and my family but also to the country,” Alcala had said in a Rappler story published after his conferment as national scientist. “My pursuit of excellence in research was motivated by my desire to help in the conservation of our natural resources by putting to work my academic education and training.” Alcala finished his bachelor’s degree in biology at the Silliman University in Dumaguete City in 1951, then started as a biology teacher for students preparing to enter the nursing profession and medical school. He would later serve as university president for two years. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/pakistan-moves-toward-deal-default-endgame/,[],"Pakistan’s full-blown economic turmoil, from its biggest ever currency devaluation to a rash of emergency spending cuts, offers the clearest sign yet that the nuclear-armed nation faces the risk of a default unless it receives massive support. Pushed to the brink by last year’s devastating floods, the South Asian nation has reserves of just $3.7 billion remaining, or barely enough for three weeks of essential imports, while hotly contested elections are due by November. It desperately needs the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to release an overdue tranche of $1.1 billion, leaving $1.4 billion remaining in a stalled bailout program set to end in June. Although an emergency IMF mission has arrived in Pakistan, there are no guarantees amid a growing number of headaches after November’s suspension of disbursements from the current package, which was topped up to $7 billion after the floods. A devaluation of 15% in the Pakistani rupee and a rise last week in fuel prices could help eliminate some key snags, particularly as tax measures are apparently imminent. Yet pressure is building as the bailout program cannot be extended beyond June and the elections loom. “If they don’t get those [IMF] funds, default risk increases materially,” said Kathryn Exum, the co-head of sovereign research at distressed debt specialist fund Gramercy, which expects more of a debt “reprofiling” rather than mass write-off. Pakistan’s former finance minister, Miftah Ismail, who successfully negotiated an extension to last year’s program before being sacked in the political tumult, also thinks the IMF is the only logical option. “If the IMF doesn’t come in, we’re looking at a default,” Ismail said, adding that another support package, the country’s 24th, would then be needed. “I can’t imagine Pakistan not going on a back-to-back IMF program.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s main election challenger is former cricket star Imran Khan, who was removed from the job last April but retains popularity. Each blames the other for the crisis, although finances have long been strained. With Pakistan’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in a danger zone of 70%, and between 40% and 50% of government revenues earmarked for interest payments this year, only default-stricken Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Nigeria are worse off. “There is just a long-term indebtedness problem,” said Jeff Grills, the head of emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management, who held Pakistan bonds until the floods hit. “It is more a question of when they need to restructure, rather than if.” Most of Pakistan’s bonds are still trading at less than half their face value. Such a restructuring of Pakistan’s bonds would represent its first international default since 1999, according to the Bank of Canada-Bank of England Sovereign Default Database. With just $8.6 billion worth of such bonds, compared to the $30 billion Pakistan owes to China, Ismail said Islamabad might be better off “just going to those countries that we owe a lot, or to the institutions we owe a lot, and trying and get some more long-term loans.” Sharif is optimistic that the IMF will resume disbursements. “An agreement with the IMF, God willing, will be done,” he said at an event last week in Islamabad, the capital. “We will soon be out of difficult times.” Multilateral and bilateral financing pledges for Pakistan’s rebuilding efforts after the floods also depend on a green light from the IMF. But even domestic analysts believe the government will find matters tough, as the IMF is likely to demand significant belt-tightening that is bound to be unpopular with voters already grappling with decades-high inflation and fewer job prospects. IMF officials have been eager to support poorer countries and Pakistan promises to be a crucial partner for the West, but paying out gets trickier when a program is close to its end and a new government could come in and try and tear up a deal. If the disbursements do not arrive by June, there could be a six-month gap before the new government takes office during which Pakistan would be starved of funds, effectively pushing its population of 220 million to the brink. The lack of reserves will make it to tough to stay afloat. Just $500 million of interest or “coupon” payments are due on Pakistan’s international bonds this year, but the chief of the central bank chief has said $3 billion is needed to meet overall external debt payments. The political timing is also critical. After the government’s tenure ends in August, a special caretaker government will take charge for up to 90 days to ensure free and fair elections. However, the caretaker government is not empowered to sign an IMF pact, raising the question of whether the government and opposition can cooperate on a joint pledge to push through any IMF demands in order to avert a default. “If something happens with the disbursement and then the elections get in the way, they might have a problem,” Gramercy’s Exum added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/china-coast-guard-patrols-presence-west-philippine-sea-2022/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – A United States-based think tank said increased patrols by the China Coast Guard (CCG) in the South China Sea amounted to a near-daily presence around key features in the disputed waterway last year. The Second Thomas Shoal (Ayungin Shoal), Luconia Shoals, Scarborough Shoal (Panatag Shoal), Vanguard Bank, and Thitu Island (Pag-asa Island) were among the five areas most frequented by Chinese ships in 2022, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (AMTI-CSIS) in Washington, DC. Three of these features – Ayungin Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Pag-asa Island – are in the West Philippine Sea. In a report released Tuesday night, January 31 (Manila time), the AMTI-CSIS said it documented this trend using automatic identification system (AIS) data from commercial provider MarineTraffic. “China’s coast guard presence in the South China Sea is more robust than ever,” AMTI said, adding the number of days that CCH ship patrolled the five features “increased across the board.” At Ayungin Shoal, or Second Thomas Shoal, CCG patrols grew to cover 279 days in 2022 from 232 in 2020. A Philippine Navy ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, remains perched on a portion of the shoal and serves as an outpost for the Philippines after it deliberately ran aground in 1999. The shoal lies 105 nautical miles west of Palawan. Around Scarborough Shoal, CCG patrols increased from 287 days to 344 days. AMTI likewise noted the multiple CCG vessels were often present simultaneously. Near Pag-asa Island, meanwhile, CCG vessels were seen 208 days out of the year. No data was collected on the area in previous analyses. The striking numbers, though almost at a daily presence, were likely to be an undercount, AMTI said, considering AIS data was often incomplete. AMTI also pointed out that some CCG vessels’ AIS transceivers may be disabled, remain undetected on commercial monitoring platforms, or transmitted incomplete or erroneous data. Scarborough Shoal lies some 120 nautical miles west of Zambales, though Filipino fishermen have reported increasing difficulty accessing the shoal with Chinese ships often barring their entry. The 2016 arbitral award ruled that the shoal was a common fishing ground. Pending a resolution of sovereignty disputes, no country is entitled to exclusive possession of the shoal, though the Philippines considers it a part of its territory. At Vanguard Bank, a major Vietnamese oil and gas development sites, CCG patrols “more than doubled” from 142 days in 2020 to 310 days in 2022. The site has been witness to multiple standoffs between Chinese and Vietnamese ships. Chinese patrols at Luconia Shoals, an area near Malaysian oil and gas operations, also grew from 279 days to 316 days. What might an increase in Chinese patrols mean for the Maritime dispute? The think tank said that a near-daily presence established by patrols, coupled with the presence of its maritime militia, showed China’s “determination to assert control over the vast maritime zone within its claimed nine-dash line.” In 2022 alone, the Philippines documented several incidents where Chinese ships harassed and shadowed Philippine vessels. This included China’s efforts to block resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal and its shadowing of a survey vessel last April. In November 2022, the Philippine government also protested China’s seizure of rocket debris from Philippine sailors when it cut a tow line of Philippine vessel retrieving the objects near Pag-asa island. “As Southeast Asian claimants continue to operate in the Spratly Islands in 2023, the constant presence of China’s coast guard and maritime militia makes future confrontations all but inevitable,” AMTI said. Under the Marcos administration, as of January 3, 2023, the Department of Foreign Affairs has filed at least 68 notes verbales against China over incidents in the West Philippine Sea. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/what-you-should-know-about-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Slow progress has been made between the Philippines and the US in implementing the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Complete fulfillment of the deal, signed in 2014, has yet to be seen. This year, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s visit to the Philippines from January 31 to February 2 includes the agenda of “speeding up” EDCA’s implementation. Four new locations for infrastructure projects were announced on Thursday, February 2. What has happened over the past nine years since the agreement was signed? Including the EDCA, the Philippines currently has three defense-related treaties with the US. The Philippines and the US signed a mutual defense treaty in August 1951, as an agreement to provide support and aid to one another in the event of external attacks. To enhance bilateral defense cooperation between the two nations, the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) was ratified on May 27, 1999. The VFA was meant to allow US troops ease of access to Philippine military installations around the country such as the waiving of visa and passport requirements, among others. Most importantly, the agreement allows the US government to retain jurisdiction over its troops while on Philippine soil unless said crimes are of “particular importance” to the Philippines. With talks that began as early as August 2013, the EDCA was signed between ex-defense secretary Voltaire Gazmin and ex-US ambassador Philip Goldberg on April 28, 2014. It reiterated statements from the previous agreements, adding the construction of infrastructure and military storage facilities in select Philippine bases. The US, however, is not allowed to construct a permanent base in the country. (READ: PH primer on military pact with US) Whatever bases are constructed in the country will eventually be the property of the Philippine military. Nuclear weapons are not allowed to be stored in the Philippines, under the agreement. The agreement had an initial validity of 10 years, and will automatically be in force until a one-year notice is given by either party to terminate the agreement. The 10-year validity period will end on June 25, 2024, or a year from now. After its signing, the EDCA underwent much criticism, particularly for its constitutionality. Petitions were written to the Supreme Court (SC) in May 2014, declaring its unconstitutionality due to the agreement not being signed without Senate approval. Other petitions have called the agreement an “unequal and exploitative love affair.” (READ: Justices to EDCA critics: How to defend West PH Sea? and SolGen: EDCA no guarantee US will aid PH in sea dispute) Oral arguments began on November 18, 2014, and ended on November 25 that year. The SC ruled 10-4-1 on January 12, 2016, for the agreement to be constitutional, maintaining that the EDCA is an executive agreement that does not need Senate approval. Different issues have surfaced surrounding the EDCA over the past nine years. Months into the EDCA’s signing, US Marine Joseph Pemberton was suspected of murdering transgender Jennifer Laude in October 2014. Due to the VFA in effect, US authorities took custody of Pemberton and denied the request of local authorities for the custody of the soldier. (TIMELINE: The killing of Jennifer Laude and release of Joseph Scott Pemberton) Pemberton was charged with murder and trials began a year later. He was found guilty of homicide on December 1, 2015. Then-president Rodrigo Duterte pardoned Pemberton in September 2020 and was deported a few days after. Duterte himself wanted to rid of EDCA, putting it under review and saying that he wanted to scrap it altogether. Projects under the agreement were put on hold during his administration. At the time, only one base in Palawan had construction completed. He eventually upheld the agreement during then-US president Donald Trump’s visit to the country on November 2017. Later into the Duterte administration, the two countries met in Washington DC in September 2021 to discuss bilateral agreements, including the resumption of projects under the EDCA. The Department of National Defense released a statement in November 2022 stating that three of five infrastructure projects will begin the following year, as the US commited $66.5 million towards construction. – Rappler.com"

It was the second deepest contraction since the second quarter of 2020 when gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 9.4% as COVID-19 took a toll around the world. Economists from Morgan Stanley, DBS, Hang Seng Bank, and Natixis expected GDP to contract between 2.8% and 3.1%. The city’s economy shrank a revised 4.6% in the third quarter. “Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to show a recovery in 2023,” the government said, adding that China’s growth recovery and rebound in tourism from the removal of quarantine restrictions should lend support. On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the economy remained virtually unchanged in the October-December period as compared with a 2.6% contraction in the third quarter. For the whole of 2022, GDP shrank 3.5%. The Asian financial hub has been battered by its own pandemic measures and also spillover from China’s zero-COVID policies, but recovering consumer spending on the mainland and a rebound in travel are expected to help the economy this year. However, Hong Kong is facing risks from high inflationary pressure and aggressive monetary tightening in advanced economies. Higher borrowing costs and a pessimistic economic outlook have hit asset prices, dragging 2022 private home prices down 15.6% in the first annual drop since 2008. Barclays, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, and DBS forecast Hong Kong’s GDP to grow between 2.1% and 6.5% in 2023. The government said an improved economic outlook, return of business activities, and a strong labor market should boost private consumption in 2023, and fixed asset investment will benefit. “The real impact of the still partially reopened border with mainland China will only be felt from the second quarter, meaning the pressure will prevail in the short run,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank. Strict COVID-19 restrictions have affected Hong Kong’s economy since early 2020, grinding tourism to a halt and battering sales at bars, restaurants, and shops. Hong Kong’s top leader John Lee has prioritized improving international competitiveness and attracting more overseas talent, and most restrictions have already been lifted apart from the wearing of masks. Last week, Lee said he aims to lift all COVID-19 restrictions within this year and lead the global financial hub towards a full return to normality. “Even though there are cyclical upsides from China, Hong Kong will likely grow by 3% in 2023 and only touch its pre-pandemic level by yearend due to the negative impact of high interest rates on exports and consumer sentiment,” Ng said. “The city is still lagging regional competitors.” – Rappler.com"

Sadang was a former associate justice of the Court of Appeals and served as a former vice executive judge and presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court. All five members, including the one whom Abalos did not name, are “known for their unquestionable integrity, credibility, and untainted reputation,” the interior chief said. Abalos clarified thought that it will not be the committee which will implement the resignation process. Instead, the 5-man committee will forward to the National Police Commission (Napolcom) the list of officers whose resignations they recommend to be accepted. It is Napolcom which is tasked to administer and control the PNP in the first place. “That’s a long process. You’ve got to file a case, you’re up against people,  so much money, so much power… Baka bago tayo matapos, hindi na ako nakaupo dito (I might no longer be in this position before the process even ends). But the problem is there, you’ve seen it, it’s growing,” said Abalos in a chance interview. Aside from the Napolcom, there’s another mechanism in place that is meant to hold erring officers into account: the PNP’s Internal Affairs Service (IAS), which is headed by a lawyer not from the police force. “Kaya merong advisory group [para] hindi nila sabihin na parang may bias…at least independent ito mag-scre-screen (The advisory group is there so they cannot say that there was bias in the process.) But Abalos said the process needs to be hastened. “The longer they are there, the more damage they are going to do to our country,” he added, referring to the allegedly erring cops. Abalos, in early January, called on police generals and colonels to hand in their courtesy resignations in a supposed effort to “cleanse” the police force of officials with links to illegal drugs. Of the PNP’s 955 generals and colonels, Abalos said only 12 did not submit their courtesy resignations – five of them retired officials and 6, those who are about to retire. Only one active officer refused to hand over a courtesy resignation, citing his personal prerogative, said Azurin. Abalos also declined to divulge the profile of the senior police official who held out. Even as Abalos issued that “challenge” to police generals and colonels, he did not actually require them to resign. So that official who refused to hand in his courtesy resignation cannot and will not be sanctioned, said Abalos. The committee is eyeing a three-month window to finish its screening process. After that? Even more reviews, said Abalos. “Just look at the gaps. Kasi nga (Like I said), we are into cleansing,” he added. The review includes “reviewing the organization itself,” including its recruitment channels and the Philippine National Police Academy, which produces most of the officers in the PNP, as well as the jail and fire bureaus. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/macau-casino-revenues-january-2023/,[],"HONG KONG – Macau posted an 82.5% year-on-year rise in gambling revenue to 11.6 billion patacas ($1.4 billion) in January, after the world’s biggest gambling hub had nearly half a million visitor arrivals over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. The crowds were the biggest in more than three years, but January’s revenue was still less than half of the Lunar New Year period in 2019 prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, according to data released by Macau’s government on Wednesday, February 1. Still investors took cheer, sending shares in Macau casinos up between 3% and 5%, while executives and analysts said it was an encouraging sign of a solid recovery to come. A special administrative region of China, Macau has seen a resurgence of tourists from the mainland since January 8 after the territory dropped all COVID-19 testing requirements for inbound travelers from the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Tens of thousands of tourists streamed daily into Macau’s casinos and picturesque cobbled streets over the Lunar New Year holiday from January 21, a stark contrast to the dearth of visitors into the former Portuguese colony since 2020. Macau is the only place in the country where gambling in casinos is legal. It had closely followed China’s zero-COVID strategy since 2019 and reopened alongside the mainland. January’s revenues were the first for Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts & Entertainment, and SJM Holdings under new 10-year contracts. The casinos had launched under 20-year contracts in 2002, raking in billions of dollars and turning a sleepy fishing village into a glitzy boomtown. The new contracts, with more government oversight and control, were struck after COVID-19 restrictions decimated Macau’s gambling revenues and sent net debt soaring. The industry had its worst revenue performance on record in 2022. The city’s once lucrative VIP industry has also collapsed following several arrests in Macau’s junket industry. A Macau court on January 18 sentenced Alvin Chau, one of the city’s most well-known figures, to 18 years in prison. Casinos have committed to investing a total of $15 billion in the coming decade, 90% of which must be spent on developing non-gaming plans that include an indoor waterpark, health and wellness centers, art exhibitions, and a large garden attraction by Sands, similar to Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay. Stakes are high as to whether they can successfully deliver on a government mandate to increase non-gaming revenues to more than 30% of the total versus an average of 5% pre-COVID. In Las Vegas, around 50% of revenues are non-gaming. Rob Goldstein, chairman and chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, majority owner of Sands China, said the company has been seeing a very strong recovery in Macau since the lifting of COVID restrictions. “We’re just thrilled to be open and making money and seeing demand like we’re seeing,” he told an analysts call last week. However, labor shortages are becoming apparent as resorts and retail stores rush to boost staff to keep up with demand, and a Sands executive said it was not operating some hotels at full capacity as a result. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/chess-legend-anatoly-karpov-marks-world-title-match-milestone-manila/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov returned to the capital city just in time to commemorate the 45th anniversary of his classic match against Soviet émigré Viktor Korchnoi. Karpov, then the top-ranked player in the world, beat the second-ranked woodpusher Korchnoi in Baguio City during the 1978 World Chess Championship. The match is noted in the annals of history for its tension-filled matchup – and at the same time strange – with both sides accusing each other of alleged hypnotism and intimidation. “I’ve visited Manila five times since 1976 and I can see a big development of the Philippines,” said Karpov during a short lecture at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum on Wednesday, January 31. He also credited the country for spearheading the rise of the sport in the continent. “The Philippines played an important role for chess especially in Asia,” he remarked. Accompanied by Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Marat Pavlov, Karpov was received by the country’s top sports officials, led by Philippine Sports Commission chairman Richard “Dickie” Bachmann, and commissioners Olivia “Bong” Coo, and Walter Torres. Eugene Torre, the first chess Grandmaster in Asia, also met with his peer, and reminisced about some of the battles they waged in the 1970s. “Personally I’m very proud of my result against Karpov considering he’s a world champion and he’s a kind of champion who is very difficult to beat,” recalled Torre, who had two wins, four losses, and five draws against Karpov. “It was big news because at that time Karpov would rarely lose a tournament or even a game,” recollected the 71-year-old Pinoy chess legend, referring to their 1976 matchups at the Meralco-Loyola King’s Challenge. A 2021 film based on the Baguio face-off, Champion of the World, was shown to the hundreds of chess enthusiasts that attended the event. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/south-korea-exports-imports-trade-deficit-january-2023/,[],"SEOUL, South Korea – South Korea‘s economy inched toward its first recession in three years as data on Wednesday, February 1, showed its January trade deficit soared to a record thanks to a plunge in exports caused by a combination of long holidays and cooling global demand. Asia’s fourth largest economy, which relies heavily on trade for growth, shrank by 0.4% in the October-December quarter and is now on the brink of falling into what would be its first recession since the middle of 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Exports fell 16.6% in January from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed, worse than an 11.3% decline predicted in a Reuters survey and the fastest drop in exports since May 2020. Imports fell 2.6% compared with a year earlier, less than a 3.6% drop predicted in the survey. As a result, the country posted a monthly trade deficit of $12.69 billion, setting a record amount for any month. “I have a 0% forecast for the first-quarter growth but today’s trade figures are definitely a minus to that,” said Park Sang-hyun, economist at HI Investment and Securities. The increasing chances of recession – two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product – also underscore growing bets in markets that the central bank’s campaign of raising interest rates since late 2021 has run its course. Leading the sluggish trade performance in January were a 44.5% dive in semiconductor exports and a whopping 31.4% plunge in sales to China, the trade ministry data showed. Both were the worst rates of decline since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. South Korean bond yields fell across the board on the growing bets for a less restrictive monetary policy ahead, while stock and currency investors largely shrugged off the monthly figures. Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho blamed long lunar New Year holidays in China and a steep fall in computer chip prices versus a year ago for the sharp declines in export values, adding China’s reopening would help ease the situation over time. “The government will mobilize all available policy resources to help support a drive to boost exports so that the timing of improvement in trade balance can be advanced,” Choo said at a meeting of trade-related officials, without elaborating. The government has forecast this year’s exports would fall 4.5% after posting a 6.1% gain in 2022, and the trade ministry has said it would do what it can to avert a decline. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/sibuyan-island-residents-form-human-barricade-stop-mining-trucks/,['IYA GOZUM'],"MANILA, Philippines – In the past week, residents of Sibuyan Island in Romblon have been forming a human barricade to block the entry of trucks with nickel ore. Residents are demanding the suspension of the operations of Altai Philippines Mining Corporation (APMC) in the area. Police have also been deployed in the area on Wednesday, February 1. “The people will continue to stand their ground and prevent the trucks from passing through,” said Rodne Galicha, executive director of environmental group Living Laudato Si’ Philippines, who is in Sibuyan Island to join the protest. “We will continue our barricade because the mining company has no permits and social license,” he added. Galicha said around 200 residents joined the human barricade but police could not provide an official estimate as of posting time. Sibuyan Island is home to Mt. Guiting-Guiting, one of the most famous climbs in the country known for its ridges and unique flora and fauna. A public scoping for the mining project was held last January 19. This is required under the Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System. In APMC’s project description for the scoping, mining operations are expected to last for at least 25 years. The mining company is poised to construct access roads, settling ponds, haul roads, and a stockyard, among others, for the project. The proposed nickel mining project covers 1,580.8010 hectares, and products from the mine are to be exported. The government granted APMC a mineral production sharing agreement on December 23, 2009, giving assent for the company to conduct mining exploration activities. In 2011, the DENR canceled APMC’s permit based on a complaint by then-San Fernando, Romblon mayor Dindo Rios. According to a CNN Philippines report, the company had claimed that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) allowed them to export 50,000 metric tons of nickel ore for testing overseas. Sibuyan residents are strongly opposing APMC’s operations which environmental group Alyansa Tigil Mina described as “destructive to the island’s ecosystem.” They are also demanding that the company show their barangay clearance, municipal business permit, foreshore lease contract from the DENR, and Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) permit to construct a private port. According to protesters, the company has so far failed to produce these documents. “As far as we know, Altai Mining Company does not have these documents. What they are doing, therefore, is illegal,” said Elizabeth Ibañez, coordinator of Sibuyanons Against Mining. “Their activities must immediately stop, especially that the residents of Sibuyan are opposed to any large-scale mining in the region,” she aded. Rappler has reached out to the DENR for comment but has yet to receive a response as of posting. In a statement on Saturday, February 4, APMC denied the allegations and asserted its lawful operations in Sibuyan, and stressed that it is “equally opposed to all forms of illegal, reckless, and irresponsible mining.” “Our right to operate is as inviolable as the right to peaceful protest and assembly. For that reason, we repeatedly reached out to the protesters to establish dialogue, and hopefully find common ground. We hoped that we could assure them that our activities are lawful and compliant to government requirements, and fully aligned with global best practices. Unfortunately, these efforts did not bear fruit,” it added. The company noted that prior to its operations, it consulted with authorities and engaged “the surrounding communities “to ensure that our operations will be safe, legitimate, and with minimal environmental effects.” “We would like to assure the public that APMC will continue to strictly and uncompromisingly adhere to all laws pertinent to our activities, for the current exploration and future development, operation, and rehabilitation plans. We pray that those who may have grievances against this will observe the same,” it said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-magic-air-sovereign-wealth-fund/,[],"The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) concept emerged, surprisingly, as the magic, silver bullet to slay the forces impeding Philippine development. Congressional allies hurriedly packaged and passed the Maharlika Investment Fund Act (MIFA) as President Marcos Jr.’s pabaon to share with potential investors at the Davos World Economic Forum. MIFA enumerates many laudable objectives: create jobs; foster technological transformation; achieve energy and food security; preserve and optimize the use of government financial assets; promote intergenerational management. When a proposal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. One might indeed suspect some carnival magic. Post-Davos pronouncements have since reinterpreted the SWF, illustrating another magical element; the plan appears to shift shape, depending on the audience. Marcos Jr. noted that the SWF implementation must vary according to country-specific conditions and the need to “customize” the concept. Fair enough. But critics point out that the Philippine version lacks the core element of the SWF strategy: a stable source of substantial, uncommitted long-term funds, such as derived, for instance, from developed oil and mineral deposits. Generating great wealth while they last, these assets constitute finite, non-renewable resources. Hoping to bequeath to succeeding generations a share the nation’s God-given patrimony, even less developed countries, like Timor Leste, moved to establish an SWF. The country’s leading business groups and policy think tanks quickly issued a joint statement manifesting their opposition to MIFA. The battle has basically deployed government against private sector experts, some of whom are now reconsidering their earlier generous praise for the Marcos Jr. economic team. The private sector professionals have the credentials and the credibility, as well as the business experience and the independence that few bureaucrats and politicians can match. But they don’t make laws. Those beholden to the government can count both the likely votes on the legislative floor, as well as the costs and benefits for losers and winners. But they have recently shown signs that they can also read and sense public response to current issues. The private sector experts thus need the attention and support of the electorate, who must depend on them to explain highly technical and complex cases in terms comprehensible to us lay readers. The MFI is reportedly evolving from an SWF to an investment fund, which raises another set of issues. In this case, the government will divert from its own government financial institutions (GFI) and government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC) funds that it is already using to cover national needs. What are the implications for the budget items these funds are supporting and the sources to replace them? To give it a running start, MIFA will allow the transfer or secondment of qualified government personnel to MIC in its first five years. What reason might we have to think that they will perform better in MIC than in their current assignments? Hopefully, better performance will result from better compensation, a possibility permitted by MIFA. MIC executives and employees will enjoy exemption from the Salary Standardization Act and any subsequent modifications. The board will decide on compensation and bonus levels, benchmarked against international standards, subject only to the approval of the President. But we are assured that the 15-member board, chaired by the DOF Secretary, will not get more than the maximum annual amounts received by the members of the Monetary Board. So, how much will operating the new agency cost? For the initial operations, the board can disburse as much as 2% of the capitalization, initially set at P75 billion, but subject to possible increases. The government also expects the MIC to attract foreign investors, the objective of the soft launch of the plan in Davos. Investors will part with their funds if they believe they will reap a profit. MIFA explicitly instructs the board to give priority to projects that “yield the highest return on investments.” The promise of higher yields implies acceptance of higher risks. Instead of paying taxes or remitting dividends, MIC will remit all of its net profits to the government, 25% for distribution to families falling below the poverty line and the rest for social welfare and infrastructure projects. MIC can invest in a wide range of ventures, some indeed promising handsome returns, including foreign exchange, metals, listed and unlisted equities, real estate. But these are also subject to external forces that magnify the risks. This directive clashes with the core rationale of the SWF —ensuring intergenerational equity. Investors primed to expect high returns on their funds are unlikely to promote the welfare of unborn generations before their own immediate interests. What if the investments lead to losses rather than profits? Acknowledging this possibility, MIFA states that “the recognition of profits and losses of the MIC shall be attributable to the GFIs and investors.” MIFA provides a government guarantee for the security or debt instruments issued by the MIC to GFI and GOCC. These guarantees will ultimately be extracted from taxpayers. Tapping fresh sources of funds is a legitimate objective. “Customizing” the MFW concept will likely include measures to increase its market appeal. The MFIA already provides relief from direct and indirect local and national taxes imposed by the Local Government Code of 1991 and the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. It will enjoy duty-free importation of supplies and equipment, exemption from provisions of the Government Procurement Reform Act and the GOCC Governance Act of 2011 and the laws on the disposal of government assets. Business needs protection against burdensome red-tape and excessive regulatory costs. But the chronic problem of corruption, recently manifested again in the government’s pandemic response, must prompt questions about potential risks posed by MIC privileges. We have watched this movie before. The public has witnessed enough high-profile investigations magically vanishing. Marcos Jr. has admitted the need for further consultations and “customizing” of the MIF, which justifies the reconsideration of the Act brought to Davos. Perhaps, the congressmen and senators can craft a more responsive and responsible MIFA. That would be magical. – Rappler.com Edilberto de Jesus is a senior research fellow at the Ateneo School of Government."
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/provenciano-food-review-maginhawa-quezon-city/,['STEPH ARNALDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – When it comes to Filipino restaurants, it’s a hit or miss. It’s tricky to find that balance between tasting authentic but not boring; or elevating the cuisine but not butchering it. However, if you do get it right from the get-go, you’re sealed for success. This is why family-owned neighborhood restaurant Provenciano has withstood the test of time, and remains to be one of food capital Maginhawa’s not-so-hidden but always recommended gems, ever since its founding in 2015. It’s regional fare that doesn’t try too hard, but gets it right in terms of flavor, execution, and authenticity. Visit the humble resto any day of the week and I can almost guarantee that Provenciano will be filled – group tables of senior friends reuniting, families taking their balikbayan relatives for a good meal, and couples lining up for a free table. Considering its large space and outdoor seating area, it’s impressive that it’s never without happy diners, and also very understandable. It looks just like your lola’s heritage home, adorned with native decor, contemporary interiors, and a beautiful breezy outdoor patio. It’s traditional and homey, yet elegant – but never pretentious. After all, Provenciano prides itself as a “tour around the Philippines showcasing authentic regional and Spanish influence cuisines.” Expect diverse regional dishes served with familiar flavors and presentation, with portions good for sharing at reasonable price points. Nothing fancy, upscale, or “reinvented” here – each hearty heirloom dish is true to its roots, made to taste almost like home, but with its own flair. If you’re lucky enough to snag a table, here’s what we recommend to put on your order list – a mix of Provenciano’s best-sellers from around the archipelago. If you’re a snacky starter and want something addictive, order the signature Crispy Okoy ng Calamba (P290), an airier, thin, yet still super crispy version of the Filipino deep-fried fritter made with unshelled small shrimp. Think a hybrid between okoy and kropek! The Laguna specialty also uses freshwater shrimp for these not-oily chips, which are seasoned perfectly and served with spiced vinegar. It’s the perfect pulutan or starter to a filling feast! A salad can also act as a light starter or a palate-cleansing accompaniment to the malinamnam ulams ahead. Try Provenciano’s Chinoy Pako Salad (P295), a refreshing mix of crisp fiddlehead ferns (pako), salted egg, cherry tomatoes, shallots, ripe mango (adds sweetness), and fried wantons (adds crunch), tossed in a sweet-tangy calamansi and Palawan honey viniagrette. The beautiful salad, although light, doesn’t lack in freshness nor texture. Provenciano also has a separate Adobo Espesyal menu for everything “adobo.” Adobo – to stew in vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, bay leaves, and peppercorns – is the star method of Provenciano’s crowd-favorite Adobong Balut (P260), a must-try for fans of the polarizing Filipino duck egg. The soft, yellow part of the egg is sautéed in butter, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and seasonings, served with roasted garlic cloves. The adobo sauce is addictive, as its acidity contrasts well with the richness of the balut. You’ll want to sop it up using the solid yolk, and maybe even enjoy it with steamed rice or bread. Filipinos love their vegetables, especially when they’re cooked in familiar ways. For Bicolanos and fans of the regional cuisine, anything cooked in sili and gata (coconut milk) is a sure win – no wonder Provenciano’s Laing ni Ateng (P325) is a best-seller. The Bicolano-style dish of semi-dried taro leaves simmered in rich coconut cream is presented in a mushy heap, as compared to the otherwise stringy and almost dry kind. It’s a a deliciously gloopy blob of creamy goodness, cooked with pork fat and spiced with chili. It’s got salt, spice, and everything nice about traditional laing. If you’re craving for something on the acidic side…maybe a kilawin dish? Kilawin means “to soak fish or meat in vinegar and condiments, eaten either raw or half-cooked.” Try Provenciano’s best-selling Kilawing Puso ng Saging (P330), an asim-kilig veggie dish for fans of sautéed banana heart. The chopped banana heart cooked al dente is simmered in vinegar, coconut cream, and atchuete oil. Don’t leave Provenciano without trying the Sugpo sa Alavar (P740), a worthy ode to Zamboanga’s specialty. Juicy and tender prawns – fresh as they come – are cooked in the famous Zamboangan sauce that’s rich, creamy, and bursting with umami. The smoked coconut cream and regional spices give the dish a distinctive depth. You’ll definitely need an extra cup of rice for this one! For something simple but packed with garlicky flavor, try the best-selling Pusit sa Bawang (P345): tender baby squid sautéed in garlic and olive oil. Nothing ever tasted malansa here! A Filipino feast isn’t complete without meat! A classic is Provenciano’s Tadyang ni Enteng (P670), featuring twice-cooked beef ribs that are crispy on the outside but with meat that’s moist, soft, and fall-off-the-bone good on the inside. It’s cooked in the signature Provenciano marinade, served with a garlic sauce and soy vinegar dip. The Kaldereta sa Bario (P495) is just like the Filipino-Spanish beef stew you’d enjoy at home. It’s a hearty, filling dish of tender chunks of beef, slowly simmered in rich tomato puree, soy sauce, chicken liver, and queso de bola, with olives, carrots, potato, and bell pepper. The saltiness of this saucy, rich ulam is best absorbed by steamed rice! Another favorite was the Pininyahang Manok (P370), the Bicolano specialty of juicy chicken cooked in a rich coconut cream with sweet pineapple chunks for that distinct sweet-sour-creamy goodness. Although Provenciano offers different kinds of fried rice, we were advised that white or garlic rice would be best to fully enjoy and focus on the the different flavors of each viand. Of course, it isn’t the nostalgic Provenciano experience without trying the famous chewy and sticky Puto Bumbong (P175), served with muscovado sugar, coconut, and grated cheese. Don’t sleep on the fluffy, buttery Bibingka (P195) either, also freshly-made upon order at the traditional Simbang Gabi stall located by the entrance. Have them with halo-halo, coffee, or a hot chocolate! Provenciano is located at 110 Maginhawa, Diliman, Lungsod Quezon, Quezon City. It is open daily from 10:30 am to 10 pm.

Jericho Cruz caught fire off the bench and June Mar Fajardo produced a double-double for the Beermen, who notched another blowout victory after crushing Phoenix by 21 points in their conference opener three days prior. Cruz scored 13 of his game-high 22 points in the first half as he conspired with Fajardo and import Cameron Clark in a sizzling start that saw San Miguel open a sizable 63-35 at halftime. Fajardo finished with 17 points, 16 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals, while Clark chalked up 20 points – 14 coming in the first two quarters – with 9 rebounds and 2 assists.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/mayors-approve-single-ticketing-system-errant-drivers/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – Metro Manila mayors on Wednesday, February 1, approved the implementation of a single ticketing system that would unify the enforcement of traffic rules in the capital region. In a Metro Manila Council (MMC) meeting on Wednesday, the local chief executives adopted the single ticketing system by establishing the Metro Manila Traffic Code of 2023. The code provides for a “system of interconnectivity” among government agencies involved in traffic management in the capital region. The code also provides for standardized fines and penalties which will be endorsed to the Land Transportation Office and local councils for adoption. MMC President and San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said the single ticketing system will take effect in March. Zamora added that the local government units (LGUs) in Metro Manila must pass their ordinances adopting the Metro Manila Traffic Code on or before March 15 to fully implement the system. Makati, for instance, has already passed its ordinance. The single ticketing system “will harmonize the existing national and local laws on traffic enforcement to establish effective transport and traffic management in Metro Manila,” reads Resolution No. 23-02 of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). “Its approval and adoption will also help address different procedures of apprehension; payment of fines; redemption of licenses and plates; as well as uncoordinated implementation of traffic laws resulting in confusion of the driving public, loss of money, and productive hours,” the MMDA said in a statement.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/nato-chief-stresses-importance-indo-pacific-partners-amid-security-tensions/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday, February 1, stressed the importance of NATO’s working closely with partners in the Indo-Pacific, saying Europe could not ignore what happens in East Asia because the global security is interconnected. “Working with partners around the world, especially in the Indo-Pacific, is part of the answer to a more dangerous and unpredictable world,” Stoltenberg said at an event hosted by Keio University. “The war in Ukraine demonstrates how security is interconnected. It demonstrates that what happens in Europe has a consequence for East Asia, and what happens in East Asia matters to Europe,” he said, adding that “the idea China doesn’t matter for NATO doesn’t work.” Stoltenberg made the comments as part of a visit to Japan, during which he pledged to strengthen ties with Tokyo to navigate an increasingly tense security environment triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its growing military cooperation with China. Although he said China was not an adversary, the NATO chief said the country was becoming a “more and more authoritarian power” that was displaying assertive behavior, threatening Taiwan, and developing military capabilities that could also reach NATO countries. “We are more than ready to further strengthen and expand the partnership with countries in this region,” he added. Before his stop in Japan, Stoltenberg visited South Korea and urged Seoul to increase military support to Ukraine, giving similar warnings about rising tensions with China. China has criticized NATO’s efforts to expand its alliances in Asia. Russia, which calls its invasion of Ukraine a “special operation”, has repeatedly cast NATO’s expansion as a threat to its security. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/company-profits-focus-central-eastern-europe-inflation-fight/,[],"Even as hopes grow that central European economies can avoid all-out stagflation, the region’s central bankers have their eyes on two potential foes in their fight against inflation: corporate profits and indexation. A fall in gas prices means the region could weather a winter downturn with limited hit to output – good for economic growth but possibly a new trigger for inflation levels already in some cases double those in the economies of the euro area. As a decline in real wages spills over from the Czech Republic into Poland and Hungary, the question is how bold companies will be in the start-of-year repricing of goods and services that already saw hefty markups last year. “Our calculations show that price hikes exceeded cost rises in several sectors,” Hungarian central bank Deputy Governor Barnabas Virag said last week after the bank left its base rate unchanged at 13%, the highest benchmark in the European Union. “We think this has contributed to last year’s fast rise in inflation,” he said. The latest Eurostat data from the third quarter shows gross operating surplus in the corporate sector – a measure of post-wages profit – rising by an annual 34% in Hungary, 22% in Poland, and 16% in the Czech Republic. That is far above growth rates of 10% for the European Union as a whole and just 8% for the eurozone. While Spain’s left-wing government is on the watch for any excess profits made by supermarkets and others, and authorities in Portugal have also seen signs of rising profits, it has not featured strongly in European Central Bank deliberations. A similar debate in the United States last year, where record corporate profits led to questions as to whether companies were fueling inflation in their quest to rebuild profit margins, has also died down. In central European economies like Hungary, however, economists see a possibility that companies will seize on the fact that nominal wages are rising at a double-digit percentage rate, albeit still behind headline inflation. “The pricing power of companies can prevail for longer if they experience no drastic collapse in purchasing power,” ING economist Peter Virovacz said. “Although the change in real wages over the course of the year could be negative, this can be substantially smaller than we had expected earlier.” The net financial result of the Polish corporate sector rose to record highs in nominal terms in the second quarter, as growth in sales revenue outpaced the costs of goods sold, the Polish central bank said in its November inflation report. “This indicates that companies passed on the sharp increases in costs, including those related to high prices of natural gas and electricity, to the prices of final goods,” it said. “Consequently, profitability indicators, including the percentage of profitable firms, remained high.” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has called on state-owned railway firms to cut intercity ticket prices after hikes of between 11.8% and 17.8% this year, making air travel a cheaper option than taking some trains between Poland’s largest cities. The Czech National Bank said in its autumn monetary policy report that sole traders have been able to generate higher-than-usual real profits based on its latest figures, while data on the largest 2,000 Czech firms showed the profit rate in all sectors was at least equal to the pre-pandemic level. The profit rates in key sectors of the economy – trade, transport, and restaurant services – were increasing, it added. Czech central bank Vice Governor Eva Zamrazilova has said corporate margins are one area to monitor for possible price dangers, adding however that recent developments showed consumers were becoming increasingly sensitive to high prices. “That is another thing that I will watch closely, and if something that can be called a profit-inflationary spiral is maintained here, then for me it will be a step to intervene,” said Zamrazilova. Economists at Komercni Banka said the third-quarter profit rate of Czech non-financial enterprises was the highest since the first half of 2021. However, declining demand could make it increasingly hard for companies to raise prices, they said. The Hungarian Competition Office has launched a probe into a sharp increase in food prices, which rose by an annual 49.6% in Hungary in December, by far the highest in the EU. Hungarian food price growth moved broadly in line with regional and EU levels until the start of 2022 but gathered pace from May, when the forint decoupled from central European currencies and weakened substantially against the euro. Some telecommunications companies in Hungary have also raised services prices in response to high inflation, with Deutsche Telekom’s local unit matching last year’s 14.5% inflation rate across its consumer services contracts. “We do not consider it optimal that companies are not setting their prices based on their cost structure but mechanically track last year’s inflation rate,” Hungarian central bank Director Andras Balatoni told Reuters. “We are monitoring developments.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/with-icc-probe-active-canada-urges-philippines-commit-international-obligations/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – Canada has urged the Philippines to uphold its commitments to international law and human rights, following the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to resume its investigation into killings under the bloody drug war of former president Rodrigo Duterte. The ICC’s latest decision, announced on January 26, followed more than a year of waiting after the court earlier paused its probe as a procedural response to the Philippine government’s request for a deferral in November 2021. “If the Philippines believes in upholding international law, including things like UNCLOS (United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea) for example, then the Philippines must also abide by international law,” senior embassy officials told select Filipino journalists, including Rappler, during a briefing on Wednesday, February 1. The senior officials agreed to speak to media on the issue on the condition their names will not be published. The Philippine government has repeatedly argued that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the Philippines after it withdrew from the Rome Statute in 2018. Despite this, Article 127 of the treaty provided that proceedings prior to a country’s withdrawal from the court would remain valid – a similar position adopted by the Philippine Supreme Court. Philippine officials likewise sought to draw attention to a local review of the drug war as proof that the Philippine justice system was willing and able to investigate on its own, though the ICC decided it has so far been insufficient. In a pre-trial chamber report recently published, the ICC said that it “concluded that the various domestic initiatives and proceedings, assessed collectively, do not amount to tangible, concrete and progressive investigative steps in a way that would sufficiently mirror the Court’s investigation.” Canada acknowledged this and urged the Philippine government to ensure accountability in its review of the drug war. “It is not for us to make determinations about whether [they] should or should not (investigate). They have legal expertise, and the ICC has come to [the] conclusion that investigations underway here does not satisfy the need,” the senior officials said. In keeping wit his predecessor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has so far made no move to rejoin the ICC. Administration officials likewise earlier said that any development on the matter would first require “further consultations.” Despite this, Marcos himself has projected a warmer attitude toward human rights before the international community and has said that while his government “cannot stop the drug war,” its focus would be more on prevention and rehabilitation rather than on law enforcement. Canada recognized the new Marcos administration’s interest to act as a responsible member of the international community and also took note of the fact that the Philippines accepted 200 of 289 recommendations put forward by countries during a UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review in late 2022. Still, it said it would continue to raise the issue of human rights with Philippine officials, when necessary. “We are hearing all of the right things from the new administration about wanting to be a responsible member of the International community. We understand and will always respect countries’ domestic sovereignty but where we see issues that are of concern, any healthy adult relationship is one where you can discuss those issues,” the senior officials said. They added: “A lot of the values which we espouse are going to be universal. They’re not western values. We don’t have expectations for others that we don’t hold ourselves.” – Rappler.com"

In October 2021, the ATP launched an investigation into allegations leveled by his ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, who said in a magazine interview that Zverev was emotionally and physically abusive to her during their relationship. Zverev has consistently denied all the allegations. The ATP said the investigation’s primary focus was related to alleged abuses taking place at the Masters event in Shanghai in 2019 but its scope also included alleged misconduct in Monaco, New York, and Geneva based on reports. “A major independent investigation into Alexander Zverev has found insufficient evidence to substantiate published allegations of abuse. As a result, no disciplinary action will be taken by ATP,” it said in a statement. “The investigation was carried out by The Lake Forest Group (LFG), a third-party investigator. “LFG conducted extensive interviews with both Sharypova and Zverev, and 24 other individuals including family and friends, tennis players, and other parties involved with the ATP Tour.” The 25-year-old Zverev issued a statement saying he had maintained his innocence and welcomed the ATP investigation, adding he was grateful that the matter was finally resolved. “From the beginning, I have maintained my innocence and denied the baseless allegations made against me,” he said in a statement on Instagram on Tuesday. “This decision marks a third, neutral, third-party arbiter who has reviewed all relevant information and made a clear and informed decision on this matter in my favor. “In addition to the ATP’s independent investigation, I have also initiated court proceedings in Germany and Russia, both of which I have won… My priority now is recovering from injury and concentrating on what I love most in this world – tennis.” After the 15-month investigation, which involved going through material on Zverev’s electronic devices, the ATP said they were unable to substantiate allegations of abuse or determine that any player offenses took place. “This determination may however be re-evaluated should new evidence come to light, or should any legal proceedings reveal violations of ATP rules,” it added. “Zverev has consistently denied all allegations and supported ATP’s investigation.” Zverev is currently ranked world No. 14. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/airbus-boeing-try-fill-giant-factories-with-small-jets/,[],"PARIS, France – Airbus and Boeing have set the stage for the next chapter in their titanic rivalry by remodeling two of the world’s largest buildings – gutted by changes in air travel. As the last Boeing 747 left its factory on Tuesday, January 31, part of the company’s historic wide-body plant has been earmarked for production of in-demand smaller jets, matching a change of focus at the home of the defunct Airbus A380. The moves ease doubts over the future of Boeing’s underused Everett plant north of Seattle, the world’s largest building by volume, and the empty Jean-Luc Lagardere A380 assembly hall in Toulouse, the world’s second largest by usable space. Everett’s industrial activity has also been sharply reduced by a decision to move 787 output to a single base in South Carolina due to a decline in demand for large planes. The smaller 737 will slot into a bay currently used for some remaining 787 work. Boeing said on Monday, January 30, it would add a new 737 MAX production line in Everett in mid-2024, complementing three already in place at the Renton plant, 36 miles to the south. That comes as Airbus is midway through installing a new production line for its hot-selling A321neo narrow-body jet in the deserted Lagardere building. It has also announced plans to expand a plant in Alabama. Once exclusively serving as fortresses in an economic war over big twin-aisle jets, the colossal plants will become an industrial beehive for profitable single-aisle models, reflecting a surge of demand for short and medium trips. Analysts said Boeing’s move signaled confidence in demand including from China, despite recent trade tensions. But they noted both sites will still have spare capacity as future production strategy and automation move center-stage in the jet market duopoly, ahead of new orders or jet designs. “At this stage in the industry evolution, with no new program starts in the near future, production strategy is coming to the fore,” said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group. Airbus and Boeing were for years evenly matched in the single-aisle market which generates most cash. But Airbus pulled sharply ahead due to strong sales of the A321neo and a safety crisis over the 737 MAX, from which Boeing is just recovering. Boeing aims initially to boost monthly single-aisle output to 50 from 30, and Airbus wants to go as high as 75 from about 45, though analysts question how quickly this can be done. But narrowing the gap is crucial to preserving Boeing’s main cash cow and strengthening the platform for future launches. “[Boeing] don’t want to be in a situation where Airbus moves to 70 and they are stuck at 50. They want to have the possibility of matching what Airbus does,” said economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at consultancy AVITAS. “So this is a very important statement [to Airbus]: ‘We are not going to withdraw from the market,’” he added. Boeing declined to elaborate on Monday’s announcement. Airbus declined to comment. Boeing’s move is also seen as a bid to reinforce its appeal to investors, some of whom have voiced fears that it is drifting after chief executive Dave Calhoun ruled out launching a new plane within the next decade – even though many analysts agree it makes financial and technological sense to wait. “This is Calhoun’s way of signaling: don’t count us out, we’re in this for the long haul,” Lundquist said. Boeing has not said how the line would be designed but both companies are expected to seize on the chance to test the latest automation in part of the market where unit costs are critical. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/gatchalian-focus-ease-social-welfare-dswd-secretary/,['RYAN MACASERO'],"MANILA, Philippines – A day after he was sworn-in as the new head of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Secretary Rex Gatchalian said one of his top priorities is the faster delivery of benefits and assistance. “I spoke with the President about it yesterday. We in Valenzuela are known for the ease of doing business,” Gatchalian said in Filipino in an interview with DZBB on Wednesday morning, February 1. Before becoming DSWD chief, Gatchalian was mayor of Valenzuela City for three straight terms and was elected congressman of the city’s first district in the 2022 election. He said in his new post he would focus on streamlining requirements for those eligible for benefits from social welfare programs and “cleaning up” the list of beneficiaries. “For the record, we are thankful of [former] secretary (Edwin) Tulfo for starting the streamlining of requirements,” Gatchalian added. For Gatchalian, technology was the key. “We want to use new technology to dispense social welfare and assistance.” Aside from streamlining social services, the new DSWD chief said he wanted to also clean up the list of beneficiaries of the different welfare programs. “There is a lot of data, the question is who are we targeting? There is a saying, if you put junk in, then junk comes out. What happens is a system loss,” Gatchalian said.

He said he would look at lists and make sure that the individuals on them are actually qualified for the social benefits.

“There are lists from the PSA, NEDA, the DSWD, we need to look at that,” he said. Gatchalian said that he would also align with the local government units in making sure the families on the list are actually qualified.

“That was the problem with the SAP (Social Ameloriation Program),” Gatchalian said, referring to a special financial aid program during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. He pointed out that the lists of beneficiaries came from the national government, “from the top down”, and not from the LGUs. Gatchalian comes in as the department’s leader over a month after veteran broadcaster Erwin Tulfo made a quiet exit from the DSWD after he was bypassed twice by the Commission on Appointments over citizenship and libel issues.

During Tulfo’s time as DSWD secretary, he told Rappler in a previous interview that he prioritized dropping unnecessary requirements from applying for financial aid from the department, as well as providing livelihood projects to sustain indigent families and dissuade them from coming to the city to beg for alms during the holiday season. Undersecretary Edu Punay, a former newspaper reporter, had been appointed as officer-in-charge on December 27. Tulfo, who was praised for his time as DSWD chief by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, agreed with Gatchalian’s selection as the department’s secretary. (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Erwin Tulfo after his Marcos Cabinet stint) “Secretary Rex Gatchalian is a good friend… the President made the right choice appointing cong Gatchalian as the new DSWD secretary. I believe social services will always come on time. I’ve known him for quite some time now,” Tulfo said in a a mix of Filipino and English in an interview on the ABS-CBN News Channel. On Gatchalian’s appointment, the DSWD said on Tuesday night that they welcome the former congressman’s appointment. “DSWD welcome the appointment of Secretary Rex T. Gatchalian. The DSWD workforce commits to work with the newly appointed secretary in ensuring that the mandate of the department is carried out effectively, efficiently and economically,” the social welfare department said. “The DSWD community supports the President in appointing Secretary Gatchalian to lead the department in its pursuit of compassionate public service with respect for human dignity, integrity and service excellence,” they added. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/italy-promotes-short-term-job-market-shunning-spain-example/,[],"ROME, Italy – Marta Pizza, a 26-year-old swimming instructor, has worked at a Rome sports center for the last two years earning 8.50 euros per hour with no pension contributions, sick pay, or holidays. Italy’s right-wing government is taking steps to facilitate temporary and informal work arrangements like hers, rolling back previous restrictions and angering trade unions, who say the move will exacerbate in-work poverty and stagnant productivity. New Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni‘s government argues that more flexibility will mean more jobs, and induce employers to legalize workers previously not declared at all. The eurozone’s third largest economy has a growing army of workers without stable contracts – around 5 million out of 23 million employed people, according to a study by Italy’s largest union, the CGIL. Like her fellow swimming instructors, Pizza is not on the sports center’s roster of permanent staff, and her contract does not allow for regular shifts. Yet the reality is very different. “We all have weekly shifts assigned and there is no limit to the number of hours we can work,” says Pizza, who boosts her income helping out as a babysitter, cleaner, and waiter. In recent years, some eurozone countries have sought to rein in temporary contracts to promote stable jobs. In Spain, the European Commission even made it a condition for receiving billions of euros in EU pandemic recovery funds. Meloni is moving at least partly in the opposite direction. Her first budget extended some tax breaks for permanent hiring introduced by previous governments, but also increased the scope for the use of job “vouchers.” These are an extreme form of labor flexibility that was largely scrapped in 2017 after an outcry by trade unions, which were promoting a referendum to abolish them. Under the system – even less structured than Britain’s so-called zero-hours contracts – workers are paid through the state welfare agency using vouchers which the employer buys online for 12.5 euros ($13.62) each. The worker gets 9 euros for each 12.5 euros of face value, with 3.5 euros going to cover insurance and pension contributions. There is no contract, so workers have no right to sick pay, holidays, leave or jobless benefits when their employment ends. Vouchers are popular among businesses, but critics say they leave ample room for abuses. Government members close to Meloni say she is also preparing to relax curbs on other forms of short-term work. Under rules imposed in 2018 workers can be hired on a temporary basis for 12 months without restrictions. This can be extended to 24 months under strict conditions such as an unexpected surge in business or to substitute other staff. These rules were already somewhat eased in 2021 during the COVID-19 crisis, and now Meloni intends to go further, something that concerns some experts such as Michele Tiraboschi, a labor law professor at Modena University. “Vouchers and short-term contracts offer firms temporary relief by cutting their costs, but the last 25 years have shown us we should be focusing on the quality of work, on training, on raising productivity to enable higher salaries,” Tiraboschi said. The government will either allow firms to hire workers on temporary contracts for two years without giving any reason or it will broaden the reasons that can be given, officials say. These contracts will possibly be extendable to three years under certain conditions and with trade union agreement. It also plans to reduce the labor tax costs to employers of temporary contracts, which were raised in 2018. A decree is likely to be presented next month. “Flexibility should be seen as an asset and an opportunity, not as a problem,” said Paola Mancini, a senator with Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party. “Restrictions for businesses have to be cut.” Spain, southern Europe’s other major economy, has taken an opposite path, with encouraging results. It has the second highest ratio of short-term workers among the 27 EU countries, at 20.3%, according to Eurostat data for the third quarter of 2022, while Italy is third on 17%. The Spanish percentage was down from 26.1% a year earlier, however, while Italy’s remained stable. A revamp of Spain’s labor rules in March last year has led to a 141% rise in young workers with permanent contracts, official data for December shows. The reform reversed the easy hire-and-fire regime put in place after the sovereign debt crisis a decade ago by abolishing most forms of temporary contracts. It also included a provision to give permanent contracts to seasonal workers in sectors such as tourism and farming. They are entitled to benefits even when not working and can be called up by their employers at any time. Madrid says the reform was a driver of last year’s 5.5% economic growth rate, increasing people’s financial stability and boosting confidence and consumption. In Italy, since 2008 the number of employed people has remained stable at around 23 million. Within that total, the number of temporary workers has jumped by 25% from 2.4 million to 3.0 million. Tania Scacchetti, a leader of the CGIL union, said both the use of vouchers and the encouragement of temporary contracts were driven by an old, free-market model which puts workers in an “instability trap.” “We’ve increased the number of workers but the work is badly paid and precarious. Stable contracts should be the norm, not the exception,” she said. – Rappler.com $1 = 0.9181 euros"

Most restaurants and coffee shops have hung apologetic signs stating that credit cards are not accepted but that dollars are, at the fluctuating parallel market rate. Lebanese use mobile apps to check on the collapsing pound, which has lost some 97% of its value since 2019. Fleets of mobile money exchangers zip to offices or homes to carry out transactions. Highways are dotted with billboards advertising money-counting machines. With credit cards redundant, people document big transactions by taking pictures of the dollar bills used, fanning them out to show the serial numbers. Even the largely paralyzed Lebanese state is moving towards the cash economy: the finance ministry has considered requiring traders to pay newly increased customs tariffs partly in cash. With more banknotes in circulation, crime has risen. Elie Anatian, chief executive officer of security firm Salvado, said yearly sales of safes had grown steadily, with a 15% increase in 2022. Other businesses are faltering. Omar Chehimi imports smaller shipments for his home appliance shop with cash he has on-hand, since banks stopped granting letters of credit for large ones. “Even the companies we source from – Samsung, LG – are only dealing with us in cash,” he said, examining a crumpled $20 bill a customer had used to buy an electric heater. Any recovery hinges on government action to address some $72 billion of losses in the financial system and revive the banking sector. But politicians and bankers with vested interests have resisted reforms sought by the International Monetary Fund to fix the situation and access international aid. Paul Abi Nasr, CEO of a textile company, said the cash economy made it “practically impossible” to enforce taxes “because everything can simply stay outside of the banks.” “The government’s ability to be financially sound down the line hinges on this,” he said, adding that the cash economy also risked Lebanon being listed as a country falling short in the struggle against money laundering and terrorist financing. Western governments, which oppose the role of the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah group, share those concerns. A Western diplomat said foreign governments were worried illicit transactions would rise as cash was harder to track. The US Treasury last week sanctioned Lebanese money exchanger Hassan Moukalled and his business for alleged financial ties to Hezbollah, saying he helped “transfer cash” on its behalf and recruited money exchangers loyal to the group. Moukalled denied the charges. Nassib Ghobril, chief economist at Lebanon’s Byblos Bank, said the pound’s continuing decline meant the cash economy was now also dollarized, “with dollars accounting for approximately 70% to 80% of operations.” “The transformation to a cash economy means the collapse of the economy,” said Mohammad Chamseddine, an economic expert at Lebanese research group Information International. – Rappler.com"

The same brand of camera in question can be bought in the market for around P24,000. “After the certified overpriced bulk purchase of laptops as found by the Senate investigation, now came pieces of evidence pointing to overpricing on purchase of cameras, by the DepEd central office and some field offices. It is both enraging and demoralizing for teachers to hear of such anomalies while we feel everyday the scantiness of funds for education on the ground,” ACT chairperson Vladimer Quetua said. In 2022, the Senate held five extensive hearings on overpriced laptops procured by the DepEd at the height of the pandemic intended for remote learning. The Senate blue ribbon committee recommended the recovery of at least P979 million from DepEd and procurement service of the Department of Budget and Management and filing of charges against them. (READ: Senate panel wants DepEd, PS-DBM to pay P979M for overpricing laptops) “It is disheartening that the agency which is supposed to inculcate honesty and judicious use of money among the young generation has been swarmed with anomalies,” Quetua said.

https://www.rappler.com/business/unilever-ceo-hein-schumacher-profile/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Incoming Unilever chief executive officer Hein Schumacher gets seasick, according to his former boss at food group Heinz, but that never stopped him joining executive sailing trips and sticking them out. “Every year, I’d bring nine of our most promising executives to Florida – just me and them, not their bosses. One year, we were on a catamaran on Naples Bay and Hein started turning green,” ex-Heinz chief Bill Johnson told Reuters in an interview. “The water was only four feet deep and 30 feet away from the shore and he was hung over the side of the boat.” “But even though he knew he was going to be miserable he got on. He was willing to go anywhere and work any hours. Just the most adaptable person who has ever worked for me.” Schumacher, 51, is likely to need all his determination – as well as the experience he gained in food at Heinz and in retailing at Dutch grocer Ahold – when he takes the helm at Unilever from Alan Jope in July. The Dove soap to Hellmann’s mayonnaise giant needs to revive its underperforming food business, while also managing tricky price negotiations with retailers feeling the squeeze from inflationary pressures and a cost-of-living crisis. Encouragingly for Schumacher, who worked as a finance manager at Unilever more than 20 years ago before heading to Ahold, he was warmly welcomed by activist investor and Unilever board member Nelson Peltz – who has a long track record of shaking up consumer goods companies, including Heinz. “I first met Hein when I served as a director at the HJ Heinz Company from 2006 to 2013 and was impressed by his leadership skills and business acumen,” Peltz said. “I was delighted to learn that he was among the top candidates to become the next CEO of Unilever.” Johnson told Reuters that Peltz and Schumacher “get along pretty well” and that Peltz reached out to Johnson last year, around the time Schumacher joined Unilever’s board. “Hein gets to the heart of issues very quickly – which is like Nelson. They’ll get along really well, I have no doubt. Nelson respects capability, honesty, objectivity, and results,” Johnson said. British businessman Allan Leighton, who also worked with Schumacher, described him as “very calm, certain, clear, and a great listener.” “He’s ideal for Unilever,” said Leighton, a former CEO of British grocer Asda who has served on the boards of several retailers and consumer companies. One of the biggest consumer companies in the world with more than 400 brands ranging from detergent to ice cream, Unilever has been trying to win back investor confidence after its stock has underperformed rivals for years, and after a failed attempt to buy GSK’s consumer health business a year ago. Analysts said Schumacher’s appointment signaled Unilever was, for now, unlikely to spin off its food business, which makes Colman’s condiments and Knorr stock cubes, given his experience at Heinz as well as dairy firm FrieslandCampina. “Why hire a food exec if you are planning to sell the food business?” asked Bernstein’s Bruno Monteyne, adding time would tell whether Schumacher was the right choice. “Is he in a good position to turn around the food business? Let’s give him a chance. But I am not sure that his past experience of running a dairy commodity trading business, with additional brands, is the best place. The average margin in his last business was 3% to 4% EBIT margins…that is not what Unilever is aiming for.” Art Winkleblack, another former colleague of Schumacher and the former finance chief of Heinz, was relaxed about Schumacher’s relative lack of experience in personal care. “That wouldn’t worry me a bit. The similarities between food and personal care are more than the dissimilarities – it’ll take him a little while to understand all the products and categories but he’ll come up to speed on that quickly.” Unilever’s food business, worth 20 billion euros ($22 billion) according to Unilever’s most recent annual report, has for years grown at a slower pace than other divisions and has lower margins than beauty and personal care. In 2021, the food unit’s operating profit margin was 14.7% versus 20.4% in beauty and personal care. Historically, food sales have grown at 1% to 3% versus 3% to 5% at personal care, said Tineke Frikee, a fund manager at Waverton Asset Management. “Unilever’s valuation multiples would rise if food was sold,” Frikee said. Schumacher’s experience at Ahold – now Ahold Delhaize – and more than a decade at Heinz – now Kraft Heinz – could also help Unilever in price negotiations with grocers such as Walmart, Tesco, and Ahold itself. “He’s been given a very tough assignment but I have every confidence that if anyone could get Unilever moving in right direction, it’s Hein,” Johnson said. – Rappler.com $1 = 0.9183 euros"

Ildefonso impressed in his first ever starting role for Suwon, finishing with a season-high 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting, 2 rebounds, and 2 assists in close to 18 minutes of play. The UAAP Season 85 champion and Mythical Team member Ildefonso, who was averaging just 4.5 points prior to Tuesday’s matchup, quickly made his presence felt on the offensive end as he unloaded all of his 10 points in the opening period alone to lead Suwon to a slim 22-20 start. Belangel, meanwhile, tallied 8 points on an identical 4-of-7 clip from the field and 2 rebounds in a little less than 21 minutes of action. With Suwon on top by 4, 86-82, Belangel converted on a layup with 11.7 seconds remaining to give Daegu a glimmer of hope, trimming the deficit back to just a single possession. Unfortunately for Daegu, Suwon’s Jarrod Jones put the nail in the coffin in the following play with two free throws that settled the final count at 88-84. Jones dropped a game-high 23 points, while Jung Sung-woo added 22 for Suwon. On the other side, Lee Dae-sung carried the scoring cudgels anew for Daegu with 22 points, while former PBA import Murphy Holloway delivered a double-double of 21 markers and 13 boards. Suwon upped its record to 16-20, while Daegu, which suffered its fourth straight defeat, fell to 13-23.

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/united-kingdom-biggest-strike-action-in-years-february-1-2023/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Up to half a million British teachers, civil servants, train drivers, and university lecturers will strike on Wednesday, February 1, in the largest coordinated action in a generation which the government says will cause widespread disruption. The mass walkouts will see schools close, the military on standby to help at Britain’s borders, and no rail services running across much of the country. Union leaders estimate up to 500,000 people will take part, the highest number for at least a decade, and there will be rallies against a planned new law to curb strikes in some sectors, a proposal they argue will poison relations further. “After years of brutal pay cuts, nurses, teachers and millions of other public servants have seen their living standards decimated – and are set to face more pay misery,” said Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the union umbrella group. “Instead of scheming up new ways to attack the right to strike, ministers should get pay rising across the economy – starting with a decent pay rise for workers across the public sector.” The government says “mitigations” will be in place but the strikes would have a significant impact. “We are up front that this will disrupt people’s lives, and that is why we think that negotiations rather than picket lines are the right approach,” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters. With inflation running at more than 10% – the highest level for four decades – Britain has seen a wave of strikes from health and transport workers to Amazon warehouse employees and Royal Mail postal staff. They are demanding above-inflation pay rises to cover rocketing food and energy bills that they say has left them stressed, feeling under-valued and struggling to make ends meet. On Wednesday, about 300,000 teachers will take action, along with 100,000 civil servants from more than 120 government departments, and tens of thousands of university lecturers and rail workers. Next week, nurses, ambulance staff, paramedics, emergency call handlers and other healthcare workers are set to stage more walkouts, while firefighters this week also backed a nationwide strike. Between June and November, more days were lost to industrial action than in any six months for over 30 years, according to official data. An Ipsos poll released on Wednesday suggested the public was divided on the multiple strike action, with 40% supporting the action and 38% opposed. Sunak’s government has so far taken a hard line with public sector strikes, saying that to give in to demands for large wage increases would only fuel inflation. But with his governing Conservatives trailing the opposition Labour Party by some 25 percentage points in polls, the industrial action is adding to Sunak’s political woes, and surveys indicate the public think the government have handled the strikes badly. So far the economy has not taken a major hit from the industrial action with the cost of the strikes in the eight months to January estimated by consultancy firm the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) at about 1.7 billion pounds ($2.09 billion), or about 0.1% of expected GDP. It put the estimated impact of the teachers’ strikes at about 20 million pounds a day. However, with confidence weak among the public and employers and the economy in a downturn, the strikes were adding to a sense of gloom in Britain’s economy. “Unresolved industrial disputes are having an adverse impact on growth at a time when recession is already expected imminently,” CEBR economist Karl Thompson said. – Rappler.com ($1 = 0.8130 pound)"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/united-states-india-partnership-arms-artificial-intelligence/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – The White House is launching a partnership with India on Tuesday, January 31, that President Joe Biden hopes will help the countries compete against China on military equipment, semiconductors and artificial intelligence. Washington wants to deploy more Western mobile phone networks in the subcontinent to counter China’s Huawei Technologies, to welcome more Indian computer chip specialists to the United States and to encourage companies from both countries to collaborate on military equipment such as artillery systems. The White House faces an uphill battle on each front, including US restrictions on military technology transfer and visas for immigrant workers, along with India’s longstanding dependence on Moscow for military hardware. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, are meeting with senior officials from both countries at the White House on Tuesday to launch the US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies. “The larger challenge posed by China – its economic practices, its aggressive military moves, its efforts to dominate the industries of the future and to control the supply chains of the future – have had a profound impact on the thinking in Delhi,” Sullivan said. Doval will also meet Secretary of State Anthony Blinken during his three-day visit to Washington D.C., which ends Wednesday. New Delhi has frustrated Washington by participating in military exercises with Russia and increasing purchases of the country’s crude oil, a key source of funding for Russia’s war in Ukraine. But Washington has held its tongue, nudging the country on Russia while condoning India’s more hawkish stance on China. On Monday, Sullivan and Doval participated in a Chamber of Commerce event with corporate leaders from Lockheed Martin Corp, Adani Enterprises, and Applied Materials Inc. Although India is part of the Biden administration’s signature Asian engagement project, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), it has opted against joining the IPEF trade pillar negotiations. The initiative also includes a joint effort on space and high-performance quantum computing. General Electric Co, meanwhile, is asking the US government for permission to produce jet engines with India that would power aircraft operated and produced by India, according to the White House, which says a review is underway. New Delhi said that the US government would review General Electric’s application expeditiously and that the two countries would focus on joint production of “key items of mutual interest” in defense. The two countries also established a quantum technology coordination mechanism and agreed to set up a task force with India’s Semiconductor Mission, the India Electronics Semiconductor Association (IESA) and the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) to promote the development of semiconductor ecosystems.

Milwaukee went nearly seven minutes between made field goals in the fourth period, and Charlotte steadily whittled down what had been a 17-point Bucks lead with less than seven minutes remaining to five points with just over a minute to go. Foul shooting proved to be enough for Milwaukee to keep the Hornets at bay, as the Bucks went 5-of-6 at the line in the final 1:14. Charlotte went cold after cutting the deficit to 5 points. Mason Plumlee, whose final 2 points on a 14-point, 14-rebound night pulled the Hornets within 118-113 with 1:06 left, missed a would-be and-one free-throw attempt but gathered his final rebound on the carom. Jalen McDaniels missed a three-point attempt on the ensuing possession that would have made it a one-possession game, and PJ Washington committed a foul that effectively ended the rally.

https://www.rappler.com/business/boeing-delivers-last-747-saying-goodbye-queen-skies-january-2023/,[],"SEATTLE, USA – Boeing bid farewell to the iconic 747, delivering the final plane to Atlas Air on Tuesday afternoon, January 31, and marking an end of an era when the first-ever “jumbo jet” ruled the skies. Thousands of Boeing employees – including some of the so-called “Incredibles” who developed the jet in the 1960s – watched the last delivery of the historic plane, which brought air travel to the masses and represented an indelible slice of Americana. The event at the mammoth manufacturing plant was capped off by a celebrity appearance by John Travolta, who recounted learning to fly the 747-400 as an ambassador for Qantas Airlines. “[It was] the toughest program that any commercial pilot will ever have to endure,” said Travolta, who called the jet the “most well thought out and safest aircraft ever built.” Known as the “Queen of the Skies,” the 747 was the world’s first twin-aisle jetliner, which Boeing designed and built in 28 months and Pan Am introduced in 1970. “It’s the airplane that redefined the industry and redefined air travel,” said Guy Norris, co-author of Boeing 747: Design and Development Since 1969. British billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, who was inspired to start an airline with a single Boeing 747 after getting stuck on a delayed flight, earlier on Tuesday called it a “wonderful beast” as he bid farewell. Boeing’s Everett, Washington, facility has been the 747’s production site since the plane’s conception. Built in 1967 to produce the mammoth jet, it remains the world’s largest manufacturing plant according to Boeing. But after five decades, customer demand for the 747 eroded as Boeing and Airbus developed more fuel efficient two-engine widebody planes. When Boeing confirmed in July 2020 that it would end 747 production, it was already only producing at a rate of half an aircraft a month. Boeing delivered five 747s in 2022, while in 1990, the peak delivery year of the bestselling 747-400 version, Boeing delivered 70 747s. As different sections of the last 747 – the wings or fuselage structures, for example – were complete, the production line “just slowly started to shut down,” said Kim Smith, Boeing’s vice president and general manager for the 747 and 767 programs. Smith said all 747 program workers were transferred to other jobs or voluntarily retired. The last 747 rolled out on December 7, capping the program at 1,574 total. The plane has since completed inspections and flight tests, flying to Portland over the holidays to get a paint job. The plane will fly off on Wednesday morning, February 1, to Atlas’ headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. While Boeing also builds the 767 and 777 in Everett, the company has yet to decide which program will permanently take over the 747 production bay, which is currently being used for 787 inventory and 777X work, Smith said. Boeing will remain tied to the 747 through the aftermarket business and the Air Force One replacement program, which Boeing won in 2018. The heir apparent to the 747, the 777X, will not be ready for delivery until 2025, but Boeing chief executive David Calhoun focused his goodbye on that future: “The 777, the next plane to dominate this space, displaced all its competition just like that – and we haven’t even introduced the best version.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/protests-myanmar-coup-anniversary-february-1-2023/,[],"Protesters marked the two-year anniversary of Myanmar’s military coup with a “silent strike” in major cities and rallies overseas on Wednesday, February 1, as exiled civilian leaders vowed to end what they called the army’s “illegal power grab.” The Southeast Asian country’s top generals led a putsch on February 2021 after five years of tense power-sharing under a quasi-civilian political system created by the military. The overthrow of the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi derailed a decade of reform, international engagement and economic growth, while leaving a trail of upended lives in its wake. Myanmar has been in chaos since the coup, with a resistance movement fighting the military on multiple fronts after a bloody crackdown on opponents that saw Western sanctions reimposed. Myanmar’s military is due to issue a statement on Wednesday that may decide whether to extend a state of emergency, ahead of a promised poll this year that critics call a sham aimed at retaining power in the country. The army’s National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) met on Tuesday, January 31, where it discussed the situation in Myanmar including the actions of the National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow administration formed by opponents, and the so-called people’s defense force fighting the army, state media reported. “The unusual circumstances of the country whereby they are making attempts to seize state power in an insurgent and terror-like ways (was discussed),” the military-owned Myawaddy media said on Tuesday. Myawaddy reported the NDSC planned to release the “necessary statement” on February 1, without giving further details. A telephone call to a military spokesperson seeking comment was not answered. Myanmar’s military took power after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by Suu Kyi’s party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud. The junta, led by Min Aung Hlaing, says its crackdown is a legitimate campaign against “terrorists.” It declared a state of emergency for a year when it took power and has since extended it twice for six months, with the latest phase expiring on Wednesday. The constitution allows for two extensions, though some sections appear to give more flexibility on the issue. “For two years, the people of Myanmar have stood together, their heads held high, and steadfastly resisted Min Aung Hlaing and the Myanmar military’s attempt to overthrow the elected government,” the NUG said in a statement. The NUG added that “together with ethnic allies, who have opposed the military for decades, we will end the military’s illegal power grab.” In the main commercial cities of Yangon and Mandalay, images on social media showed deserted streets in what coup opponents said was a silent protest against the junta. In Thailand, hundreds of protesters held a rally outside the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, while activists also staged a protest in the Philippine’s capital, Manila. “We are the people, we have the future,” protesters in Bangkok chanted. “The revolution must prevail.” The United States and allies including the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada imposed further sanctions on Myanmar on Tuesday, with curbs on energy officials and junta members, among others. In Japan, a major donor and investor before the coup, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno on Wednesday urged the military government to restore the democratic political system. The junta has pledged to hold an election in August this year. State media recently announced tough requirements for parties to contest, a move that critics say could sideline the military’s opponents and cement its grip on politics. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party was decimated by the coup, with thousands of its members arrested or jailed, including Suu Kyi, and many more in hiding. It has described this year’s planned election as “phony” and said it would not acknowledge it. The election has also been dismissed as a sham by Western governments. “You cannot have a free and fair election when you arrest, detain, torture and execute leaders of the opposition,” UN special rapporteur on Myanmar Tom Andrews told reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced and over 70,000 have left the country, according to the United Nations, which has accused the military of war crimes and crimes against humanity. – Rappler.com"

Davao Oriental provincial board member Rotchie Ravelo, a former provincial agriculturist, said, “With our small budget, it is so expensive to run it.” The Cateel irrigation system was built nine years ago to aid rice farmers. Also known as the Aragon Dam, it was designed to water 4,000 hectares of rice fields, but currently serves only 1,600 hectares due to damage to its right canal. The provincial government’s technical team stated that the dam’s optimal economic life is only five years, making it necessary for the NIA to take over. Edito Sumile, the provincial agriculturist, said, “To really make it functional and cover an area of 4,000 hectares, it will really require a huge amount, beyond the capacity of the province to shoulder for now.” The province’s budget for 2023 is some P2.3 billion, a decrease from 2022’s more than P2.7 billion, said Vice Governor Nino Sotero Uy. The capitol’s annual revenue decline was further compounded by the economic impact of COVID-19, officials said. “Delaying the repair and turnover of the Cateel irrigation project would also delay progress in this area,” said Abel James Monteagudo, the director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in the Davao Region. Malanyaon said the transfer of the project, which she referred to as her legacy, was necessary for the best interest of local farmers and the province’s goal of achieving food security. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/white-house-statement-exxon-mobil-earnings-report-2022/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – The White House on Tuesday, January 31, expressed outrage at Exxon Mobil Corporation‘s record net profit in 2022 of $56 billion, a historical high not just for the company but for the entire Western oil industry. Oil majors are expected to break their own annual records due to high prices and soaring demand, pushing their combined take to near $200 billion. The scale has brought renewed criticism of the oil industry and sparked calls for more countries to levy windfall profit taxes on the companies. A White House statement said Exxon’s profit margin was particularly galling as Americans paid record-high prices at the pump. It criticized attempts by Republicans in the House of Representatives to push policies aimed at supporting the oil industry. “The latest earnings reports make clear that oil companies have everything they need, including record profits and thousands of unused but approved permits, to increase production, but they’re instead choosing to plow those profits into padding the pockets of executives and shareholders while House Republicans manufacture excuse after excuse to shield them from any accountability,” the White House said. President Joe Biden has blasted oil companies and refiners for much of the last year for enjoying surging profits as gasoline prices soared. In June, he wrote to executives of major oil refiners and complained they had cut back on production to pad profits, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters. Exxon’s chief financial officer Kathryn Mikells responded to growing criticism over the industry’s windfall profits and suggested the answer is not increased taxes. “We look at the EU tax on the energy sector, and you know, it’s just unlawful and bad policy trying to tax something, when what you actually need is for it to increase,” Mikells said. “It has the opposite effect of what you’re trying to achieve.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/how-quark-henares-adapted-viral-twitter-thread-dark-comedy/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"SAN DIEGO, United States – I interviewed Quark Henares virtually while he was in snowy Park City, Utah. He was, surprisingly, wearing a thin, plain blue shirt, while I was in California, bundled up in multiple layers of clothing. Warmly received, though, was his film, Marupok AF (Where Is The Lie?), which premiered at the Treasure Mountain Inn Ballroom as a part of the Breakout Features Program of the 2023 Slamdance Film Festival. As Esquire Philippines’s 2022 Creative of the Year awardee, Henares definitely knows a thing or two about the film industry. His role as the head of Globe Studios, now ANIMA, would see him executive produce a range of different films, supporting avant-garde visions like Lav Diaz’s Ang Panahon ng Halimaw (Season of the Devil), crowd-pleasing fanfare such as LSS (Last Song Syndrome), and indie darlings such as last year’s Leonor Will Never Die. His new position as the Head of Originals, Philippines, at Prime Video & Amazon Studios further solidifies his place as one of the premier exponents of Filipino cinema. Just last week, Amazon Prime made a huge move in acquiring In My Mother’s Skin, which will premiere on the streaming platform later this year. “When Bianca [Balbuena] told me [In My Mother’s Skin] got in [to Sundance], I was like, ‘Panood nga (Let me watch),’” Henares shared. “It was unanimous among the whole team that, ‘Man, we have to take this film.’” But, lest it be forgotten, Henares is also a fine director himself. He directed witty and comical films such as Keka (2003) and the timeless local classic Rakenrol (2011), which Quentin Tarantino called “a hell of a lot of fun.” Now, he returns to the director’s chair to tell a swirling story of catfishing, inspired by the true story of trans woman Jzan Tero, as recounted in a Twitter thread. “I’d been so firmly placed behind desks for seven years that I forgot what it was actually like to be in my favorite place in the world: behind the camera.” Marupok AF (Where Is The Lie?) represents a labor of love brought about by constant rewrites, unexpected castings, and new perspectives. It’s a playful film with countless twists and turns that you’d be hard-pressed to imagine actually happened (but it did). EJ Jallorina stars as Janzen Torres, a hopeless romantic who unexpectedly finds love when she matches with the charming, seemingly perfect Theo Balmaceda (Royce Cabera) on a dating app. However, her hopes are crushed when Theo fails to show up for their planned meet-up, drawing her into a complex web of deception and lies orchestrated by the manipulative and sociopathic Beanie Landridos (Maris Racal). I talked to Quark about his directing and writing process, the casting of his main leads, and how this particular catfishing story has connected with a Gen Z audience and opened up discussions about trans rights issues. Let’s set the scene. March 29, 2020. Jzan Tero released the-now viral Twitter thread that gripped the nation involving a very meticulously planned catfishing story. Do you remember where you were at that time and what your reaction was to it? Yes, I remember where I was, and I remember where everyone was at that time. We were all at home, it was the height of lockdown. I remember it was Week 3, and how every week, may (there was) something. In the very first version of this film, si Janzen has a monologue and says basically: “In the beginning, March 2020, Duterte locked the Philippines down, nobody was allowed to go out, and the only thing bonding everyone together was chismis (gossip).” And I remember there was always the chismis of the week. Week 1 was Cat Arambulo, then Week 2 was Koko Pimentel, and then Week 3 was the catfishing incident. It was 2 am, and I had just finished watching a movie. I just saw Twitter ablaze, and then I was like, “Ano ‘to, ano ‘tong (What is this) ‘I got catfished?’” And then I remembered really reading it, and it was like 3:30 am when I finished. We cut and pasted everything, and it was 19 pages long; the whole thing was 19 pages long, single-spaced. And I just remembered talking to the creative director of ANIMA and basically saying there’s a story here, there’s really something that can be told and felt. I wanna ask about the casting process, what made you want to cast EJ, Maris, and Royce for the film? And did you already have them in your mind beforehand? No, we didn’t have anyone in mind. In fact, we had a long list of people for Beanie, and Maris really wasn’t one of them because if you look at her filmography, diba palagi siyang (isn’t she always like the) best friend of the lead in a rom-com and she’s always wholesome in films like The Breakup Playlist and Block Z. She’s always like the happy-girl character, so Maris wasn’t actually in our radar. And then, so when Maris finally read, I was blown away. We wrote Beanie to be more of a toughie and bully. One of the things we had her do during the audition was, “Okay, insult everyone in the room, including me.” And she destroyed everyone. The way she did it was like, “Ganda naman ng suot mo, hindi halata galing sa Rustans,” parang ganoon, “or galing sa Landmark (“I like your outfit, it doesn’t look like it comes from Rustans,” or “Looks like it came from Landmark).” She was smiling while doing that, and then I was like, “Oh my god, this is the character.” This is what Beanie should be, this very playful and impish character. For the Janzen role, we didn’t wanna pull off The Danish Girl or Dallas Buyers Club, we really wanted a trans actress. In fact, si Rod Singh, from Drag Den Philippines, who’s one of the creative consultants of the film, actually directed the love scene. We had EJ go to audition, and then she said a “Do you feel old now” moment to me. EJ was like, “Hi Kuya Quark, do you remember me?” And I’m like, “Ha, ano (What)? I don’t remember you.” And then she went like, “I was one of the child actors in Bagong Buwan.” Because I was a PA in Bagong Buwan, my job was to wrangle the kids and take care of them. So we had an immediate bond after that. She’s great, she’s an artist, a photographer. I mean, she’s really got this sensitive soul. And then, Royce, we wanted someone happy-go-lucky na medyo (who’s kind of a) bimbo, and the thing about Royce when watching Fuccbois and other stuff, there’s something behind the dumb jock look with him. There was a vulnerability. This film went through Full Circle Lab, right? How many rounds of edits did it go through? What was the most significant change it underwent? My gosh, you will not recognize the first cut if you watch it. One of the mentors is the editor of Triangle of Sadness, and when we wrote it, John Bedia, my co-writer, and I wrote it like Rashomon. So the first part was Janzen, more of John’s writing, basically like a romantic comedy. Janzen falls in love, and then she chats with Theo, and then the twist is only revealed in the end. Then, Theo is the second part. The anchor for Theo was the interview with the Tulfo-type character, and then you see how Theo was in male pageants and how Beanie lured him and started abusing him as his boss. And then, finally, the third part was Beanie. All three parts were shot completely differently, and you can still kind of see that in the movie where Janzen’s story was more of a rom-com, Theo’s was more of a Cinemalaya, social-realist type, and then Beanie was more of a Gone Girl type, with the long-takes and everything. We workshopped the film with a lot of different writers and directors, not just the first cut. We had the skeleton of both versions already, and the mentors were like, the second cut is the better version. Marie Jamora, my best friend who came to Slamdance to watch it, said, “Oh my gosh, this is so much better.” But until now, I still weep for the Rashomon version (laughter). The film is branded as a dark comedy, and this decision is obviously informed by having a deeply unsympathetic point of view character in Beanie. What made you want to latch onto the perspective of the catfisher? When reading the thread, I was like, “Why would people do that?” And it’s more than just, “Why would they be so mean?” because they bought her an expensive dinner, Beanie got Janzen a room in a hotel overnight, and she never conned Janzen off money, she never had any financial gain from it. And also, I guess what separates this from any other catfishing movie or story is parang siyang (it’s like an) organized effort, it was really like making a movie. You had a person for the voice, a person for the video, and a person for the pictures. So number one, the logistics of it, and number two, what the motivation was, and then number three, the obsession, because looking at the thread, there were many times where Beanie could’ve stopped, but she just kept on going. She ghosted her already at the airport, and then biglang (suddenly), “No, no, no, let’s keep it going. Let’s have her come to Manila.”  And then, after brineakan na siya ni (she was broken up with by) Theo, she still kept on going. That was what we wanted to understand. And, of course, Jzen was so helpful, and we had a two-hour conversation with her on Zoom. Even on set, I would text her, “Jzen, paano ‘to (how do we do this)?” and ask for advice while shooting. But, the perpetrator was the big question mark. And then, talking about Rashomon version, we really wanted to give all three of them equal footing, but it was the Triangle of Sadness editor who said that Beanie should be the protagonist. She is the interesting one. Of course, we all felt a bit of guilt. Kren Yap, one of my producers, is a trans male and, you know, one of ANIMA’s many advocacies, with Gaya Sa Pelikula and our films, is promoting LGBTQ+ advocacies. So we were like, “Do we really wanna make the aggressor the bida (the protagonist)?” So it was really another hurdle we had to get over. Speaking of that, the film also brings attention to other cases of trans rights issues, like the Pemberton case and discrimination in bathrooms. Can you tell me why you think Janzen and Beanie’s story in the film has been able to connect with people and become a conversation starter for these issues? Talking to Jzen, one small detail John and I found very interesting was that she wasn’t really political. She’s just a girl living her life. We workshopped it also in a Sundance workshop last year, and the participants said, “We love that she has a mother who loves her, and it’s not a transition story, and that’s a good, different detail that sets Janzen apart from a lot of other trans characters.” What’s interesting is that when she was attacked, when she was bullied and catfished, biglang (suddenly), the whole community came out. They all cut ties with the catfisher, and they all came out to protect Jzen. I mean everybody, the gay community, the lesbian community, and what was so nice and touching about that was you don’t have to be political as a person, but when you need them, the community is there. They will appear and protect you. That was so touching for us. That’s why the post-script was so important. We could’ve ended earlier, but we still wanted to show the awakening of Janzen’s character. Parang, this is not gonna end, she can’t just keep her mouth shut. She can’t just keep not talking and enjoying her life. She has to speak up, she has to fight. John was like, “Oh my god, my favorite movie is Orapronobis,” and ‘yun nga nangyari sa ending (that is what happened in the end), this awakening to revolution. So I wanna talk about Maris. Maris, as Beanie, is just super charismatic and unexpectedly layered in that you depict her as having a sense of sympathy for Janzen. In the thread, I thought that wasn’t immediately available to readers, so why did you want to add that sympathy? I think making the movie really was an inquiry, an attempt to understand. And at the end of the day, we can’t really understand the aggressor. But we did put in a few possible things. Number one, of course, is the control. I’m the director, this is my story, and then this is my behind-the-scenes, like I’m the boss here. The other one was the sexual frustration, like it wasn’t sensual for Beanie, there was an anger in it. Another one was obsession, she just kept on wanting to push it because she never thought she’d get caught. Maybe it was also internalized homophobia, maybe she’s angry at herself and afraid to admit that she herself has these sorts of feelings. A loose comparison would be like the Joker, yung “Do you know where I got these scars?” So telling a story, and then the next time, he tells it like it’s a different story. It’s enough mystery wherein you’re not sure talaga (really). And Maris played it really so well. She blew us away every time. This film is very Gen Z. It adapts a Twitter thread — very inspired by the film Zola — and there are TikToks, online buzzwords, and a pandemic setting near the end. So, aside from the Gen Z sector being a big sector of the moviegoing public, why do you want to focus on this particular generation as the audience for this film? I didn’t naman ever set out to make a Gen Z movie, but I think a lot of what happened, such as displaying every aspect of your life on social media, it just so happened that this is Gen Z. I didn’t want this to make a judgment on Gen Z, but I wanted to make a judgment on that generally. How every aspect of our life, even the most painful stuff, has to be on display. Sometimes, it can be very cathartic and, I guess, confessional. And then other times, it can be treating this fake version of yourself. Even in the way they shot themselves, si Janzen, very raw and bad TikTok effects, and then Beanie had production design and para siyang (it’s like a) Netflix documentary. So, that was something we were trying to capture. I think it was one of the readers from Full Circle Lab who said, “This generation, they keep falling into traps, and then they keep trying to dig themselves out of traps, and then kind of going deeper sometimes.” I don’t think that’s a proper generalization of Gen Z, but I do feel that a lot of people in their early-20s, starting out with their jobs and finishing college today, tend to do that. Here’s a “Chika Minute” question: Are there still people like Beanie in the local industry? You don’t have to name them, but if there are, what would your message be to them? You know what? There definitely are. I hear about them, and there are definitely homophobes, there are definitely transphobic people. What’s good about the film industry, though, is it’s very diverse, and there are a lot of allies. What we always want to do is kind of like create a safe environment on set because that’s when people feel like, “Okay, I can really play. I can really be myself. I can really spread my wings.” I don’t ever want it to be, “Oh, you act this way.” It’s always nice when it’s a collaboration, and my favorite kinds of films are really those where you feel the fun they had on set, and you can feel it ooze from the screen. So I guess, not only for those filmmakers but also for those who work with them, be aware of your power, that you can speak up, and that people will always back you up. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-do-not-say-misogyny-language/,[],"On what should have been a boring Wednesday morning, TikToker and trans activist Jeffrey Marsh wakes up to a death threat. Jeffrey is posting videos about trans identities and acceptance on TikTok, and uses words like “non-binary” and “cis gendered,” giving linguistic expression to experiences that previously have had no language. It’s enough for someone to want them dead. In another part of the United States, on a hot day in June, right-wing commentator Matt Walsh is faced with a threat to his life so plausible that he is prompted to call the police. It comes at the heels of his documentary What is a Woman, where he ties the definition of “woman” to biological traits and questions the validity of trans experiences. He uses terms like “gender ideology” and “the Left,” speaking to his followers about what he perceives to be indoctrination, far removed from biological reality. The documentary is enough to make someone want him dead. Both Marsh and Walsh are considered by many as a voice for good. But how can we hear either of them when we live in a world so polarized, we no longer speak the same language? This isn’t an essay about trans rights or what it means to be a woman. It is an essay about how language shapes the way we see each other, and language reaches far beyond the trans debate. From “mask hysteria” to “ableism,” expressions not only affect our perception of the phenomenon described; they affect what we think of the person making the statement. They place this person squarely inside a group of people we already have an opinion about. Such stock phrases do not represent a neutral description of reality; they enhance a part of it from a specific point of view; they take a polemic position and make moral judgements based on this position. And we reach for them instinctively, almost like a shield against our opponent’s opinions: “#Sexist!” When left-leaning people like me encounter phrases like “fake news” or “deep state,” we stop listening. These expressions strip away any curiosity we might have had about the argument. They feel like a gimmick, a weapon, void of any content. Yet we fall into the same trap when we make our own case, prompting opponents to roll their eyes, or worse, to dismiss everything we have to say from then on. That is why “misogyny” won’t make Megxit-criticizers believe in the plight of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle any more than “sustainability” will inspire republicans to live eco-friendly lives. Back on YouTube, Matt Walsh makes it clear that death threats do not deter him. If anything, they make him more radicalized. But as he blasts his distaste for the “gay agenda” on every platform, all we hear is a close-minded right winger unable to appreciate the full spectrum of human experiences, who misinterprets our insistence as indoctrination. Jeffrey Marsh, meanwhile, fills his TikTok with come backs to his “cis gendered” attackers, and all they see is a naïve show-off who blindly repeats the libs’ fancy new vocabulary. The problem is that these words aren’t arguments; they are, at best, the result of a line of arguments that we have skipped. When we use these expressions, we avoid explaining why we think what we think. We take for granted the existence of a “patriarchy” but will not bring our opponents to that realization by banging the word on the table. In the same way, we’re not inclined to believe in a “deep state” simply because we hear it often. And even if we take the time to explain the meaning of “sustainability,” it is likely that our opponent has stopped taking us seriously the minute that word has left our lips. Granted, we should all say what we mean and express ourselves in a way that feels natural. But let us stop and think why we participate in a debate. Is it to exchange ideas? Is it to gain insight into someone else’s world view? Is it so that harmful ideas will not stand unopposed? Or is it to convince the opponent of our own point of view? Whatever the case, it is worthwhile to look for alternative words which might justify, and thereby render superfluous, our loaded stock phrases. Instead of stating that “the patriarchy is alive and well,” we could say that we are living in a society where most of the power lies in the hands of adult men, and this is what we wish to challenge. Clearly this is both mentally taxing and time consuming; we are forcing ourselves to be specific and transparent, making it easier for the opponent to bring counter arguments. We may also have to back up our claims with facts. And when we articulate our opinions in different words, we might realize that our understanding of something was fuzzy, or that connections we thought we saw, do not exist. So, if our motivation for debate participation is more than to receive simple accolades from our echo chamber [another stock phrase], we’d be well advised not to push people away with verbal daggers, because we know in our hearts that they might read our argument to its end if they never came across the word “mansplaining,” like we would theirs if we never came across “woke.” I write this, not because I want to silence or “polish” people like Jeffrey Marsh, or to suggest that the hatred they receive is caused by their language. I write it because I want them to have a voice, and to be taken seriously by people who might not otherwise listen to them. But I also write it because I want people like Matt Walsh to keep participating in our public debate. Few things are more dangerous than extremist views gone underground. But if we’re going to argue with him, we must speak the same language. – Rappler.com Margrete Dyvik Cardona is an Associate Professor of Spanish Linguistics at the NHH Norwegian School of Economics.

https://www.rappler.com/business/indians-support-billionaire-gautam-adani-battle-short-seller-hindenburg-research/,[],"NEW DELHI, India – Many Indians voiced their support for Gautam Adani on Tuesday, January 31, as the school dropout-turned-billionaire sealed a $2.5-billion share sale in the face of criticism from a US short-seller. #IndiaStandsWithAdani was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter in response to losses totaling $65 billion for Adani Group stocks since last week’s Hindenburg Research report, which flagged concerns over its debt levels and use of tax havens. “I am proud of my country’s billionaire. Indians will not get fooled…. India will not bend in front of any foreign power,” tweeted Mukund Jethava, a member of the IT unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat state. Support online mirrored financial backing for Adani Enterprises, which despite having 30% anchor bids for its share sale last week had only amassed 3% subscriptions by Monday, January 30, in the public offering, amid concerns it could fail. But in the event, the 60-year-old’s firm managed to seal the deal before the market closed on Tuesday, thanks to support of corporate and institutional investors, even though the price of Adani Enterprises stock was lower than the share sale offer. Although smaller retail investors did not bid as much, posts with hashtags online included #IndiaINCSupportsAdani and #AdaniFPOFullySubscribed and were among the top trending on the social media platform, praising the billionaire. On Sunday, January 29, Adani issued a detailed rebuttal to Hindenburg, calling the short-seller’s research report a “calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.” Hindenburg has said Adani’s response largely confirmed its findings and “ignored” its key questions, adding that it “found Adani’s lack of direct and transparent answers” on the allegations of use of offshore entities “telling.” Adani Group’s chief financial officer, Jugeshinder Singh, has likened the participation of Indian investors in the recent sell-off to the colonial-era Jallianwala Bagh massacre by British officials. Asked why the market believed the Hindenburg report, Adani’s CFO had said: “In Jallianwala Bagh, only one Englishman gave an order, and Indians fired on other Indians…. So am I surprised by the behavior of some fellow Indians? No.” Twitter buzzed with various memes questioning the Hindenburg report on Tuesday, and others praised the performance of the Adani Group after the secondary share sale was fully subscribed. “We all are sons of soil and this is once again proven to be true. The indian biz diaspora has stood alongside Adani to weather the storm created by outsiders. #IndiaINCSupportsAdani,” trader Himanshu Hirpara said on Twitter. Another Twitter user said “World Powers are afraid Due to India’s GDP growing, we’re becoming a soft global power.” The fundraising was critical for Adani, not just because it will help cut his group’s debt, but also because it was seen by some as a gauge of confidence at a time when the tycoon faces one of his biggest business and reputational challenges. Amid all the praise, however, some flagged caution. “Investors lined up for $2.5 bln despite $66 bln wipeout? Hmm…the #HindenburgReport remains in the public domain and the can of worms is out there,” said Sanjay Jha, a former spokesperson of India’s opposition Congress party. – Rappler.com"

Dennis Schroder hit the tiebreaking three-pointer with 3:14 left in overtime to start a decisive 7-0 run by the Lakers, who snapped a two-game losing streak. James, who missed Los Angeles’ Monday defeat to the Brooklyn Nets with a sore left ankle and left foot, finished with 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds. He now has 38,299 points in his career, 89 points shy of breaking Abdul-Jabbar’s record. James’ eighth and ninth assists of the game – leading to Troy Brown Jr.’s three-pointer and a dunk by Thomas Bryant on consecutive possessions early in the fourth quarter – vaulted James past Mark Jackson (10,334 assists) and Steve Nash (10,335 assists) into fourth place on the all-time list. James ended the night at 10,338. Jalen Brunson scored a game-high 37 points for the Knicks, who have lost two straight and six of eight. Anthony Davis contributed 27 points and 9 rebounds for the Lakers, while Rui Hachimura finished with 19 points.

However, it was the first time I heard of vegan shawarma rice, so I had to try Shirley’s Just Vegan’s plant-based version of the popular Middle Eastern dish. The local business serves it just like in mainstream stalls – a plate of brightly-colored java rice, generous slices of “meat,” fresh veggies, and a yogurt sauce drizzled on top. The only difference is that it’s “beaf” used – a meat-free substitute made with textured vegetable protein and spices. It’s got a firm, solid chew (none of that mushy texture) and a subtle umami flavor. The “yogurt sauce” used is also a vegan mayo substitute, which adds a nice creaminess to the dish. The rice is tasty, and the freshly-sliced onions, tomato, and cucumber add a zing of freshness. It’s a whole meal on its own, and a satisfying one at that! Also, this vegan dish got some impressed “this isn’t meat?” comments from my non-vegetarian friends. Other ingredients include vegetable oil, turmeric, annatto paste, salt, pepper, and soy sauce. You can also opt for a spicy version using sriracha vegan mayo. Shirley’s Just Vegan’s vegan shawarma rice costs P250 for a solo meal and P1,100 for a tray that’s good for 3-4 people.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/intel-slashes-employee-executive-pay/,[],"Intel Corp said on Tuesday, January 31, that it had made broad cuts to employee and executive pay, a week after the company issued a lower-than-expected sales forecast driven by a loss of market share to rivals and a PC market downturn. The reductions will range from 5% of base pay for mid-level employees to as much as 25% for Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, while the company’s hourly workforce’s pay will not be cut, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Intel spokesperson Addy Burr said in a statement that the “changes are designed to impact our executive population more significantly and will help support the investments and overall workforce.” Intel last week said its profit margins were plunging as the PC market cools after several years of growth during the pandemic. Gelsinger also conceded that Intel has “stumbled” and lost market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc, which on Tuesday reported quarterly sales that were above Wall Street’s expectations. The person familiar with Intel’s pay cuts said that in addition to 5% decreases for mid-level employees, vice president level employees will see 10% reductions and the company’s top executives other than the CEO will get 15% cuts. The company has also lowered its 401(k) matching program from 5% to 2.5% and suspended merit raises and quarterly performance bonuses, the person said. Annual performance bonuses based Intel’s overall financial performance will remain but those bonuses have been smaller in recent years as the company has lost ground to rivals, the person added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/austin-manila-visit-bring-deal-expanded-base-access/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s visit to the Philippines this week is expected to bring an announcement of expanded US access to military bases in the country, a senior Philippines official said on Wednesday, February 1. Washington is eager to extend its security options in the Philippines as part of efforts to deter any move by China against self-ruled Taiwan, while Manila wants to bolster defense of its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Austin arrived in Manila on Tuesday night, and will meet his Philippine counterpart and other officials on Thursday “to build on our strong bilateral relationship, discuss a range of security initiatives, and advance our shared vision of a free and open Pacific,” he said on Twitter. On Wednesday morning, Austin visited US troops stationed at a Philippine military camp in the southern city of Zamboanga, according to Roy Galido, commander of the Western Mindanao Command. “Our working relationship to them is very strong,” Galido told reporters, adding that US troops help in counter terrorism, and humanitarian and disaster response missions. US officials have said Washington hopes for an access agreement during Austin’s visit, which began on Tuesday, and that Washington has proposed additional sites under an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) dating back to 2014. (READ: EDCA implementation a missing piece in PH-US defense ties – expert) “There’s a push for another four or five of these EDCA sites,” the a senior Philippines official said. “We are going to have definitely an announcement of some sort. I just don’t know how many would be the final outcome of that.” The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Manila and Washington have a mutual defense treaty and have been discussing US.access to four additional bases on the northern land mass of Luzon, the closest part of the Philippines to Taiwan, as well as another on the island of Palawan, facing the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. EDCA allows US access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence. The U.S. military already has access to five such sites. The Philippines official said increased US access needed to benefit both countries. “We don’t want it to be directed to just for the use of the United States purely for their defense capabilities…it has to be mutually beneficial,” he said. “And obviously, we want to make sure that no country will see…anything that we’re doing…was directed towards any conflict or anything of that sort,” he added. Manila’s priorities in its agreements with Washington were to boost its defense capabilities and interoperability with US forces and to improve its ability to cope with climate change and natural disasters, the official said. He said that after cancelling an agreement for the purchase of heavy-lift helicopters from Russia last year, Manila had reached a deal with Washington to upgrade “a couple” of Blackhawk helicopters that could be used for disaster relief. “The deal with Russia was very attractive because for a certain budget we were able to get something like 16 of these heavy-lift helicopters,” the official said. “Now with the United States, obviously their helicopters are more expensive, so we’re looking at how we can fit in the budget that we’ve had.” Gregory Poling, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said access to sites in northern Luzon would help US efforts to deter any Chinese move against Taiwan by putting the waters to the south of the island within range of shore-based missiles. He said the U.S. and Philippine marines were pursuing similar capabilities with ground-based rockets, with Manila’s particular interest being to protect its South China Sea claims. The Philippines is among several countries at odds with China in the South China Sea and has been angered by the constant presence of vessels in its exclusive economic zone it says are manned by Chinese militia. China is also Manila’s main trading partner. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/my-big-coin-cryptocurrency-firm-founder-prison-sentence-fraud/,[],"The founder of a defunct cryptocurrency business was sentenced on Tuesday, January 31, to more than eight years in prison for defrauding investors and customers out of millions of dollars by marketing a virtual currency called My Big Coin with lies and half-truths. Federal prosecutors had urged US District Judge Denise Casper in Boston to impose a 13-year prison term on Randall Crater to send a message to others in the first sentencing of a cryptocurrency company founder for marketing fraud. While Casper concluded that that request went too far, she rejected Crater’s contention that a 30-month prison term was sufficient to punish him for his false claims, including that My Big Coin was a real cryptocurrency backed by gold. “Certainly cryptocurrency is a newer enterprise, a newer market, a 21st Century market,” Casper said. “But the scheme at its core was age-old, and that was fraud.” Crater, who was sentenced to 100 months in total and ordered to forfeit nearly $7.7 million, is expected to appeal. In court, he apologized but said he never meant to defraud anyone. “I did not set out to steal money from anyone,” he said. “That does not mean I am not remorseful.” A jury in July found Crater, 52, guilty of committing wire fraud and making unlawful monetary transactions in a prosecution that spilled out of a precedent-setting case by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC’s 2018 lawsuit against Crater and his failed company, Nevada-based My Big Coin Inc, led to one of the first court rulings holding that a virtual currency could be considered a commodity within the regulator’s jurisdiction. Prosecutors subsequently secured Crater’s indictment in 2019 and accused him of causing investors and customers to lose $7.5 million from 2014 to 2017 with lies about My Big Coin, whose name sounded similar to the popular virtual currency bitcoin. Prosecutors said those false claims included that My Big Coin was a real virtual currency, was backed by gold and had a partnership with MasterCard MA.N. Prosecutors said he used the money to buy cars, jewelry, artwork and antique coins. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/sandiganbayan-decision-marcoses-retaking-forfeited-assets/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Sandiganbayan, the country’s anti-graft court, barred the Marcos family from retaking their assets that were already declared part of their ill-gotten wealth. In a 40-page resolution dated January 25, the court’s Third Division said the family of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. cannot regain control of all the forfeited wealth, including companies and land holdings, earlier surrendered in favor of the government. “The Court dismissed the Third Amended Complaint with respect to the properties that ‘have already been recovered by the government or transferred to third persons not involved herein’, or those which have been the subject of court decisions and compromise agreements as the same were barred by res judicata …[based on] conclusiveness of judgment and mootness. Thus, the Court can no longer rule on the said properties,” the anti-graft court ruled. The resolution was penned by Associate Justice Michael Frederick L. Musngi, with the concurrence of Associate Justices Maria Thesesa V. Mendoza-Arcega and Maryann E. Corpus-Mañalac. Since the Sandiganbayan has decide with finality, the Marcos family cannot bring to the court the issue of ownership. The Sandiganbayan’s ruling stemmed from the petitions filed by former first lady Imelda Marcos, wife of the late dictator, and daughter Irene Marcos-Araneta. The ruling denied the prayer for the issuance of a writ of execution in the Omnibus Motion dated August 10, 2022 and a Supplement dated August 17, 2022. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the government’s primary legal counsel, assailed the Marcos family’s motion, citing the pending Petition for Review of Certiorari filed on August 10, 2022. The OSG also invoked the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in 2012, which affirmed the finding that the evidence collected established a prima facie presumption that the properties were ill-gotten. Prima facie means “based on first impression” and that the legal claim used has sufficient evidence upon initial examination. The OSG also assailed the evidence submitted by the Marcos family. According to the OSG, the documents attached to Constante Rubio’s testimony, among the defendants, were photocopies and cannot be used as evidence. The government also insisted that the Marcos family’s lawful income is only $304,372.43. In their petition, Imelda and Irene asked for the issuance of a writ of execution. They classified their assets into four categories: frozen accounts, assets surrendered by virtue of compromise deals, assets seized by the state, but not under the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), and those sequestered but remain under the PCGG. They based their petition on the Sandiganbayan’s 2019 ruling that dismissed a civil case against the Marcos family after the government lawyers failed to prove that the remaining assets were part of the ill-gotten wealth. Imelda and Irene also asked the court to declare the three other classifications of their properties as not ill-gotten. These include: properties listed as not sequestered, released from sequestration, and those included in cases dismissed by final judgment. They added they have a “good and valid reason” to seek execution of the decision, adding that they “suffered greatly mentally and emotionally” during that period. Mother and daughter also claimed the dissipation of the seized properties caused them “unjust and unreasonable deprivation of their proprietary rights.” The anti-graft court sided with the OSG and said the motion for the issuance of a writ of execution should be denied for lack of merit. The Sandiganbayan said the judgment has yet to be finalized because of the OSG’s pending petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court. “The same does not constitute the good reason contemplated by the Rules of Court that would rationalize the granting of their Omnibus Motion. The defendants (Marcoses) also offered no proof or reason how the properties subject of this case are being dissipated.” To avoid confusion, the anti-graft court said the properties “already recovered, transferred to third persons not included in the case, or become the subject of court Decisions and compromise agreements” are already moot and academic. The resolution also listed the following shares and properties “beyond the reach” of the Marcos family: Meanwhile, the following properties remain under the Marcos family’s control: – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/trump-fundraising-presidential-bid-modest-start-february-2023/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Donald Trump‘s bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 got off to a modest fundraising start, with his campaign ending the year with about $7 million on hand while his Save America fund had about $18 million, according to financial disclosures released on Tuesday, January 31. After launching his third consecutive run for the White House on November 15, a week after a weaker-than-expected Republican performance in midterm congressional elections, the former US president did little campaigning, not hitting the trail until this Saturday, January 28. Tuesday’s filings with the Federal Election Commission suggest that Trump’s fundraising was also sluggish, leaving him with a far smaller war chest than the more than $100 million Save America had on hand through early 2022. Trump remained a prodigious fundraiser after leaving office in January 2021, holding regular rallies in which he repeated his false claims that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud. But the Save America group that served as his main fundraising arm was registered to fund other campaigns, not Trump’s own. That poses legal problems if Trump seeks to use Save America funds on his own campaign. Last year, Save America transferred some $60 million to a pro-Trump Super PAC group which is expected to support his presidential run. The Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, has asked election regulators to probe Save America’s money transfers. Save America’s financial disclosure on Tuesday showed the group spent more than $3 million on lawyer fees in the final weeks of the 2022. Trump remains the Republican party’s most popular figure and is the only major candidate to have declared his intention to challenge Biden, who has not yet formally launched his own reelection campaign. But Trump could face challengers for the nomination, notably Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He also faces a series of legal risks, including a possible investigation into hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump on Saturday visited two early-voting states and held notably muted events. In contrast to the raucous rallies in front of thousands of devotees that Trump has held in the past, he spoke to about 200 people in South Carolina’s capitol building. In its disclosure to election regulators, Trump’s official campaign committee reported raising $3.8 million between November 15 and December 31, ending the year with $3 million in the bank. Most of that money was raised through another Trump fundraising group called the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which reported having an additional $3.8 million in the bank at the end of the year. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/girl-lost-mother-asks-will-justice-come-duterte-drug-war-victims/,['JODESZ GAVILAN'],"Editor’s Note: More than six months since Rodrigo Duterte stepped down from the presidency, thousands of orphaned children, wives, mothers, siblings, families left behind by victims of the violent war on drugs continue to relive painful memories. Coming mostly from the poorest communities across the Philippines, they pine for justice and accountability, some still pinning hopes on the International Criminal Court to investigate the killings. In this series, Rappler revisits some of those who were left behind – to listen and retell their stories – as they seek justice in the face of continuing fear and challenges post-Duterte. Third of 4 parts PART 1 | Drug war widow: Why is Duterte still free when our loved ones are dead?
PART 2 | Pain lingers as 2 brothers lost under Duterte’s drug war, 1 under Marcos MANILA, Philippines – A small house with dilapidated wood for walls in a crowded Metro Manila district may not be the ideal place to raise five children, but Dina* tried her best to make it work, even if violence crept from many dark corners of Rodrigo Duterte’s Philippines. Her husband had been in and out of jail for reasons that the family had long given up trying to understand. In their heart of hearts, they know he was a good father. But police thought he was a menace to society. The family wanted to fight for her husband’s freedom, to question why it was so easy for authorities to lock him up, but Dina had five mouths to feed. She had five young people relying on her for survival, she couldn’t waste the days away waiting for her husband to come home. For many hours daily, Dina scavenged through trash scattered along busy streets, blending in with other people who also strove to make ends meet. She pulled apart piles of discarded materials to look for things worth selling, to take home something for her children. “Napakabait po ng nanay ko, pala-kaibigan at mapagbigay sa mga kapitbahay,” Jenny, Dina’s third child, told Rappler on Monday, January 30. “Wala siyang nakakaaway.” (My mother was so kind, friendly and generous to our neighbors. She didn’t have an enemy.) While the work didn’t really bring much money, at least it put food on the table. But Dina, her daughter said, always found ways on days that scavenging yielded nothing. One night in 2016, she went out to make sure her family didn’t sleep on empty stomachs. Dina went to a friend’s house to ask for food, as she often did when times got tougher than usual. She had an empty bowl on one arm and her youngest child on the other. It would be the last time her children – the eldest then only 19 years old, the rest not even in their teens – would see their mother alive. She would fall victim to the violence that thrived under the violent war on drugs. Dina was shot dead by police during an anti-illegal drug operation, one of the people killed that night. She was just a few feet away from her friend’s house when policemen reportedly surrounded the area, leaving no place for the mother and child to elude the bullets. Then there were gunshots. Her youngest child whom she was carrying at the time of her death was injured and had to be brought to the hospital. Jenny could only recall the night with images imprinted on her 11-year-old mind back then. She remembered playing with her siblings and her mother walking out the door to find food. She remembered the hunger pangs that came with waiting, and then someone telling her the tragic news. The family heard different versions of why their mother ended up being riddled with bullets when she was just supposed to find food for the family. There were people who said Dina was in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the police operation targeted a different person. There were also rumors that she was mistaken for a drug personality who shared the same name. But for the children who were drowning in a sea of grief, one thing was clear: They had lost a mother. “Ang kuya ko halos mamatay na sa kakaiyak habang ang ate ko naman hindi na alam ang gagawin niya,” Jenny, now 17 years old, recalled. “Hindi namin alam kung bakit nila pinatay ang nanay namin kasi wala naman siyang ginagawang masama,” Jenny continued. (My eldest brother almost died crying while my sister didn’t know what to do. We didn’t know why the police killed my mother. She wasn’t doing anything bad.) Living in poverty has forced many children in the Philippines to grow up faster than most. In the aftermath of Dina’s untimely death, Jenny and her four siblings had no choice but to bravely face the world on their own. Life was hard even before they lost their mother, yes, but they knew that Dina would always find a way to ease the burden on the family. It was Dina who made sure everything would be okay. “Kahit mahirap ang buhay namin, basta importante magkakasama kami sa bahay na hinaharap iyong mga problema kasama si nanay (Even though life was hard, what was important was we were together at home, facing the problems with our mother),” she said. Their father was in prison when their mother died, so the children had to find ways to fend for themselves. The older siblings took on odd jobs available in their area, while the younger ones looked after their small home. They all pooled together whatever money they could get their hands on, even spare change, as they strove to survive without parental supervision. Jenny, who was then barely in her teenage years, started working to help augment the family’s daily budget. When luck was on her side, she’d get paid at least P150 ($2.75) for hours’ worth of work, but those days were few and far between. There were many days she’d go home with nothing. When days were rough – and there were many days like this – the children would just ask for food from other people who took pity on them. “Nahihirapan kami kasi sariling sikap na lang kami na itinaguyod ang isa’t isa,” Jenny said. “Nagtutulungan na lang kami para lamang po may makain.” (We were having difficulty because we were trying to support each other. We were just helping each other to have something to eat.) The almost seven years following their mother’s death were tough for the family. Their father was released from prison, only to get arrested again soon after. The only other adult in their life was their aunt, whose presence was as fleeting as the joy and happiness in their lives since they lost their mother. These days, Jenny lives at home with two of her younger siblings. She has taken the role of both breadwinner and homemaker, while her older brother and sister had gone on to live elsewhere. At 17, Jenny has had to make several difficult decisions regarding her and her siblings’ lives. She’d sometimes imagine what life would be like if their mother Dina were still alive, or if their father was a free person. Maybe they’d have someone to turn to when they felt lost and confused. “Hindi po namin matanggap na kami na lamang ang bubuhay sa sarili namin, napakahirap po na walang magulang kasi walang gumagabay,” she said. “Hirap po ako na dalhin itong responsibilidad sa edad ko na ito,” Jenny said. (We cannot accept that we are the ones who have to raise ourselves. It’s difficult to be without parents because we have no one to guide us. I’m having a hard time carrying this much responsibility at my age.) Jenny and her siblings are not the only ones who lost loved ones in Duterte’s war on drugs, the flagship program of the previous administration that killed thousands of people from the poorest communities. Government data showed that at least 6,252 individuals were killed by the police by May 2022, a month before Duterte left office. This number does not include those killed vigilante-style, which human rights groups estimate to be between 27,000 to 30,000. The effect of the slaughter does not disappear when the bodies are buried, nor packed in crowded apartment-style boxes in public cemeteries. It does not go away when the last tears are shed, or when a final wail is released from pent-up agony and anger as funeral attendants close the coffin. An investigation by the Philippine Human Rights Information Center in 2018 found that Duterte’s drug war pushed poor families deeper into poverty, as many of those killed were breadwinners with irregular income. Human Rights Watch, in a 2022 report, meanwhile, detailed the “harmful consequences” on children left behind by drug war victims. There were reported drastic changes triggered by psychological distress, which can last well into adulthood. Orphaned children, or even those left to be cared for by single parents, often had to drop out of school to work and support their remaining siblings. They were forced to abandon their dreams for the sake of daily survival. The lack of government support for those left behind aggravates their situation. Ever since Jenny can remember, she had always wanted to be a teacher. She couldn’t answer when asked what subject she would want to teach, but the 17-year-old said she enjoyed Filipino classes because of the stories her teacher required them read. That dream, however, has to wait indefinitely. Jenny, who’s several years behind in schooling, had to drop out due to family responsibilities and financial struggles that came after their mother’s death. “May balak po akong bumalik sa school kasi gusto ko naman mag-aral talaga, pero kapag nakaipon na siguro,” she said. “Wala talaga kaming pambili ng gamit.” (I have plans to go back to school because I really want to study, but maybe when I’ve saved enough money. We really do not have money to buy necessities.) She swears the goal is still alive despite the hardships. Jenny still daydreams of standing inside a brightly-decorated classroom, in front of students not much younger than her siblings. But at the center of her wish to be an educator is the desire to help her younger siblings, who haven’t had the chance to enter classrooms and become students. Maybe their ate (elder sister) could teach them a thing or two about reading and writing, even just inside their small wooden house. “Gusto ko sila maturuan at matulungan kaya pangarap ko maging teacher,” she said. “Pero alam ko na mahihirapan ako na abutin iyon, kaya nagsusumikap na lamang ako.” (I want to teach and help them that’s why I want to be a teacher. But I know it would be difficult for me to realize that dream, that’s why I just try my best.) Confronting the police about what happened to their mother may have crossed the minds of Jenny and her siblings, but they never acted on these thoughts primarily out of fear. Jenny recalled an instance when their family was harassed by policemen. She said the scary cops were asking for money but they had nothing to give. If things were different, if the alleged perpetrators didn’t know their home, Jenny would have dared fight them in court. But the climate of impunity demanded a whole lot more of courage, which she wasn’t sure she had enough of. “Masakit pa rin po na walang hustisya kasi iyon lamang po ang hiling ko talaga, na magkaroon ng hustisya para sa nanay ko na pinatay nila,” she said. (The absence of justice still pains us because that’s my only wish, to give justice to my mother whom they killed.) Jenny joins thousands of families left behind by drug war victims, all persistently hoping for accountability, specifically from Duterte who launched the campaign in 2016. Proceedings at the International Criminal Court (ICC) are the only ray of hope many families see as domestic mechanisms continue to fail them in their quest for justice. The ICC pre-trial chamber recently authorized the resumption of the investigation into the drug war killings, finding no genuine investigations by the government. The timetable for what will happen next remains unclear, including when ICC prosecutor Karim Khan could potentially request for the issuance of summons or warrants against perpetrators of the drug war killings. But Duterte has said he will never allow foreigners to judge him. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla – who vowed “real justice in real time” before the United Nations – said that the government will not cooperate with the ICC probe. The child whom their mother Dina was carrying when she was killed by the police is now 10 years old. It’s almost the same age as Jenny when she was forced to grow older and wiser beyond her years. Jenny said her youngest sibling, the one who was injured in the police operation, doesn’t ask a lot of questions about what happened to their mother – unlike her. “Gusto ko lamang malaman na bakit ang dami-daming namatay dahil sa mga pinaggagawa ng pulis, pero bakit parang walang pakialam ang Presidente natin ngayon?” she said. “Ang dami nilang nagawang kasalanan pero walang hustisya,” Jenny added. (I just want to know why they aren’t doing anything even if the police killed a lot of people. And why doesn’t the President seem to care? They kept on killing a lot but there’s still no justice.) – Rappler.com PART 4 | Under Marcos, can Duterte be held accountable for drug war killings? *Names have been changed for their protection *$1=P54.46"
https://www.rappler.com/business/pfizer-earnings-report-january-december-2022/,[],"Pfizer on Tuesday, January 31, forecast a bigger-than-expected drop in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment for 2023, intensifying investor concerns over demand for the products as governments cut orders and work through inventories. Chief executive Albert Bourla said that 2023 should be a “transition year” for Pfizer’s COVID products, before potentially returning to growth in 2024. Pfizer’s total annual sales crossed the $100-billion mark for the first time in 2022, driven by the more than $56 billion in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid antiviral treatment. It expects total 2023 revenue of $67 billion to $71 billion. “We are building on a significant capital position that we know how to deploy to create growth,” Bourla told analysts and investors on conference call. “We are building an R&D engine that is more productive than ever.” The company launched five new products last year and hopes to introduce as many as 14 more over the next year and a half, including a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and an mRNA flu vaccine. Pfizer shares were down slightly at $43.53. The stock had tumbled 15% this month, through the close on Monday, January 30. Citi analyst Andrew Baum said the company is struggling to escape its dependence on COVID drugs. “We see little here to change our cautious view on Pfizer’s ex-COVID business,” Baum said in a research note. The decline in COVID-related revenue is not the only headwind Pfizer is facing. The US drugmaker will lose patent protections for some big-selling drugs after 2025, including cancer treatment Ibrance and arthritis drug Xeljanz, and has said it expects to lose $17 billion in annual sales between 2025 and 2030 due to patent expirations. Pfizer has turned to acquisitions such as its $5.4-billion buyout of Global Blood Therapeutics and its $11.6-billion purchase of migraine drugmaker Biohaven to bolster its pipeline of future products. Citi’s Baum said he expects Pfizer will use the spike in revenue from its COVID products to “intensify and upscale” its efforts to buy other companies or new products to fill its pipeline. Excluding COVID-related sales, Pfizer expects 2023 revenue to grow 7% to 9%. Pfizer developed its COVID-19 vaccine with German partner BioNTech, and the companies split the profits. Pfizer forecast 2023 sales of $13.5 billion for their vaccine, below analysts’ estimates of $14.4 billion, and projected $8 billion in Paxlovid sales, short of Wall Street’s expectation of $10.33 billion. Bourla said the company expects to start selling its COVID vaccine Comirnaty through commercial channels in the United States in the second half of 2023, rather than selling the shots directly to the government. After that transition, the company hopes to roughly quadruple the US price of the vaccine. Analysts and investors have been looking for clarity on China demand for Paxlovid, where the drug is only covered by the country’s broad healthcare insurance plan until late March. Pfizer said its current 2023 forecast for sales does not assume any revenue from China after April 1, but Bourla said the company expects to offer Paxlovid in the private market there thereafter. “There is still an opportunity for a market in China which could be meaningful” outside of the country’s main insurance channels, said BMO analyst Evan Seigerman. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/united-states-allies-mark-anniversary-myanmar-coup-more-sanctions/,['MIA M. GONZALEZ'],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The United States and its allies imposed further sanctions on Myanmar on Tuesday, February 1, marking the two-year anniversary of a military coup with curbs on energy officials and junta members, among others. Washington imposed sanctions on the Union Election Commission, mining enterprises and energy officials, among others, according to a Treasury Department statement. Details of the decision were first reported by Reuters. It marks the first time the United States has targeted Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) officials under the current Myanmar sanctions program, a Treasury spokesperson said. Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom also announced sanctions. Myanmar’s top generals led a coup in February 2021 after five years of tense power-sharing under a quasi-civilian political system that was created by the military, which led to a decade of unprecedented change. Myanmar has been in chaos since the coup, with a resistance movement fighting the military on multiple fronts after a bloody crackdown on opponents that saw Western sanctions re-imposed. Tuesday’s US sanctions target the managing director and deputy managing director of MOGE, which is the junta’s single largest revenue generating state-owned enterprise, according to Treasury. Human rights advocates have called for sanctions on MOGE, but Washington has so far held back. Also designated by Washington was the Union Minister of Energy, who Treasury said represents Myanmar’s government in international and domestic energy sector engagements and manages the state-owned entities involved in the production and export of oil and gas. Mining Enterprise No 1 and Mining Enterprise No. 2, both state-owned enterprises, as well as the Union Election Commission, were also hit with sanctions by Washington. On Friday, January 27, the junta announced tough requirements for parties to contest an election planned for August, including a huge increase in their membership, a move that could sideline the military’s opponents and cement its grip on power. The election would subvert the will of the people if opponents of the military continue to be met by violence, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. “Many key political stakeholders have announced their refusal to participate in these elections, which will be neither inclusive nor representative, and which almost certainly will fuel greater bloodshed,” he said. The rules favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a military proxy stacked with former generals, which was trounced by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party in 2015 and 2020 elections. Thousands of NLD members were arrested or jailed in the coup, including Suu Kyi, and many more are in hiding. The NLD in November described this year’s election as “phoney” and said it would not acknowledge it. The election has also been dismissed as a sham by Western governments. Washington also targeted former and current Myanmar military officials, the Treasury said, accusing the Air Force of continued air strikes using Russian-made aircraft against pro-democracy forces that have killed civilians. Canada targeted six individuals and prohibited the export, sale, supply or shipment of aviation fuel in its action. Australia targeted members of the junta and a military-run company. The United Kingdom designated two companies and two people for helping supply Myanmar’s air force with aviation fuel used to carry out bombing campaigns against its own citizens. John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said that even with Tuesday’s action, the United States has still not matched stronger sanctions imposed by the European Union, particularly when it comes to natural gas revenue and banks that process foreign payments for the extractive sector. “As a result, the measures taken so far have not imposed enough economic pain on the junta to compel it to change its conduct,” Sifton said in a statement. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/chatgpt-openai-tool-detect-artificial-intelligence-generated-text/,[],"OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, has released a software tool to identify text generated by artificial intelligence, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday, February 1. ChatGPT is a free program that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, which has gained wide popularity since its debut in November, while raising concerns about copyright and plagiarism. The AI classifier, a language model trained on the dataset of pairs of human-written and AI-written text on the same topic, aims to distinguish text that is written by AI. It uses a variety of providers to address issues such as automated misinformation campaigns and academic dishonesty, the company said. In its public beta mode, OpenAI acknowledges the detection tool is very unreliable on texts under 1,000 characters, and AI-written text can be edited to trick the classifier. “We’re making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful,” OpenAI said. “We recognize that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom.” Since ChatGPT debuted in November and gained wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest US school districts, including New York City, have banned the AI chatbot over concerns that students will use the text generator to cheat or plagiarize. Others have created third-party detection tools including GPTZeroX to help educators detect AI-generated text. OpenAI said it is engaging with educators to discuss ChatGPT’s capabilities and limitations, and will continue to work on the detection of AI-generated text."
https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-stock-markets-currencies-oil-prices-january-31-2023/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – A gauge of global stocks advanced on Tuesday, January 31, as it closed out a strong month while US Treasury yields fell as investors assessed economic data and earnings reports ahead of a run of central bank policy announcements. On Wall Street, US stocks rallied and closed higher, reversing declines in equity futures after data showed labor cost growth in the fourth quarter was the smallest in a year, at 1%, even in a tight labor market. Other data showed consumer confidence eased in January, as inflation expectations for the next 12 months climbed to 6.8% from 6.6% last month. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, February 1. Investors will closely monitor comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell following the announcement for clues on the path of monetary policy. “Especially ahead of a Fed press conference, something like this equity market rally is kind of explicitly against what they want, and they have been pretty clear the market rallying on what they expect the Fed to do is counterproductive,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. “We do feel like we’ve gotten a bit ahead of ourselves here even if we are closer to the end of the Fed hiking cycle than the beginning.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 368.95 points, or 1.09%, to 34,086.04, the S&P 500 gained 58.83 points, or 1.46%, to 4,076.6, and the Nasdaq Composite added 190.74 points, or 1.67%, to 11,584.55. The S&P 500 closed up 6.2% for the month, its first January gain since 2019, while the Nasdaq surged 10.7% for its biggest percentage gain for the month of January since 2001. Interest rate announcements from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are scheduled for Thursday, February 2, with both seen as likely to hike rates by 50 bps. Markets will also grapple with a host of US economic data this week, culminating in the payrolls report for January on Friday, February 3. Investors see signs of weakening in the labor market as a key factor in bringing down high inflation. Other data this week include gauges of the manufacturing and services sectors. In addition, more than 100 S&P 500 companies, including market heavyweights Apple, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet, are scheduled to report results this week. Despite the strong equity rally, Caterpillar and McDonald’s both lost ground on Tuesday following their quarterly results. However, Exxon Mobil rose after posting a $56-billion net profit for 2022. European shares retreated ahead of the central bank meetings to end the month on a down note, but still notched their biggest January percentage gain since 2015. Economic data for the eurozone showed slight growth for the fourth quarter, but further weakness is expected this year. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.26%, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.72%. MSCI’s index was on pace for its biggest January percentage gain since 2019. Benchmark US 10-year notes were down 3.5 basis points to 3.516% in the wake of the data, after hitting a two-week high of 3.574% on Monday, January 30. In currencies, the US dollar index, poised for a fourth month of declines, fell 0.176%, with the euro up 0.22% to $1.0868. Oil prices recovered from earlier lows, as US crude settled up 1.2% at $78.87 per barrel and Brent settled at $84.49, down 0.48% on the day. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-corporate-executives-note-caution-q4-2022-earnings-outstrip-estimates/,[],"The companies that produce goods at the heart of the US consumer economy – SUVs, washing machines, heavy equipment, and hamburgers – kept rolling along at the end of 2022. But corporate executives on conference calls were guarded in their comments on Tuesday, January 31, noting solid demand while simultaneously pointing to the need to hold costs down in the face of higher inflation and expectations for economic growth to moderate – but not collapse. “We’re not doing anything in anticipation of a recession,” said General Motors chief financial officer Paul Jacobson told analysts on a call, after the company posted better-than-expected results and forecast a more upbeat 2023 than analysts expected. “Consumer demand is still holding up.” Bellwethers including McDonald’s, Exxon Mobil, appliance maker Whirlpool, and delivery giant United Parcel Service posted results that exceeded estimates. Right now, S&P 500 companies have reported a 4.5% year-over-year rise in revenue. That exceeds what was expected on January 1, but is short of the previous year’s double-digit growth rates, and it is expected to slow in the first half of 2023, according to Refinitiv, motivating the cautious outlook. “We want to be cautious. That’s why we are talking about a $2-billion cost-cutting program,” said GM’s Jacobson, who said those cuts are planned over two years. GM is not alone. Exxon also said it would cut spending even after reporting a record $56-billion profit in 2022, and UPS exceeded estimates due in part to reducing expenses. However, the hundreds of thousands of technology job layoffs announced by Microsoft, Intel, and others are not being mirrored in the rest of the economy. That is a good sign for the broader economy, according to Lori Calvasina, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “We are optimistic this condition can remain in place given the strong levels of demand and backlogs that we continue to hear about from publicly traded industrial companies,” she wrote on Monday, January 30. Calvasina said the market’s recent performance may reflect expectations for a mild downturn followed by a solid recovery in 2024. The S&P 500 is up 4.6% in January, the best first month for the index since 2019. US economic growth came in at a better-than-expected 2.9% rate for the fourth quarter. It is early, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank’s first-quarter gross domestic product estimate is currently 0.7%. The economy’s performance may depend on whether price pressures that have afflicted consumer and business spending start to wane. There is some evidence of that, as the core personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 5% year-over-year rate in December, the lowest since September 2021. Still, that rate is pressuring margins, numerous executives said on Tuesday. Whirlpool chief executive officer Marc Bitzer said that “inflationary pressures remained stubbornly high” during the fourth quarter, and Caterpillar executives suggested pricing pressures will continue, after saying on the previous earnings call they expected them to moderate. Caterpillar’s fourth-quarter earnings dropped by 29%. Even so, the feeling around the economy itself remains relatively positive. “As we go into 2023, there is going to continue to be inflation,” said Christopher Kempczinski, McDonald’s CEO, on the company’s earnings call on Tuesday. “Do you reach a point where maybe it does start to materialize around the consumer? Certainly, consumer sentiment out there remains depressed in many markets. But we’re not seeing it right now.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-eurozone-q4-2022/,[],"FRANKFURT, Germany – The eurozone eked out growth in the final three months of 2022, managing to avoid a recession even as sky-high energy costs, waning confidence, and rising interest rates took a toll on the economy that is likely to persist into this year. Gross domestic product (GDP) across the currency bloc expanded by a tiny 0.1% in the fourth quarter, data from Eurostat showed on Tuesday, January 31, outperforming expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1% drop. Compared to a year earlier, growth was 1.9%, just beating expectations of 1.8%. Among the biggest eurozone countries, Germany and Italy recorded negative growth rates for the quarter but France and Spain expanded, Eurostat added, based on a flash estimate that is subject to revisions. Russia’s nearly year-old war in Ukraine has proved costly for the eurozone, which now spans 350 million people in 20 countries, given some members’ heavy reliance on cheap energy. Surging oil and gas prices have depleted savings and held back investment, while forcing the European Central Bank (ECB) into unprecedented rate hikes to arrest inflation. But the economy has displayed some unexpected resilience, too – much like during the COVID-19 pandemic, when growth outperformed expectations as businesses adjusted faster to changed circumstances than policymakers had predicted. More recent figures like a crucial confidence indicator or the latest purchasing managers’ index data suggest growth may have hit bottom already and a slow recovery is underway, helped by generous government support and a mild winter that has limited energy spending. The overall picture nevertheless remains weak, with meager growth forecast for 2023 due to a large drop in real incomes and surging interest rates. “The headline GDP figure gives a misleadingly favorable impression of economic conditions in late 2022,” said Ken Wattret, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “The key takeaway from member states’ data is the breadth of weakness in private consumption, with the acute squeeze on household real incomes due to soaring inflation belatedly biting.” Ireland’s 3.5% Q4 growth figure distorted the overall picture as it was driven largely by activity among big foreign companies based there for tax reasons, economists said, adding that without Ireland, eurozone growth would have been zero. The ECB has raised rates by a combined 2.5 percentage points to 2% since July to tame inflation, and markets see another 1.5 percentage points of increases by midyear, which would put the deposit rate at its highest level since the turn of the century. Such a rapid increase is putting a brake on bank lending, a key source of credit for businesses, and access to loans has already suffered the biggest drop last quarter since the bloc’s 2011 debt crisis. “In the coming months, the noticeable tightening of monetary policy will increasingly slow down the economy,” Commerzbank economist Christoph Weil said. “We continue to expect the euro area economy to contract slightly in the first half of the year, and the recovery expected in the second half is likely to be weak.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/inter-american-commission-human-rights-calls-stronger-reproductive-protections/,[],"MEXICO CITY, Mexico – The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) on Wednesday, February 1, called for countries in the Americas to reinforce protections for women and girls seeking abortions, after observing measures that “go backwards” last year. “Both material and formal measures were observed that go backwards in the guarantee of reproductive rights free of all forms of violence and discrimination,” the IACHR said in a statement. El Salvador “stood out,” it said, for 30 and 50-year sentences for homicide imposed on two women last year, despite rights activists saying they suffered miscarriages. The small Central American country, which has some of the world’s harshest anti-abortion laws, bans all terminations even if the pregnancy poses a risk to the woman’s life or results from rape or incest. Even in countries where abortion is partially legal, the IACHR said girls and teens who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest faced difficulties accessing healthcare. In Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Panama, medical and legal professionals helping provide access to abortions permitted under national laws faced threats of legal action, according to the IACHR. While many U.S. states protect access to abortion, the body highlighted the overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for close to half a century established a constitutional right to abortion. The IACHR praised Colombia’s decriminalization of abortion through 24 weeks of gestation last February, as well as moves by Mexican states, including southern Quintana Roo, to allow abortion within a set number of weeks. Quintana Roo state borders Guatemala, which has hardened punishments for women who abort to up to 25 years in jail. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-coup-takes-catastrophic-toll/,[],"Two years after Myanmar’s military coup, a young factory worker turned resistance fighter mourns the loss of his leg in battle. A former diplomat has not seen his family in four years. A beauty queen adjusts to a new life in wintry Canada. And an exiled teacher dreams of returning to school. The February 1, 2021 coup, which unseated Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, has left a trail of upended lives in its wake. US-based conflict monitoring group Acled says about 19,000 people died last year as a crackdown on protests led many to take up arms against the military. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced and over 70,000 have left the country, according to the United Nations, which has accused the military of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Myanmar’s military says it is carrying out a legitimate campaign against “terrorists”. It did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters. The stories of four people reflect a crisis the UN special envoy last week warned was taking a “catastrophic toll” on the population. Aye Chan heard the rat-tat-tat of gunfire followed by an explosion. “I didn’t know if I had been hit or not,” the 21-year-old told Reuters, recalling the military attack last year that cost him his leg. When he tried to stand, his legs didn’t work. A comrade carried him to a hospital where he awoke to find one had been amputated from the knee down. A factory worker making instant noodles before the coup, he had been part of the massive crowds which took to the streets to demand democracy be restored after the coup. When protest groups began taking up arms, he joined them. The first time on the frontlines, his heart was pounding. “Then I looked around at my comrades and they were smiling and laughing. I was not afraid.” While morale among the resistance troops is high, he said, they are outmatched by a well-equipped army. “When they shoot, they shoot continuously, we can’t even raise our head,” he said. “We need to save bullets as well.” Now, he spends most days sleeping, cooking and sharing food with friends. “I try to live my life as happily as I can,” he said. “I can’t do the things I did before.” Reuters is not disclosing his whereabouts for security reasons. He has no regrets about joining the resistance. “If I recover enough, I will go back to war. This is until the end.” Aung Soe Moe, 52, was the first secretary in Myanmar’s embassy in Japan when the coup happened. A month later, he joined hundreds of thousands of government workers who quit to join the civil disobedience movement, which aimed to cripple the military’s ability to govern. His wife, stuck in Myanmar with his daughter after the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraged him to speak out. They later fled across the border to Thailand, where many from Myanmar have sought refuge but have been trapped without documents. He has not seen them since 2019. Alone in Tokyo, he had to move out of his plush three-bed apartment in the embassy grounds. With his source of income gone, other Myanmar residents in Japan offered money to cover his basics and rent for a cramped studio flat. Japan’s government extended Aung Soe Moe’s diplomatic visa so he could remain in Tokyo, but he can’t work and that visa expires in July. Japan’s foreign ministry declined to comment on his future status. “I suffered a lot but there is nothing worse than losing the future of the people in Myanmar,” he told Reuters. He volunteers a few days a week doing administrative tasks such as writing social media posts for Myanmar’s National Unity Government – a parallel civilian government set up after the coup. He is worried the world will forget about Myanmar, especially since the war in Ukraine. “But the Myanmar people have not given up on the truth,” he said. “We will never give up!” When the military seized power, 23-year-old Han Lay was a model about to take part in an international beauty contest in Thailand. After protesting with friends, she decided to use her platform to speak about Myanmar. The night before, she couldn’t sleep with excitement and worry, she said. On the stage, she fought back tears as she spoke about military violence on a day when more than 140 demonstrators were killed. The clip went viral. In Myanmar, the military charged her with sedition. She was detained at an airport in Bangkok for several days, pleading on social media not to be sent back to Myanmar. Eventually she flew to Canada and settled in London, Ontario, where she lives with a Burmese-Canadian family, refugees from the 1988 democracy uprising also crushed by the military. She said she had been lonely when she first arrived but was adjusting. “I was born in Myanmar, and my family, my friends, and my future, everything (is) in Myanmar… I could not have a chance to meet them, I miss them every day,” she said. A middle-school teacher has been living in a Thai border town since fleeing arrest in Myanmar last year. A slight woman with long black hair, she joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM) that sprang up after the coup. She asked not to be named, for fear of military reprisals. “I knew that my life would become difficult if I joined CDM,” she said. “But if we don’t revolt, it will not be OK for our future.” She joined street protests wearing her green and white teacher uniform, and fled the country after the crackdown. Like many Myanmar refugees in Thailand, she is undocumented and lives in fear of arrest. She ekes out a living crocheting bags and clothing, earning less than $10 a week, and relies on food donations from the parallel civilian government. “I will be a CDM-er til the end,” she said. “A person needs to go through both good times and bad times. Her green and white uniform is safe in Myanmar, she said, neatly stored, in case of her return. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/superman-batman-swamp-thing-anchor-dc-studios-revamped-movie-television-slate/,[],"LOS ANGELES, USA – Stories about Batman and his assassin son, a new Superman tale and Swamp Thing are set to hit the big screen as part of an ambitious 10-year plan to reinvigorate DC Studios under new owner Warner Bros Discovery. Despite a rich stable of characters from Batman to Wonder Woman, the DC film and television studio has failed to match the success of Walt Disney Co’s Marvel hit factory. “The history of DC is pretty messed up,” said director James Gunn, who directed three Guardians of the Galaxy movies for Marvel and was tapped last year to revamp DC Studios. “We’re going to promise that everything from our first project forward is going to be unified.” Gunn and DC Studios co-chairman Peter Safran on Monday, January 30, unveiled a Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired plan to tell a single story that unfolds over eight to 10 years, through 10 upcoming film and TV projects. The first phase, “Gods and Monsters,” uses some of the DC Universe’s best-known super heroes to introduce audiences to a new generation of characters. Gunn said he worked with a team of five writers to sketch out one connected story. At the same time, the studio will release stories that fall outside this central DC Universe narrative, dubbed DC Elseworlds, as with the comic books. One example is Joker: Folie a Deux, the sequel to the 2019 Oscar-nominated drama. Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav is hoping to reap the financial rewards of a reinvigorated DC franchise. The media company’s shares have fallen 43% in the past year as the company aims to deliver $3 billion in savings from combining Warner Media and Discovery Communications. “The stakes are enormous,” said Safran, who has produced two Aquaman films and two Shazam movies. “It’s a brand that was in somewhat chaos, and it’s an opportunity to build an extraordinary stand-alone studio.” DC Studios will offer a spin on the familiar Superman story with Superman: Legacy, a story written by Gunn that examines how the character reconciles his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing. It is slated for release on July 11, 2025. Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates also is working on a script for Superman in which a Black actor portrays the Man of Steel, as a DC Elseworlds project. Also in 2025, DC Studios will release Batman – Part II, a sequel starring Robert Pattison, a darker, more adult tale that is not part of Gunn’s newly envisioned “DC Universe.” Another Batman movie, The Brave and the Bold, will introduce the hero’s assassin son as his crime-fighting sidekick, Robin. Lanterns, an eight-hour detective series, is scheduled to stream on HBO Max. Other TV projects include Waller, with Viola Davis reprising her Suicide Squad role as Amanda Waller, and Paradise Lost, the origin story of Themyscira, the island where Wonder Woman was born. A television series, Creature Commandos, in which Waller forms a black ops team out of monstrous prisoners, is in production. While Marvel has become the highest-grossing film franchise in history, DC Studios has had mixed results. A dark Joker film became an Oscar nominee and billion-dollar hit, but Black Adam and Justice League struggled to generate superhero-sized returns. Four DC film projects that were completed before Gunn and Safran took over the studio will be released to theaters this year, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Zaslav cut some costs by scrapping a third Wonder Woman film and a Batgirl movie that was headed to streaming. The movie division also has cut jobs in marketing and distribution. – Rappler.com"

Riseborough was nominated for best actress for playing an alcoholic single mother in the little-seen film, a shock to awards pundits who had not expected her to be in the mix. The surprise nomination sparked questions about whether a campaign for Riseborough had violated lobbying rules set by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Several A-list stars posted social media comments touting her performance. On Tuesday, Academy CEO Bill Kramer said the organization “has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film’s nomination should be rescinded.” “However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly,” Kramer added. The academy limits how studios can reach out to voters, how often and what they can say in any communications as part of their Oscars campaigns. Winners of the Academy Awards will be announced on March 12. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/alec-baldwin-charged-recklessness-rust-shooting/,[],"Actor Alec Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter on Tuesday, January 31, for showing a “reckless” disregard for safety that led to the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Western movie Rust in New Mexico in 2021, according to court documents. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies filed charges following months of speculation as to whether she had evidence that Baldwin showed criminal negligence when a revolver with which he was rehearsing fired a live round that killed Hutchins. Baldwin and set armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed were each charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. The most serious charge – which carries a potential sentence of five years in jail – would require prosecutors to convince a jury Baldwin was not just negligent but reckless in his use of a firearm. A lawyer for Baldwin declined to comment. Hutchins lawyer said the prosecutor had “completely misunderstood the facts and has reached the wrong conclusions.” Baldwin’s case is remarkable in that there is little or no precedent for an actor to face criminal charges for an on-set death since the birth of Hollywood. A probable cause statement accompanying the charges names Baldwin as both an actor and producer on the movie and says: “On the day of the shooting alone, evidence shows that no less than a dozen acts, or omissions of recklessness, occurred in the short time prior to lunch and the time of the shooting, and this does not include the reckless handling of the firearm by Baldwin.” The 30 Rock actor has denied responsibility for the shooting, saying Hutchins directed him to point the gun at the camera, he cocked the revolver but never pulled the trigger. He said it was the job of Gutierrez-Reed and other weapons professionals to ensure it was unloaded, a position supported by many actors and the SAG-AFTRA union. Prosecutors said photos and videos from inside the movie-set church prior to the shooting show Baldwin with his finger inside of the trigger guard and on the trigger while manipulating the hammer, drawing, pointing and holstering the revolver. Industry-wide firearms safety guidelines published by SAG-AFTRA tell actors to “never place your finger on the trigger until you’re ready to shoot.” An FBI forensic test of the revolver found it “functioned normally” and would not fire without the trigger being pulled. Prosecutors could face long odds convincing a jury Baldwin is criminally liable because he was assured the gun was safe to handle before it fired a live round, according to legal experts. Baldwin failed to attend firearms training sessions and on the day of the shooting did not demand at least two safety checks of the firearm between the armorer and himself, something he said was standard protocol in interviews with media and police, prosecutors said. Gutierrez-Reed has said she checked the rounds she loaded into the gun were dummies before handing it to first assistant director Dave Halls. Halls handed it to Baldwin, telling him it was a “cold gun,” meaning it did not contain an explosive charge, according to police. Halls has signed a plea deal for a misdemeanor charge and is expected to cooperate with the prosecution. For celebrity reputation manager Eric Schiffer, Baldwin’s repeated claims of innocence smacked of celebrity elitism and may have pushed Carmack-Altwies to charge him. “Baldwin believes he’s innocent, and that guns do go off magically, and despite physics and the FBI saying different, and that has led to pressure on prosecutors from the public,” said Schiffer. Gutierrez-Reed has repeatedly said inadequate firearms training on the low-budget movie set contributed to the shooting, a position echoed in the charging documents. On December 7, she testified to New Mexico’s worker safety agency (OSHA) that Baldwin’s lack of knowledge and “poor form” in using a revolver may have led to the discharge that killed Hutchins. She said Baldwin’s training was rushed, skipped safety protocols and consisted largely of firing blanks. The armorer said Baldwin was distracted by texts and FaceTime calls with family and that she was unsure he was “retaining” instruction. “Hannah pleaded to provide more firearms training. She was denied and brushed aside,” said her lawyer Jason Bowles, vowing to fight the charges. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/supreme-court-decision-sec-rule-accreditation-cpa/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) voided the directives of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which required the accreditation of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) who act as external auditors of companies that issue registered securities and possess secondary licenses. The High Court en banc unanimously denied the SEC’s petition seeking to reverse the ruling of the Davao City Regional Trial Court on March 20, 2018. The lower court’s decision had declared paragraph 3, Rule 68 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and SEC Memorandum Circular No. 13-2009 void. According to the SC, the provisions are against Republic Act No. 9298 or the Philippine Accountancy Act of 2004. It added that the enforcement of the memorandum is ultra vires or beyond the commission’s supposed powers. The petition stemmed from the case – filed by Christian Jay Lim, president of the 1Accountants Party List, Inc., as well as other CPAs – for declaratory relief with prayer for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order against the SEC circulars. According to them, the rules were issued without the authority of the SEC and violate the accountancy law. They also argued that these regulations violate CPAs’ rights to due process and equal protection of the law. In its ruling, the SC said the regulations were based on the Securities Regulation Code and the Corporation Code, which do not apply to CPAs. “Thus, all other powers granted by the SRC provisions relied upon by petitioner flow from the SEC’s jurisdiction over corporations, and cannot be made to apply to individual CPAs,” the High Court said. “While petitioner may regulate corporations as well as the securities market, such regulation does not extend to an authority to restrict, even in the slightest degree, the practice of accountancy.” The SC added that the SEC rules pose additional burden on CPAs. “Thus, the CPAs are left with no choice but to go through the accreditation process should they wish to conduct a statutory audit of corporate financial statements, when in fact, such is part of the practice of accountancy for which their CPA license already suffices,” the SC said. It added that the power to supervise CPAs belongs to the Professional Regulatory Board of Accountancy. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-february-1-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Russian forces are making incremental gains in their push to take territory in Ukraine’s eastern province of Donetsk, focusing on the town of Bakhmut north of the regional capital. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government is lobbying hard for some of its neighbors and Western allies to supply fighter jets that it can use to repulse Russian advances. It took months of Ukraine’s appeals before Western countries last week pledged modern battle tanks, and Kyiv wants jets sooner rather than later. In Paris after meeting Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said “there was no taboo” about supplying Kyiv with fighter planes. The United States and Britain have thus far rejected the idea but repeated their willingness to continue military support to Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in February 2022 in what Moscow called a “special military operation” to protect Russian security and Russian speakers. The invasion has killed thousands of civilians, uprooted millions and reduced cities to rubble. More recently Russia has characterized the conflict as confronting what it says is an aggressive and expansionist US-led NATO military alliance. The West has so far refused to send weapons that could be used to attack deep inside Russia for fear of starting a wider war although Moscow has denounced recent Western pledges of weapons as provocations. The United States, which has provided Ukraine about $27.2 billion in military aid since Russia’s invasion, is preparing a $2.2 billion package of additional assistance. That is expected to offer Kyiv longer-range rockets for the first time and other munitions and weapons, two U.S. officials briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Bakhmut came under renewed fire as did Klishchiivka and Kurdyumivka, villages on the southern approaches to Bakhmut, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Tuesday night, January 31. Weeks of relentless pounding of Bakhmut have been similar to the drive by Russian forces to capture two cities further north – Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk – in June and July. Russian forces on Tuesday made no headway in attempts to advance on Avdiivka, the second focal point of Russian attacks in Donetsk region, Kyiv’s military general staff said. Russian forces also tried to advance near Lyman, a town further north in Donetsk region that was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in October, the military said. Russia was reaching further west in Donetsk by firing on the town of Vuhledar and a half dozen other towns and villages, the Ukraine military said. Vuhledar is about 148 km (90 miles) away from the main fighting in and around Bakhmut. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said the Russian force in the new Vuhledar assault was at least the size of a brigade, a unit typically comprising several thousand troops. The Ukrainian military statement did not mention the village of Blahodatne, which Russia says it has captured, and sits on one of the main roads into Bakhmut about 5 km (3 miles) north. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the situation there or other battlefield reports. Zelenskiy said he had several meetings with top defence officials on Tuesday. “We are examining in detail all the key sectors and what the prospects for them are,” he said in an evening video address, without providing details. “What the occupier is preparing and how we are already responding to Russia’s preparations to wreak revenge,” a reference to the setbacks Ukrainian troops inflicted on Russian forces last year in repelling advances around the country and retaking territory that had been occupied by Russia. In Washington, the United States said Russia was violating the New START nuclear arms control treaty between the two countries. US President Joe Biden’s administration has been eager to preserve the treaty but ties with Moscow are the worst in decades over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control,” a State Department spokesperson said. Also in Washington, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a staunch supporter of providing military aid to Ukraine, met with Republican lawmakers. The Republicans took over the House of Representatives from the Democrats at the start of this year and some hardline members among them have called for an end to U.S. military and other assistance to Ukraine, which amounts to tens of billions of dollars. “My mission is to demonstrate that Ukraine will win – and that there is no conceivable case for delay in further supporting the Ukrainians to win this year,” Johnson said in a statement. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will discuss Russia’s war in Ukraine with Chinese officials during a February 5-6 trip to China, the White House said on Tuesday. A week after seeming to open the door for Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Olympics, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it is standing by sanctions imposed against the countries over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. – Rappler.com"

Austin, who flew in from the Republic of Korea, marking his second visit to the Philippines since 2021, and his first under the new Marcos administration. Upon welcoming Austin to the Southeast Asian country on Tuesday night, US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said the senior official’s visit demonstrated Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to its longtime ally. Austin’s visit comes just nearly two months after US Vice President Kamala Harris completed an official trip to the Philippines last November 2022, and is also the latest in “unprecedented” series of high-level visits by US officials to the country since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in end-June last year. While in town, Austin is expected to hold a meeting with Marcos, as well as his counterpart Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. The US defense chief will also meet with Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo and Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff General Andres Centino. A readout from the US Department of Defense (DOD) indicated Austin would tackle “speeding up” the implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a military deal that allows the US military to preposition defense assets and construct facilities in select Philippine bases. High on the agenda were expectations that the treaty partners would announce five new locations to be included under the deal. “We anticipate that 2023 is going to be a very exciting year for the alliance…. Right now, I think we’re seeing a very positive upswing in the trajectory of the relationship,” a senior defense official traveling with Austin told the US DOD. Austin’s visit also seeks to tackle ways to “modernize” the two countries’ 76-year-old alliance to address new and emerging threats, including China’s continued assertion of its expansive claims in the South China Sea. The Philippines and the US share a Mutual Defense Treaty, which sees both sides commit to defend one another in case of an attack, including in the West Philippine Sea. “We’ll be actively talking about what we can do together to address what has been a pretty notable period of harassment and coercion recently in the South China Sea,” the senior official said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-arrives-congo-conflict-rages-country-east/,[],"KINSHASA, DR Congo – Huge crowds cheered for Pope Francis as he travelled into the Democratic Republic of Congo capital Kinshasa in his popemobile on Tuesday, January 31, beginning a visit that will highlight the human cost of decades of conflict in the vast central African country. Francis is the first pope to visit Congo since John Paul II in 1985, when it was still known as Zaire. About half of Congo’s population of 90 million are Roman Catholics. Tens of thousands of people lined the route from Kinshasa airport into town, with some breaking away to chase the pope’s convoy while others chanted and waved Congolese and Vatican flags in one of the most vibrant welcomes of his foreign trips. At the airport earlier, the 86-year-old pope, who struggles to walk due to a chronic knee ailment, was lowered from his plane, then pushed in a wheelchair onto a red carpet leading to the terminal. Congolese Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde greeted him, then accompanied him inside. “For me, it’s the first time I’m seeing him other than on television. It’s a moment of joy,” said Alain Difima, a Catholic priest who spent hours waiting for the pope to land. The pope was heading for the presidential palace for a formal welcome ceremony, then a meeting with President Felix Tshisekedi. Afterwards, the pontiff will give a speech to authorities, diplomats and representatives of civil society. On Wednesday, he will celebrate Mass and meet victims of violence from the eastern part of the country, which is blighted by recurring fighting between rebels from the M23 group and government troops. “I wanted to go to Goma but we can’t because of the war,” the pope told reporters during his flight, referring to a city in eastern Congo. Congo has some of the world’s richest deposits of diamonds, gold, copper, cobalt, tin, tantalum and lithium, but its abundant mineral resources have stoked conflict between militias, government troops and foreign invaders. Mining has also been linked to inhumane exploitation of workers and environmental degradation. Eastern Congo has also been plagued by violence connected to the long and complex fallout from the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda. An estimated 5.7 million people are internally displaced in Congo and 26 million face severe hunger, largely because of the impact of armed conflict, according to the United Nations. The Catholic Church plays a crucial role in running schools and health facilities in the country, as well as promoting democracy. First scheduled for last July, the pope’s trip was postponed because he was suffering a flare-up of a chronic knee ailment. Francis will stay in Kinshasa until Friday morning, when he will fly to South Sudan, another country grappling with conflict and poverty. In a first, he will be accompanied for that leg of his journey by the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the global Anglican Communion, and by the Church of Scotland Moderator. The religious leaders have described their joint visit as a “pilgrimage of peace”. – Rappler.com"

Here are some of the points raised by the report, and the Adani Group’s responses. Gautam Adani, from Gujarat in western India, built his empire from scratch after starting out as a commodities trader. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from the same state and their relationship has long come under scrutiny by Modi’s opponents. From being a school dropout, Adani rose to become Asia’s richest man. His $220-billion empire spans ports, power generation, airports, mining, edible oils, renewable power, media, and cement. Founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson, Hindenburg Research is a forensic financial research firm which analyzes equity, credit, and derivatives. It has a track record of finding corporate wrongdoings and placing bets against the companies. Hindenburg disclosed that it holds short positions in Adani companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. It released a report alongside that accused the conglomerate of improper use of tax havens and flagged concerns about its debt levels. The Adani Group has called the report baseless and termed the allegations “unsubstantiated speculations.” No. India’s capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, has investigated some of these issues over the past year following local media reports. Reuters reported the regulator will continue this scrutiny and draw on any fresh information in the Hindenburg report. The short-seller has said that listed Adani companies have seen a number of changes in chief financial officers and that auditors used by the group are relatively unknown. It said Adani Enterprises has had five CFOs over the course of eight years, citing this as “a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.” The Adani Group said that several of the CFOs that the Hindenburg report points to have remained within the group and moved on to new roles. On the quality of audits, it said that the audit committee of each of the listed companies is composed entirely of independent directors, and auditors are appointed on their recommendation. On Tuesday, January 31, Mint newspaper reported that the group is considering an independent audit of group companies to provide comfort to investors. Reuters could not independently verify this. The report says key listed Adani companies have substantial debt and are over-leveraged. It also says the group faces liquidity risks due to high short-term liabilities, with five of the seven key listed companies having reported “current ratios” below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure. Adani responded by saying leverage ratios of its companies continue to be healthy and are in line with the industry benchmarks of the respective sectors, further adding that this information is publicly disclosed regularly. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/india-adani-group-share-sale-january-2023/,[],"MUMBAI, India – Gautam Adani’s crucial $2.5-billion share sale was fully subscribed on Tuesday, January 31, as investors pumped funds into his flagship firm, despite a $65-billion rout in the Indian billionaire’s stocks sparked by a short-seller’s report. The fundraising is critical for Adani, not just because it will help cut his group’s debt, but also because it is being seen by some as a gauge of confidence at a time when the tycoon faces one of his biggest business and reputational challenges. Hindenburg Research’s report last week alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and concerns about high debt, which Adani denied, but the subsequent market meltdown has led to a dramatic and sudden fall in his fortunes as he slipped to eighth from third in Forbes rich list rankings. India’s largest ever secondary share sale attracted participation from anchor investors including Maybank Securities and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as India’s HDFC Life Insurance and state-backed Life Insurance Corporation. But while the 30% anchor portion of the issue had been subscribed fully last week, the book building had only 3% in bids on Monday, January 30, amid concerns over the rout in Adani’s stocks. By Tuesday, the overall share sale was fully subscribed as foreign institutional investors and corporate funds flooded in, although participation by retail investors and Adani Enterprises employees remained low. “Investors would view the successful completion of the FPO (follow-on public offering) as a welcome relief, as it implies that the company still has the support of institutional investors,” Leonard Law, senior credit analyst at Lucror Analytics Singapore, said on Tuesday. “The FPO would help to enlarge Adani Enterprises’ public float (thereby partly addressing the issue over the promoters’ concentrated shareholding), as well as reduce leverage for the company and improve investor sentiment,” Law added. The offer closes days after Adani’s public face-off with Hindenburg Research, which last week flagged concerns about the use of tax havens and “substantial debt” at the group. It added that shares in seven Adani listed companies have an 85% downside due to what it called “sky-high valuations.” That Adani group has said it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements, calling the report baseless and adding it is considering taking action against Hindenburg. Support for Adani’s share sale came even as the flagship’s shares closed at 2,973.9 rupees, up nearly 3% but below the lower end of the sale price band of 3,112 rupees. Adani Group’s total gross debt in the financial year ended March 31, 2022, rose 40% to 2.2 trillion rupees ($26.83 billion). Adani said on Sunday, January 29, in response to Hindenburg’s allegations that over the past decade the group has “consistently de-levered.” Adani said the Hindenburg report was a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions, while its chief financial officer compared the market rout of its stocks to a colonial-era massacre. Hindenburg later said Adani’s “response largely confirmed our findings and ignored our key questions.” Asked about the Adani-Hindenburg saga, India’s chief economic adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran told reporters the “corporate sector as a whole has deleveraged and their balance sheets are healthy. So, what happens to one particular corporate group, is a matter between the market and the corporate group.” Adani had in recent days repeatedly said investors were standing by its side and the share offering would go through. Bankers at one point had considered tweaking the pricing of the issue, or extending the sale, Reuters had reported. Most of the demand during the public book building process came from non-institutional investors who invested more than 1 million rupees each, with bids totaling five times the shares on offer. The portion for qualified institutional buyers, which includes foreign investors, was 1.2 times subscribed. But domestic financial institutions or banks, as well as domestic mutual funds, made no bids. And demand from retail investors and company employees remained muted, garnering bids of 12% and 55% of shares on offer. “The Hindenburg report has taken a toll on the sentiment especially at the retail level. The purpose of the FPO was twofold – to raise funds to reduce the debt and to broadbase the shareholding…they haven’t been able to broadbase the shareholding,” Ambareesh Baliga, a Mumbai-based independent market analyst, said. Adani’s firm held extensive discussions over the weekend and through Monday with investment bankers and institutional investors to attract subscriptions, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the talks. The names of investors is not yet available, but Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Company said late on Monday that it will invest $400 million. Adani Transmission closed nearly 4% higher on Tuesday after losing 38% since the Hindenburg report, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone climbed 2.6%. Adani Total Gas closed down 10% at its lower price limit, while Adani Power and Adani Wilmar were down 5% each. Hindenburg said in its report it had shorted US-bonds and non-India traded derivatives of the Adani Group. On Tuesday, US dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone continued their fall into a second week. – Rappler.com"

Blinken is urging calm on both sides after last week’s killing by a Palestinian gunman of seven people outside a synagogue in the worst such attack in the Jerusalem area for years. He was set to repeat the message at a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. Last week, Abbas’ Palestinian Authority suspended its security cooperation agreement with Israel after the largest raid in years, when Israeli forces penetrated deep into a refugee camp in the northern city of Jenin, setting off a gunfight in which 10 Palestinians died. PA leaders are angry after months of raids by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. In January alone, 35 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops, in the bloodiest month since 2015, while officials say attacks on Palestinian property by Israeli settlers have also increased. Blinken is also expected to highlight US assistance to the Palestinian economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign aid. Before meeting Abbas, Blinken visited Deir Dibwan, a town near Ramallah that is home to many Palestinian Americans, and met civil society leaders and businesspeople. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, back in power at the head of one of the most right-wing governments in Israel’s history, has reinforced troops in the West Bank and promised measures to strengthen settlements there, but so far held off from more extreme steps. On Tuesday, Blinken met Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and discussed cooperation to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon as well the situation in the West Bank. Hopes of achieving a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state based largely in the West Bank alongside Israel, have all but disappeared since the last round of US-sponsored talks stalled in 2014.

https://www.rappler.com/business/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-earnings-report-january-december-2022/,[],"OSLO, Norway – Norway’s wealth fund, one of the world’s largest investors, posted a record loss of 1.64 trillion crowns ($164.4 billion) for 2022, bringing to an end a three-year run of soaring profits as stocks and bonds were hit by the Ukraine war and inflation. The previous largest loss was 633 billion crowns in 2008. It ends a record-breaking streak for the fund, where annual returns exceeded 1 trillion crowns in each of the three years from 2019 to 2021, amounting to more than 4 trillion crowns combined. “We are invested in 9,000 companies in 70 countries. There is just nowhere to hide,” fund chief executive Nicolai Tangen told a news conference. The single biggest stock market loss came from the fund’s stake in Amazon, which declined in value by 56 billion crowns, followed by a loss in shares of Facebook owner Meta Platforms of 52 billion and in Tesla with 47 billion. Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows. The inflows in 2022 were nearly three times the previous record, of 386 billion crowns, set in 2008. The fund invests the Norwegian state’s revenues from petroleum production. As a major crude exporter and Europe’s largest gas supplier after a drop in Russian gas flows, Norway benefited from high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine. “We have to be very conscious of the fact that the inflow came against a tragic backdrop in Europe,” Tangen said. “But it is an isolated mathematical fact that when oil and gas prices are higher, there is more revenue to the [Norwegian] government and more inflow into the fund.” The fund owns on average 1.3% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds, unlisted real estate, and renewable energy projects. Looking ahead, Tangen said inflation would continue to be a worry. “Inflation remains a risk factor and, in particular, tied into what will happen when China really kicks in on the consumption side because it could drive a lot of prices globally,” Tangen told Reuters. “And then of course we have still geopolitical hotspots.” The fund’s return on investment in 2022 stood at minus 14.1% for the year, which was 0.88 percentage point better than the return on the fund’s benchmark index. – Rappler.com $1 = 9.9752 Norwegian crowns"
https://www.rappler.com/business/court-appeals-meralco-san-miguel-power-supply-deal-still-suspended-january-2023/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines – The suspension of the power supply deal between the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) and South Premiere Power Corporation (SPPC) remains in place. SPPC is a subsidiary of SMC Global Power Holdings Corporation under Ramon Ang’s San Miguel. The 13th Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) granted the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction filed by SPPC, which means the company’s deal to supply 670 megawatts to Meralco from its Ilijan gas-fired power plant is still suspended. In a resolution on Wednesday, January 25, Associate Justice Mary Charlene Hernandez-Azura emphasized that the decision does not terminate the power supply agreement. Rather, it was made to allow the parties to negotiate the terms of the PSA. SPPC earlier sought to end its deal with Meralco after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) denied its proposal to hike power rates. The company argued that an increase was needed as it was suffering financial losses due to skyrocketing coal and fuel prices. SPPC and Meralco jointly wanted the rate hike, saying that it would be the better alternative instead of sourcing power from the Wholesale Spot Electricity Market, which has higher and more volatile prices. But the ERC was firm in saying that prices are fixed in the PSA to protect consumers from volatility. The commission went on to explain that while there are exceptions in the contract that would have allowed an increase, the circumstances in this particular case do not justify a hike. The ERC’s stand, however, was effectively thumbed down by the CA. “The continued implementation of the PSA where petitioner is compelled to bear the cost of energy supplied to the public on its own without any expectation of a reasonable return on its investment not only deprives the petitioner of its property, without due process of law, but also takes its private property for public use without just compensation,” the CA’s decision read. SPPC was ordered to post a bond of P100 million “to answer for any and all damages” the respondents in the case may sustain relative to the court’s ruling. The CA also specified that if the companies fail to reach an agreement within 60 days from the start of negotiations, SPPC would be entitled to terminate the PSA. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier expressed his disappointment with the CA’s previous temporary restraining order that halted the PSA for 60 days, saying it could lead to higher power rates in Metro Manila. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/landmark-mall-cashiers-response-alleged-theft-senate-hearing-january-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Cashiers of department store and supermarket chain Landmark reported multiple instances of the company’s security personnel intimidating and coercing them to admit that they had stolen money. During a Senate committee hearing, cashiers from Landmark Nuvali testified that management had informed them that their daily sales remittances were short of cash – days after the supposed shortage occurred. “December 21 ako na-short. Nalaman ko po December 23 (My cash remittance was found to be short on December 21. I was only informed on December 23),” said Noelene Ediola, a former cashier at Landmark Nuvali. She was merely given a slip of paper stating that her remittance was short by P11,984.55. Her supervisor then asked her to recall her transactions for that day, which she couldn’t do, given the surge of holiday shoppers. When she asked whether she could clarify the matter with the accounting department, she was told that it would be of no use since the documents were “confidential.” The next day, Ediola was summoned to the security office for investigation. “Doon, pilit ako pinapaamin,” she said during the Senate hearing on Monday, January 30. “Ang sabi niya, sabihin ko raw po kung sinong kasabwat ko, kung kanino ko binigay ‘yung pera, paano ko nailabas ‘yung pera. Kasi kung hindi po, sa kulungan daw po ako mag-Papasko.” (There, I was pressured into admitting it. They asked me to tell them who my accomplice was, to whom I gave the money to, and how I brought the money out. Or else, I’d be spending Christmas in jail.) This was not an isolated case. Senator Raffy Tulfo had first exposed the alleged “scheme against cashiers of Landmark Store” in his privilege speech on November 22, 2022. Sharing the story of Landmark Makati cashier Erika Joy Buendicho, Tulfo said that she was similarly accused of having a shortage in her cash turnover amounting to P4,993.71. Being immediately investigated for alleged theft, Buendicho was then repeatedly pressured by Landmark Makati’s security department head Juanito Tanudtanud to admit to the theft. “The security officer interrogating her was forcing her to admit that she took the amount. Personal information about her family was being used against her to establish that she is poor and therefore in dire need of money. That’s why she took the amount,” Tulfo said in his November privilege speech. “Because of the intimidating behavior of security officer Juanito Tanudtanud, she signed a blank document and effectively waived whatever salary she had, and even paid an additional P500 to cover the supposed short she had,” he added. Tulfo said that at least 36 Landmark cashiers had already approached him with similar stories. The cashiers told him that management can take up to a week before informing them of any shortage, and when the cashiers confront management on the basis of their alleged shortages, they are simply told that documents were confidential. Representatives from Landmark Makati, however, have strongly denied that documents were being kept confidential. “Documented po ‘yan your honor. Nakalagay po diyan lahat ng inendorse niyang pera. Bilang po ‘yan. Binibilang po nila ang pera nila tapos sina-submit po nila sa supervisor. Sila ang nagbibilang ng pera,” said Landmark store counter manager Josefina Miclat. (It’s documented, your honor. All the money that she endorsed is stated there. It’s counted. They themselves count the money, and then they submit it to their supervisor. They’re the ones who count the money.) Miclat insisted that cashiers were present when their remittances were being counted and audited against their cash register’s journal tapes. However, she admitted that the results of the audit were not reported on the same day as the cashier’s shift, which explained why cashiers were informed about their shortages late. “Hindi po mache-check, your honor. Gabi na po. Kinabukasan na po chinecheck,” Miclat said, adding that this had been Landmark’s procedure since 1988. (They can’t check it, your honor. It’s already nighttime. They check it the next day.) Tulfo countered that this practice was wrong since the audit should happen on the same day and in the presence of the cashier to allow them to explain any anomalies. “Even if it takes you until midnight, you should have that accounting right there and then in front of the cashier,” Tulfo said in a mix of English and Filipino. Former Landmark Nuvali cashier Regina Lomerio, who had worked as a cashier in multiple other establishments, also confirmed that the practice was highly unusual. “Sa tagal ko pong nagkahera, sa Landmark lang po akong nakaranas na hindi po within the day nalalaman ‘yung shortage. Ilang days po nila bago binibigay ‘yung shortage namin,” she said. “Tapos, ang masakit po noon, kahit po hindi kami pumipirma doon sa mga papel na iniissue nila, automatic pa din dinededuct sa sahod namin ‘yung nawawalang pera.” (In my long career as a cashier, it’s only in Landmark that I’ve experienced not learning about a shortage within the day. It takes them days before they tell us about our shortage. And what hurts even more, even if we don’t sign the paper that they issue, our salary is still automatically deducted for the missing money.) Meanwhile, when asked whether Tanudtanud had any solid evidence proving that Buendicho had pocketed the alleged shortage, the security chief was silent. Tanudtanud also admitted that closed-circuit television cameras were not yet installed near Buendicho’s cashier station when the incident occurred. “In this case, puro ka suspetsa. Wala ka talagang hard evidence. Wala kang karapatan na pagbintangan at pilitin umamin ‘yung isang tao – na wala ka talagang ebidensya – hanggang sa ma-pressure itong tao. E na napaamin na lang nang hindi oras,” Tulfo said. (In this case, all you had were suspicions. You didn’t have any hard evidence. You have no right to accuse and force a person to admit to something – when you don’t have any evidence – until they’re pressured to do so. That leads them to admit to something before they were supposed to.) Senator Bato dela Rosa, who served as a former Philippine National Police chief, urged Tanudtanud not to coerce suspects when investigating them for any incident. “Respetuhin niyo ang kanilang rights,” he said. “Remember palagi: you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney or counsel of your own choice. Everything you say might be taken against you in the court of law. Dapat ganun palagi ‘yung treatment mo sa suspect. Huwag ‘yung presssurin mo na ‘aminin mo na, aminin mo na.’ Anong klaseng investigation ‘yan?” (Respect their rights. Always remember: you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney or counsel of your own choice. Everything you say might be taken against you in the court of law. That’s how you treat a suspect. Don’t pressure them by saying ‘admit it, admit it.’ What kind of investigation is that?) – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/ofws-died-hands-employers-kuwait/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – News of the tragic killing of overseas Filipino worker (OFW) Jullebee Ranara in Kuwait sent a shockwave across the Philippines, with the governments involved, rights groups, and Ranara’s loved ones calling for justice. Ranara, a 34-year-old domestic worker, was allegedly killed by the 17-year-old son of her employer. Her burnt body was found in a desert on January 21. Authorities flew her remains back to the Philippines on January 27, with the repatriation fees shouldered by her employer. Kuwaiti government officials vowed to Jullebee’s family and Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople that justice would be served. Ople, confident that the Kuwaiti authorities are willing to dialogue for labor reforms, thumbed down the option to implement a deployment ban to the Gulf state. Ranara’s fate is not the first of its kind. While domestic worker abuse is rampant across the Middle East, a popular destination for OFWs, certain deaths of OFWs in Kuwait from before have triggered diplomatic action between the Philippines and Kuwait. Here are some things to know about some OFWs who died in Kuwait before Jullebee Ranara. In February 2018, reports came out of a Filipina’s body found in a freezer in an abandoned apartment in Kuwait. She was 29-year-old Joanna Demafelis, who worked as a domestic helper for Syrian woman Mouna Ali Hassoun and her Lebanese husband Nader Essam Assaf. Her body was kept in the freezer for nearly two years. On February 9, then-president Rodrigo Duterte lashed out at Kuwait over the multiple reports of OFWs dying in the region. “What are you doing to my countrymen?” Duterte asked. “Is there something with your culture? Is there something wrong with your values?” The Philippines’ Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) issued a total ban on the deployment of OFWs to Kuwait on February 12. Demafelis’ remains were flown back to the Philippines four days later. Joanna’s employers were arrested in the Syrian capital Damascus later in February. By April, a Kuwaiti court sentenced the couple to death by hanging over Demafelis’ murder. In May, the Philippines lifted its deployment ban to Kuwait after the two countries signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) for additional protection for OFWs in the country. In September 2019, a Syrian court found Hassoun guilty of murder. In May 2019, 47-year-old domestic worker Constancia Lago Dayag was declared dead on arrival at Al Sabah Hospital in Kuwait. Then-labor secretary Silvestre Bello III said she died “in the hands of her employer.” According to Bello, Dayag’s body had various contusions and hematoma, and a cucumber was inserted in her body. Dayag’s death came just a year after the Philippines and Kuwait signed a memorandum of agreement to better protect Filipino workers. “I am taking the Kuwaiti government to task for the gruesome death of yet another Filipino worker in the hands of her employer in Kuwait,” said Bello. “Aside from apparent violation of the agreement on the protection of OFWs between our government and Kuwait, there appears to have been a breach of the employment contract by the foreign employer,” he added. The Department of Foreign Affairs told media that Dayag’s employer Bader Ibrahim Mohammad Hussain was charged with felony murder. A Kuwait Times report said that Kuwaiti security sources found in an initial examination that Dayag died of natural causes. Dayag’s remains were brought back to her home province of Isabela on May 24. Dayag’s eldest child Lovely Jane said in a Philippine Star report that her mother’s face was unrecognizable, and her body had started to decompose. Lovely Jane said in the report that she did not believe her mother died of natural causes. In December 2019, the Philippine government “strongly condemned” the killing of yet another Filipina domestic worker in Kuwait, Jeanelyn Villavende. The DOLE said Villavende was dead on arrival at the hospital and that nurses there reported she was “black and blue.” According to the DOLE, the OFW’s family last spoke to her in October 2019. When they tried to contact her on December 13, her female employer answered and said Villavende was “busy.” The Department of Justice said that she was sexually abused and physically battered for weeks before she died. The autopsy report from the National Bureau of Investigation said she had “clear indications” of sexual abuse, and that she had “old healed wounds.” In January 2020, the DOLE revealed that Villavende informed her recruitment agency of maltreatment and underpayment as early as September 2019, but her concern was ignored. The DOLE said that the alleged attempt of the Kuwaiti government to cover up Villavende’s true cause of death, and its failure to come into an agreement on the standard employment contract in accordance with the 2018 MOA, prompted the Philippines to impose a deployment ban anew. The ban was lifted a month later. Bello said the governing board of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration approved the complete lifting of the ban after murder charges were filed against Villavende’s employers in December 2019. Bello earlier reported that the employers had already been detained by Kuwaiti authorities. In December 2020, the Kuwait Criminal Court sentenced to death Villavende’s female employer for the OFW’s murder. Meanwhile, according to an ABS-CBN report, the employer’s husband was sentenced to four years of jail for not reporting the crime. What was in the 2018 MOA that Kuwait reportedly kept violating? These are the salient features of the agreement: According to a report from the Kuwait Society for Human Rights on the country’s domestic worker law, it is illegal for employers to assign to their helpers “dangerous work that could affect the worker’s health or humiliate the worker’s dignity.” In 2017, the Philippine embassy in Kuwait logged around 6,000 cases of abuse, sexual harassment, and rape. As of December 2022, of the 268,100 OFWs in Kuwait, around 73% are female domestic workers, numbers from the Department of Migrant Workers show. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/international-monetary-fund-united-kingdom-gdp-forecast-january-2023/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Britain is the only Group of Seven nation to have suffered a cut to its 2023 economic growth outlook in International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts published on Tuesday, January 31, adding to pressure on finance minister Jeremy Hunt to come up with a growth plan. Britain’s flagging economy now looks set to shrink by 0.6% this year, a sharp downgrade from previously expected growth of 0.3% in the IMF’s last forecast in October. All other G7 economies are predicted to grow this year, mostly at a stronger pace than the IMF forecast three months ago. The IMF said Britain would struggle with a combination of factors including higher taxes announced by Hunt late last year as he tried to restore the confidence of investors after September’s “mini-budget” of former prime minister Liz Truss. Britain had also been hit particularly hard by the surge in gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as it relied on gas for much of its power generation, and it faced a shortage of workers too that was holding back the economy, the IMF said. The Bank of England’s sharp increase of interest rates to try to stamp out the risks from a jump in inflation would take its toll as well. “All these factors taken together lead to a fairly sharp retrenchment of activity in 2023,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, told reporters. By contrast, Britain is expected to have registered one of the highest growth rates in 2022 among European countries at 4.1%, Gourinchas said. Petya Koeva-Brooks, deputy director of the IMF’s research department, said Britain had a higher share of share of variable rate mortgages than countries such as the United States. “So again, the transmission of monetary policy is much more immediate and quick,” she said. Britain is the only economy in the G7 not to have recovered its pre-pandemic size with Brexit widely seen as unique drag among its peers. Responding to the IMF report, Hunt said nearly all advanced economies were facing headwinds, and that past forecasts from a range of bodies including the IMF had proven too gloomy about Britain’s prospects. “Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects,” he said. Hunt is due to announce measures that he hopes will speed up growth in a budget statement on March 15. Several senior members of the ruling Conservative Party want him to cut taxes immediately. Last week, Hunt signaled he would stick with his tax hikes but said Brexit would help Britain to become a leader in fast-growing sectors such as the digital technology and green energy while reforms of the labor market would also boost growth. For 2024, the IMF predicted Britain’s economy would grow by 0.9%, a 0.3-percentage-point increase from October’s forecast but still the joint slowest in the G7 with Japan and Italy. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/international-monetary-fund-world-economic-outlook-january-2023/,[],"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday, January 31, raised its 2023 global growth outlook slightly due to “surprisingly resilient” demand in the United States and Europe, an easing of energy costs, and the reopening of China’s economy after Beijing abandoned its strict COVID-19 restrictions. The IMF said global growth would still fall to 2.9% in 2023 from 3.4% in 2022, but its latest World Economic Outlook forecasts mark an improvement over an October prediction of 2.7% growth this year with warnings that the world could easily tip into recession. For 2024, the IMF said global growth would accelerate slightly to 3.1%, but this is a tenth of a percentage point below the October forecast as the full impact of steeper central bank interest rate hikes slows demand. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said recession risks had subsided and central banks are making progress in controlling inflation, but more work was needed to curb prices and new disruptions could come from further escalation of the war in Ukraine and China’s battle against COVID-19. “We have to sort of be prepared to expect the unexpected, but it could well represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and then inflation declining,” Gourinchas told reporters of the 2023 outlook. In its 2023 gross domestic product forecasts, the IMF said it now expected US GDP growth of 1.4%, up from 1% predicted in October and following 2% growth in 2022. It cited stronger-than-expected consumption and investment in the third quarter of 2022, a robust labor market, and strong consumer balance sheets. It said the eurozone had made similar gains, with 2023 growth for the bloc now forecast at 0.7%, versus 0.5% in the October outlook, following 3.5% growth in 2022. The IMF said Europe had adapted to higher energy costs more quickly than expected, and an easing of energy prices had helped the region. Britain was the only major advanced economy the IMF predicted to be in recession this year, with a 0.6% fall in GDP as households struggle with rising living costs, including for energy and mortgages. The IMF revised China’s growth outlook sharply higher for 2023, to 5.2% from 4.4% in the October forecast after “zero-COVID” lockdown policies in 2022 slashed China’s growth rate to 3% – a pace below the global average for the first time in more than 40 years. But the boost from renewed mobility for Chinese people will be short-lived. The Fund added that China’s growth will “fall to 4.5% in 2024 before settling at below 4% over the medium term amid declining business dynamism and slow progress on structural reforms.” At the same time, India‘s outlook remains robust, with unchanged forecasts for a dip in 2023 growth to 6.1% but a rebound to 6.8% in 2024, matching its 2022 performance. Gourinchas said together, the two Asian powerhouse economies will supply over 50% of global growth in 2023. He acknowledged that China’s reopening would put some upward pressure on commodity prices, but “on balance, I think we view the reopening of China as a benefit to the global economy” as it will help ease production bottlenecks that have worsened inflation and by creating more demand from Chinese households. Even with China’s reopening, the IMF is predicting that oil prices will fall in both 2023 and 2024 due to lower global growth compared to 2022. The IMF said there were both upside and downside risks to the outlook with built-up savings creating the possibility of sustained demand growth, particularly for tourism, and an easing of labor market pressures in some advanced economies helping to cool inflation, lessening the need for aggressive rate hikes. But it enumerated more and larger downside risks, including more widespread COVID-19 outbreaks in China and a worsening of the country’s real estate turmoil. An escalation of the war in Ukraine could further spike energy and food prices, as would a cold winter next year as Europe struggles to refill gas storage and competes with China for liquefied natural gas supplies, the Fund said. Although headline inflation has come down in many countries, a premature easing of financial conditions leaves markets vulnerable to sudden repricings if core inflation readings fail to come down. Gourinchas said core inflation may have peaked in some countries such as the United States, but central banks need to stay vigilant and be more certain that inflation is on a downward path, particularly in countries where real interest rates remain low, such as in Europe. “So we’re just saying, look, bring monetary policy slightly above neutral at the very least and hold it there. And then assess what’s going on with price dynamics and how the economy is responding, and there will be plenty of time to adjust course, so that we avoid having overtightening,” Gourinchas said. – Rappler.com"

Presidential Communication Office (PCO) Secretary Cheloy Garafil confirmed their appointment on Tuesday, January 31, as Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin administered the oath of office of its chair, lawyer Maisara Dandanum-Latiph, in Malacañang. Bersamin signed the appointment of Latiph and eight members of the Marawi Compensation Board on January 13.

Lininding asked the board to convene immediately and set the implementing rules for the distribution of a P1-billion compensation package for the affected residents. The board was created by a law to facilitate the tax-free payment of reparations to residents who lost residential and commercial properties during the fighting. The law grants private property owners compensation based on the sum of the current market value of their lots, and shoulder the replacement costs of structures and improvements.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-nuclear-body-joins-search-missing-radioactive-capsule/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Australia’s nuclear safety agency said on Tuesday, January 31, it had joined the hunt for a tiny radioactive capsule missing somewhere in the outback, sending a team with specialized car-mounted and portable detection equipment. Authorities have now been on a week-long search for the capsule which is believed to have fallen from a truck that made a 1,400 km (870 mile) journey in Western Australia. The loss has triggered a radiation alert for large parts of the vast state. The capsule, part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed, had been entrusted by Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX to a specialist contractor to transport. Rio apologized on Monday for the loss, which happened sometime in the past two weeks. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency said it was working with the Western Australian government to locate the capsule. It added that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has also sent radiation services specialists as well as detection and imaging equipment. The truck travelled from Rio’s Gudai-Darri mine, north of Newman, a small town in the remote Kimberley region, to a storage facility in the suburbs of Perth – a distance longer than the length of Great Britain. State emergency officials on Tuesday issued a fresh alert to motorists along Australia’s longest highway to take care when approaching the search parties, as vehicles carrying the radiation detectors are travelling at slow speeds. “It will take approximately five days to travel the original route, an estimated 1400kms, with crews travelling north and south along Great Northern Highway,” Department of Fire and Emergency Services Incident Controller Darryl Ray said in a statement late on Monday. The gauge was picked up from the mine site on January 12. When it was unpacked for inspection on January 25, the gauge was found broken apart, with one of four mounting bolts missing and screws from the gauge also gone. Authorities suspect vibrations from the truck caused the screws and the bolt to come loose, and the capsule fell out of the package and then out of a gap in the truck. The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour. People have been told to stay at least five meters (16.5 feet) away as exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness, though driving past the capsule is believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/japan-companies-lure-skilled-workers-inflation-labor-crunch-bite/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – From inflation allowances to the reskilling of workers, firms in Japan are stepping up efforts to help employees fight rising prices and a labor crunch, even though some cannot afford pay hikes that do more than offset cost-push inflation. As annual “shunto” labor talks get into full swing, momentum from both labor and management is growing for firms to offer such hikes to cushion, even if not beat, consumer inflation, which hit a 41-year high of 4% in December. At the spring session of the labor talks, set to wrap in mid-March, major firms, such as Toyota Motor Corporation, negotiate with in-house unions to set wages for the coming fiscal year from April. Labor shortages and rising consumer inflation, which is double the central bank’s target of 2%, are spurring cautious firms, with a 500-trillion-yen ($3.85 trillion) hoard of internal reserves, to hike wages. About a quarter of Japanese firms have offered inflation allowances or plan to do so, said corporate credit research firm Teikoku Databank. Such allowances range from 6,500 yen ($50) for monthly payments to 54,000 yen in lump sums, on average. “I received the money just when we had our second baby,” said Shinichiro Mori, who received a one-off allowance of 150,000 yen last summer from groupware developer Cybozu. The company offered the payment to all its 800 employees. “I appreciated the money,” Mori, 41, told Reuters. “We spent it on baby goods, utility bills, and other living expenses, as we stayed home all day taking care of our baby.” News that Fast Retailing, operator of the Uniqlo clothing chain, will revise its pay system for employees, with raises as much as 40%, provides another example. The private sector expects the drive to help boost productivity, meshing with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s “new capitalism” initiative on wealth distribution that put a top priority on wage hikes. Such demands by Japanese policymakers come against the backdrop of 15 years of grinding deflation that saw firms shelve hikes in base salary from the early 2000s to the early 2010s, when rounds of stimulus failed to spark economic growth, but piled up public debt instead. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data shows Japanese workers’ wages have grown about 5% over a period of 30 years from 1990, during which US pay rose 1.5 times and pay for South Koreans doubled. Takahide Kiuchi, a former member of the board of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), called for wage hikes to be sustained over time so that cumulative pay rises could offset price hikes in the long run. “Bonuses or inflation allowances would have only a limited impact on easing the pain of cost-push inflation, as consumers tend to save one-off payouts rather than spend,” added Kiuchi, now an executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute. The government and the central bank say inflation must grow in tandem with wage growth to fuel private consumption, which accounts for more than half the economy, paving the way for the BOJ to achieve its inflation target in a sustainable, stable fashion. But one-off payments do not make consumers more confident about increasing spending, although a rise in base pay, a salary component that is hard to reverse, is more likely to boost such confidence and set workers spending more. Real wages fell 2.5% in November, down for the ninth straight month, following the previous month’s decline of 3.8%, the latest data shows. Mori’s employer, Cybozu, has offered employees a record pay hike in the upper reaches of the 1% to 10% range this year. That would surpass the 3% target of Kishida’s government, and even the 5% sought by the Japan Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), while Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren urged companies to offer positive wage hikes, including base pay. “We always feel the need to respond to labor shortages of engineers, in particular,” said Yumika Nakane, the firm’s human resources head. “We set pay scales as we’re fully aware salary is one of the keys to attract workers.” Despite a jobless rate of 2.5% in December that reflects the tight labor market, and steady job availability, at a ratio of 1.35 per seeker, policymakers complain about the absence of demand-pull inflation that entails wage growth. At this year’s shunto talks, large firms are likely to offer the biggest pay hikes in 26 years, or an average of 2.85% for the financial year starting in April, a poll of 33 economists by the Japan Economic Research Center showed. However, small firms, which employ 7 of every 10 workers, face a severe situation, and more than 70% of them have no plan to raise wages, a separate poll by the Jonan Shinkin Bank and the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper showed. To push small firms in this direction, authorities want to improve labor productivity and encourage more workers to switch to industries with better prospects for growth, provided that they will not lack for employment. Kishida’s government plans to tap 1 trillion yen over the next five years in human resources, providing new support for firms hiring mid-career workers as well as for reskilling efforts to spur labor turnover. Workers have high expectations from this year’s labor talks, which they hope will counter cost-push inflation while tackling the tight labor market to help boost the economy. Some companies are ready to take the initiative. For instance, Internet media firm Cyberagent’s “reskilling center” has trained 200 information technology engineers, upgrading their skills to match its needs, besides wooing engineers from outside. From this spring, it will also raise the starting salary for new graduates by 12% to 420,000 yen. “As the IT industry faces a lack of engineers, we can contribute to resolving the labor crunch by cultivating human resources, which is our strength,” said Hiroto Minegishi, the firm’s general manager for technical human resources. “As a result, we can help wages growth and enhance productivity across the IT industry.” – Rappler.com $1 = 129.9700 yen"

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/filipino-family-values-gone-wrong/,['STEPH ARNALDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – When it comes to family, we all have our own plights. For many, however, these “struggles” go way beyond an annoyingly noisy sibling or an overbearing but caring parent. Sadly, their family has become the main cause of their poor mental and emotional health. Different factors and circumstances may come into play, but it’s very common for traditional Filipino family values to contribute to the toxicity one may be experiencing from their own relatives. For those already struggling with family, the fact that Filipino culture is very family-oriented and community-centric may not always help. Why is this so? Clinical psychologist Abegail Joyce (AJ) Requilman from Empath explains how these age-old values – which are already so embedded in society – can actually become detrimental to our own mental health when practiced too rigidly and too much. Filipino family culture revolves around filial piety, wherein elders are honored for their wisdom and experience. This is admirable, but when elders should always have the final say, this can make the younger generation feel unheard, unseen, and unappreciated. We were told as kids that highest respects must be paid to anyone older than you, and for some, this is understood by “showing our love by being strictly obedient, well-mannered, and by keeping the family’s name untarnished by not straying away from the given status quo,” AJ said. When we inevitably reach that age where we start finding ourselves, speaking up, and expressing our own opinions, our elders may take this as disobedience, ingratitude, and disrespect. Because courteousness and taking care of the elderly are also very important concepts in a Filipino household, disagreement can be misconstrued as hostility. Our “family first” mentality is noble, but when taken to heart too much, this can put a lot of pressure on children, especially on the panganays (first born). “I’m studying/working hard for my family,” many children may say. There is nothing wrong with this, but AJ said that there are times when one has to put his/her own dreams on hold, in order to fulfill obligations to the family. “Some children who end up being the breadwinner for parents and siblings may set aside finding a partner and getting married as he/she needs to provide for their family,” AJ said. You are expected to be so giving, to the point that you end up losing parts of yourself just to meet others’ needs, until you are running on empty. This is a sure recipe for burnout, emotional fatigue, and maybe even resentment in the future. Filipino parents have the tendency to compare siblings and/or cousins to one another. “Someone is always smarter, more attractive, more talented, makes more money, than the other. Parents say this to their children to inspire them to improve and live up to their potential. However, this is usually more psychologically damaging than effective in motivating children to do well in school and in life,” AJ said. Those at the short end of the stick usually end up feeling inadequate and unworthy. This may lead to people-pleasing or attention-seeking behaviors, or withdrawing from challenging situations to avoid defeat. This can also lead to poor self-esteem, low self-worth, or unhealthy coping mechanisms to compensate for the feeling of “I’ll never be good enough.” It doesn’t help that Filipino families also have difficulty tackling issues. Conflicts and problems are usually swept under the rug, only to maybe resurface at the next family dinner or minor disagreement. When the conflict is between one of the parents and the child, regardless of who is at fault, an apology usually has to come from the younger one. Most of the time, everyone pretends that nothing happened, too. “Being honest about negative feelings and experiences inside a Filipino household is a challenge and usually, the one who dares open the conversation about it is seen as a destroyer of peace. In the end, conflicts re-occur and little fights grow deeper roots and may even transform to full blown rifts among family members,” AJ said. Elders also get some kind of immunity to wrongdoings and toxicity. “No matter what they do, they’ll always be seen as the one who is in the right, which can be unfair. It becomes a bigger problem when there is physical and/or emotional abuse going on in the family,” AJ said. Some families prefer to stay silent about the abuse happening at home, believing that the family name must be “protected” because family is “forever.” How come bullying at school or work is condemned, but if from home, it is not? This is also why some people have trouble asking for help from others. Sometimes, when a child has a mental health concern, relatives may find shame in having a family member seek professional help as others might think “something is wrong in their family home or genes.” “People find it difficult to reveal their gender preferences and identities, as they fear bringing shame to their families. Family comes first, even when this mindset becomes the detriment of their own mental health,” AJ said. In Filipino society, parents take care of their children and children, later on, are expected to take care of their parents. This is a beautiful culture when done out of love and free will, AJ said, but this could be damaging when children are viewed as “investments.” “When children are forced or manipulated to set aside their personal goals and aspirations so they could ‘give back’ to their parents by giving a huge chunk of their monthly paycheck, time, and energy, it becomes problematic,” AJ said, especially if parents use the “I raised you” card regularly, or hang what they’ve “done for you” over your head, like keeping a scorecard. The feeling of being indebted to a parent – whose obligation was to provide for you anyway – can make for a transactional relationship in the future. The cycle of obligation – “I did this for you, so you have to do this for me” – makes you feel like you have to live for others, and this can breed feelings of resentment and disdain. Filipino family culture is definitely something to be proud of, but too much of any good thing can be bad. If you can relate to most (if not all) of these “Filipino family values gone wrong,” it may be time to do something about it, for the sake of your mental health and even your family’s. You can either choose to seek professional help, set boundaries, or cut ties – whichever you feel is the healthiest thing to do for yourself at the moment. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/british-beer-maker-stockpiling-malt-try-beat-price-squeeze-inflation/,[],"WATERBEACH, United Kingdom – At the Milton Brewery in eastern England, Richard Naisby’s warehouse is jammed full of pallets stacked high with sacks of malt, a key ingredient for his traditional cask beers. Whereas he mostly used to order the grain when he needed it, Naisby is now stockpiling, buying three to four months of supply in advance to try to stave off the impact of soaring prices. “Things are going through the roof,” he said. “Malt’s gone up 40% to 50%.” Small businesses like his in Britain are being hammered by rising costs which they would struggle to pass onto cash-strapped consumers. Inflation is hovering at over 10%, close to 40-year highs, and official figures show the prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks was 16.8% higher in December than a year before. Gas and electricity prices were up 130% and 65% respectively in the year to December, the statistics office says. It has left many small businesses fighting for survival. Naisby, who says he is lucky to have a fixed contract for his energy until 2024, said he had saved himself about 2,000 pounds ($2,480) by buying as much malt as he could fit in before a supplier raised prices in January. The 50% rise for some malt types this year came on top of a 20% increase last year. “Cumulatively of course that’s very, very difficult for us to withstand,” said Naisby, as he maneuvered battered steel casks full of the real ale he sells to pubs, including three of his own, near Cambridge. He has put his prices up by 7% over the past year, but like many smaller companies, he finds himself squeezed in the middle: not big enough to negotiate better rates from suppliers and facing resistance to price hikes from buyers. The new battle against mounting costs comes after the COVID lockdowns brought many small firms to their knees. During the pandemic, the government provided support through a mix of grants, loans, and temporary tax cuts. Following the jump in energy prices, it set up a scheme to help with utility bills which runs to the end of March, with a scaled-back scheme for a year after that. But price rises are still punishing. For William Fugard from Gusto Organic, the glass bottles in which he sells his upmarket soft drinks have risen from 8 pence each to 17 pence. Over the course of last year citrus ingredients shot up by between 25% and 35% in price, he said. Emma Macdonald, founder of The Bay Tree, which makes chutneys and jams in Devon, southwest England, said that in the past year diced onions and tomatoes had doubled in price, while sugar was up between 20% and 40% depending on the type. “Half the time you don’t even know the price has gone up until you place an order,” she said, adding that the usual couple of months’ notice on any increase had been abandoned. Their experiences are a far cry from the hopeful message delivered by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey this month, who said there were signs that inflation might be starting to turn a corner after it edged down to 10.5% in December from 10.7% in November. Five miles across the windswept fenland from Naisby’s brewery is one of his pubs, The Haymakers. There he sells pizzas alongside Pegasus, his award-winning beer. Last year he sold pizzas for 13 to 14 pounds. They now cost nearer to 15 pounds because of a 50% jump in the price of tinned tomatoes. “We can’t pass on all the price rises and certainly not immediately,” said Naisby, who employs about 40 people in his pubs and four at the brewery. Together the businesses have an annual turnover of about 2 million pounds ($2.5 million). After doing the sums, he found that for small, local deliveries of casks it was cheaper to shun his big van and go instead in his decades-old Morris Minor, a post-war car whose sight on the roads today is nothing short of quirky. He said, “We’re just looking into every single aspect of the expenses that we incur to try and make a living.” – Rappler.com $1 = 0.8076 pounds"

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Seoul for talks as Washington seeks to reassure a key Asian ally over its nuclear commitment amid growing threats from North Korea. Austin met South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup, following their annual security talks in Washington in November, and was set to meet President Yoon Suk-yeol before flying to the Philippines. “In order to realize peace through strength on the Korean peninsula, we pledged to expand the scale and elevate the levels of the combined exercises and training,” Lee told a joint news conference. The latest meeting of the two came as South Korea pushes to bolster confidence in American extended deterrence – its military capability, especially nuclear forces, to deter attacks on its allies. Austin said his trip aimed to deepen co-operation on tackling shared security challenges and reaffirm the US commitment to South Korea as “ironclad” at a time of heightened tension and provocation. “The United States stands firm in its extended deterrence commitment that includes the full range of US defense capabilities, including our conventional, nuclear and missile defense capabilities,” he told the conference. Nuclear-armed North Korea launched an unprecedented number of missiles last year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US mainland.

The North’s evolving threats have revived calls from some politicians and experts in South Korea to bring back US tactical nuclear weapons or even a South Korean nuclear program, though Seoul officials dismissed such a possibility. In a joint statement, the defense chiefs added that they had also committed to expand this year’s combined military exercises, and deploy more US strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers and bombers. More than 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty. Pyongyang has denounced the joint drills as proof of the allies’ hostile intentions, and has staged its own military shows of force. Lee has said the two countries will hold nuclear tabletop exercises in February in a scenario of North Korean nuclear attacks, as they move to improve joint nuclear planning and implementation and boost information sharing. Austin said the table-top exercises would ensure that the allies saw “eye-to-eye” on their response to North Korea. The exercises are in line with the allies’ talks to expand extended deterrence activities and mechanisms on the peninsula and in the region, he added. South Korea has faced growing pressure to join US-led efforts to counter the rising influence of China, and help Ukraine battle Russia. While visiting Seoul on Monday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged South Korea to increase military support to Ukraine. He cited other nations that have changed their policy of not providing weapons to countries in conflict following Russia’s invasion. Asked about Stoltenberg’s comments, Lee said he was monitoring the situation but declined to elaborate on any military support for Ukraine. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/moveph/journalists-emphasize-need-person-to-person-approach-fact-checking/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – As disinformation continues to pervade social media platforms, journalists called on Filipinos to engage with families and peers in practicing fact-checking and being responsible with the content they consume and post online. During the launch of MovePH’s media and information literacy series on January 20, Rappler’s head of digital services Gemma Mendoza pointed out how emotions play a big role in spreading hate and lies online. She emphasized that communities can make a bigger contribution to disseminating the truth, working hand-in-hand with journalists in the movement through collaborations and personal engagements. “It is really a person-to-person approach, we need to make them repetitively believe facts until they are okay with it. Sometimes, they may not accept it, it is good to try as we need to be patient and understand that there is a system of disinformation,” MovePH head Samantha Bagayas added. Rappler CEO Maria Ressa pointed out that it’s difficult to change what people think but we can still try to correct false information and do so with empathy, respect and kindness, especially when dealing with friends and family. Ressa added that people must approach these hard conversations with patience. “If there is a fight within your family, you need to fight by love. That’s what I learned. If you fight hate with hate, we only divide. If it’s family, love them to truth and facts. Because they will win on that,” Ressa said. The problem of disinformation now needs both a personal and online approach. During the event, Ressa asserted that there is now a ”person-to-person battle with integrity and facts. That’s why we need to battle for facts.” Filipinos are reported to be social media savvy. This has become more prevalent during the pandemic, with Mendoza mentioning that Facebook became the latest news source of most Filipinos compared to newspapers. She added how social media had boosted its power and became more irresistible and addictive by design, causing Filipinos to spend numerous hours on social media. Since anyone can be a publisher online, Mendoza emphasized that the internet can be utilized as an outlet of hate and anger, causing wide information disorder and loss of trust in news. “It is essential that we need to speak truth, even if harassments are prevalent online. We need to speak truth to power because if not, abuses will continue,” Mendoza said. Ressa warned that if no changes will be made, democracy will eventually fail and false information peddlers will never be taken into account. She especially mentioned how disinformation largely impacted the integrity of the recent 2022 elections, where false information and propaganda influenced the perception of Filipinos–hindering them from making informed decisions. “In this year and next year by 2024, if there is no change in technology and civic engagements, democracy falls off the cliff. More illiberal leaders will be democratically elected and they will not crumble institutions within, they [will] already brew autocracy, pivoting to fascism,” Ressa added. Bagayas pointed out that it is important to recognize that the things we find and post online have real-life repercussions and impacts. Therefore media literacy needs to be taught and understood in both online and offline spaces. Bagayas and Mendoza concluded that in order to make person-to-person approaches possible, ordinary citizens should do their part in spreading facts – be it producing fact-checks, joining groups advocating for truth, or just simply by sharing accurate information within our personal networks, boosting media literacy can be one of the solutions to fight disinformation. One way to support this is by joining the #FactsFirstPH initiative, a one-of-a-kind anti-disinformation initiative consisting of civil society groups, academic institutions, media newsrooms, among others debunking online falsehoods, amplifying truth faster, holding perpetrators accountable, and advocating literacy. “Fact-checking is like playing a  ‘whack-a-mole,’ especially when there are so many lies…. If you spark anger and hate, you get a wider distribution. When you inspire, it also gives a large distribution like what we learned in #FactsFirstPH,” Ressa said. “Battling for truth isn’t limited to a journalist job and the media company. It is important to realize our role, working in communities. We are more connected and being part of the movement, that’s why it is important,” Mendoza added. The five-part media and information literacy series aims to bring together teachers, students, and leaders in their respective sectors who will learn – and talk about – how to be critical and discerning online. This is launched by the #FactsFirstPH initiative, through Rappler’s civic engagement arm MovePH, along with 25 participating schools and organizations in the Philippines. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/volleyball/philippine-federation-distances-men-women-rosters-sea-games-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Volleyball Federation (PNVF) has distanced itself from the reported men’s and women’s volleyball rosters for the upcoming 2023 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games that circulated around media outlets last Monday, January 30. In a statement on Tuesday, January 31, the country’s volleyball governing body said that it “could not put its imprimatur on the news – that came out in various platforms and media outlets – concerning the composition of the national teams for men and women.” Initial reports stated that the 17-person pools would be headlined by Cignal star spiker Marck Espejo for the men’s side and the recovering Alyssa Valdez of Creamline for the women’s team. “We are looking at a very busy 2023 and the PNVF calendar is packed with major local and international competitions, to name two – the 32nd Southeast Asian Games in Cambodia in May and the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, in September,” the PNVF said. “There, too, are other major international events where our national teams would be participating. As such, the PNVF has to be meticulous in the selection of the members of the national teams based on what the national coaches recommend for a particular competition,” it added. The federation did add, however, that the official pools are coming soon. “The PNVF appreciates the enthusiasm of the media as shown by their eagerness to publish the  composition of the national men and women volleyball teams for this year,” the statement continued. “This only proves how healthy and perhaps how enterprising the media are as they show keen and  passionate interest in our sport of volleyball, which, the federation would like to believe, is already in the top tier among the Filipino sports fans’ well-loved sports.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/boeing-add-737-max-production-line-plans-output-boost/,[],"Boeing told employees on Monday, January 30, that it will add a new 737 MAX production line in Everett, Washington, in mid-2024 as it plans to ramp up deliveries of its best-selling plane. Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Stan Deal said in an email reviewed by Reuters that the new line will be its fourth for the narrow-body 737 MAX and is needed because of “strong product demand.” The company is reactivating its third 737 MAX line in Renton, Washington, Deal added. Boeing booked nearly 700 MAX orders last year, delivered 387 737s, and has a total backlog of about 3,600 MAX airplanes. “In addition to preparing the facility, we have begun the process of notifying and preparing our suppliers, customers, unions, and employees as we take the necessary steps to create a new line,” Deal said. The move comes as demand for wide-body jets that were previously built in Everett has been under pressure, despite a partial recovery. It was disclosed on the eve of the final delivery of the iconic 747 from the plant. The 737 line will take the place of some remaining activity on the 787, a modern wide-body jet whose production has been concentrated at another Boeing plant in South Carolina. Boeing said this month it had stabilized 737 production at 31 per month, with plans to ramp production up to approximately 50 per month in the 2025-2026 timeframe. Deal referred to a decision of Congress in December to lift a deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of the 737 MAX aircraft. The planemaker had been heavily lobbying for months to persuade lawmakers to waive the deadline covering the MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes, imposed by Congress in 2020 after two 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing had said the fate of the two new planes was in jeopardy without action from Congress. Deal’s email cited the support of unions for the waiver, including the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Earlier this month, IAM international president Robert Martinez said the union “relentlessly fought for this extension that will ensure the livelihoods of thousands of machinists in the aerospace sector.” The legislation requires Boeing to fit new safety enhancements to the MAX 7 and MAX 10 and retrofit existing MAX 8 and MAX 9 planes in the fleet. Boeing said the costs of the retrofits will be “small.” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said this month the company thinks “first delivery for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.” Airline executives including United CEO Scott Kirby and employee unions had raised concerns that a failure of Congress to act would have impacted US jobs at Boeing. Officials have credited airline unions with helping convince Congress to approve the waiver over the objection of some relatives of those killed in the 737 MAX crashes. – Rappler.com"

Ahanmisi earned the first PBA Press Corps Player of the Week honors for the season-ending conference covering the period of January 22 to 29 after keying Converge to a perfect 3-0 start. The Filipino-American guard averaged 22.3 points on 54.8% shooting to go with 6.7 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1 steal as the FiberXers claimed the solo lead in the standings after wins over NorthPort, Terrafirma, and Magnolia. Opening the tournament in style, Ahanmisi erupted for 29 points on an ultra-efficient 12-of-17 clip in a 122-92 mauling of the Batang Pier where Converge still played with New Zealander import Ethan Rusbatch. Ahanmisi added 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 1 block, and 1 steal as the FiberXers coasted to their most lopsided win in franchise history. Even as Converge switched imports from Rusbatch to former NBA player Jamaal Franklin, Ahanmisi stayed effective, posting 16 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals in a 130-115 victory over the Dyip. Ahanmisi then wrapped up the week with another solid outing as he put 22 points on a 4-of-10 clip from three-point land with 5 rebounds and 1 assist as the FiberXers hacked out a 111-109 win over the debuting Hotshots.

According to the report, while the worldwide average amount of time spent by users aged 16-64 on social media daily is at 2 hours and 31 minutes, the Philippine internet users spends 3 hours and 43 minutes on social media per day. The Philippines’ figure doesn’t hold a candle to topnotcher Nigeria, however, which averages 4 hours and 36 minutes on social media daily. Brazil (3 hours, 46 minutes) and South Africa (3 hours, 44 minutes) ranked second and third, respectively. The report by Meltwater and We Are Social also looked at time spent in other digital trends. They found that, among internet users in the Philippines aged 16 to 64, 95.8% of them played video games on any device and are thus ranked first in those terms. Comparatively, the worldwide average is at 81.9% and Indonesia, the next closest country in terms of percentage, has 94.8% of users aged 16 to 64 playing games on their devices. Despite this, it’s Saudi Arabians who spend the most time playing video games in terms of daily average time, at about 1 hour and 58 minutes a day. The Philippines ranks fifth in this regard, with 1 hour and 29 minutes spent daily on average. Thailand (1 hour, 43 minutes), India (1 hour, 41 minutes), and Egypt (1 hour, 34 minutes) round out the top second to fourth placers in this lineup, respectively. The report said 23.4% of Filipino internet users own some form of cryptocurrency compared to the global benchmark of 11.9%. As such the Philippines is the third highest country to do so, behind Turkey (27.1%) and Argentina (23.5%), and above the worldwide average of 11.9%. The report also noted that 97.9% of Philippine internet users aged 16 to 64 watch TV content via streaming services – such as Netflix – each month. Mexico comes a close second with 97.7% of its internet users in the same age range doing the same thing, while the worldwide average is at 90.9%. Filipinos are also consummate vlog watchers, ranking first globally in terms of vlog consumption with 55.6% of Philippine internet users aged 16 to 64 watching vlogs daily. Indonesia is a distant second at 33.3% and the global benchmark is at 25.5%. They are also the top-ranking video viewers when it comes to using online videos as a source of learning, with 64% watching how-to videos, tutorials, or educational videos weekly. South Africa is second at 62.3%, while the global benchmark is at 43.4%.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-pieces-writing-about-philippine-economics-10-years/,['JC PUNONGBAYAN'],"Today marks my 10th year contributing economics op-ed pieces for Rappler. How time flies! And what a blast it has been! My longtime editor, Chay Hofileña, likes to joke about this by saying this is my longest relationship yet. Kidding aside, I’m truly grateful to her for taking a chance on the unsolicited email of a 23-year-old graduate student a decade ago, and liking my style of writing about economic issues. Since then Ma’am Chay – as well as the other lovely and redoubtable Rappler manangs – showed me the ropes and taught me lots about journalism, which I didn’t really study formally. Now I’d like to think my writing is all the better for it. To date I’ve written 322 articles for Rappler (including this one), initially appearing in the iSpeak and IMHO sections, then graduating into the Thought Leaders section starting September 10, 2016. Through my pieces, I’ve captured some pretty big developments and shifts in Philippine economics and politics. Let me share with you 10 pieces that encapsulate that journey. 1. Kasambahay Law: Its unintended consequences (January 31, 2013) The article that started it all. For one reason or another, I felt strongly about this piece of legislation when it was signed into law by the late former president Benigno Aquino III on January 18, 2013. Applying (rather naively, I admit) basic lessons from microeconomics, I argued that legislating the wages of househelps or kasambahay might lead to some of them becoming unemployed if their employers’ couldn’t afford it. Unfortunately, years later, the implementation of the Kasambahay Law remains poor. Although there are now help desks in DOLE regional offices catering to househelps specifically, many househelps remain unaware of the benefits they’re entitled to under the law. Many employers are also not complying. Monitoring of househelp remains difficult because of DOLE’s lack of staff, as well as the difficulty of gaining access to many househelps’ areas of work. Economists’ understanding of the minimum wage has also drastically shifted since then. Whereas before economists were deathly afraid of minimum wage hikes (because they supposedly lead to unemployment), the empirical evidence for that is a lot weaker now. In certain contexts, higher minimum wages may even lead to higher employment. The lessons: just because a law is approved doesn’t mean it will be implemented, and the feared of unintended consequences will pan out. (Maybe the poor implementation itself is also an unintended consequence?) Also, don’t take textbook economic models and theories too seriously. 2. Marcos years marked ‘golden age’ of PH economy? Look at the data (March 5, 2016) This piece was inspired by the BusinessWorld piece of my former professor, Dr. Emmanuel de Dios of the UP School of Economics, on the same topic. After reading that, I decided to dig deeper, and that got me obsessed about Martial Law economics. I discovered for myself that there’s a ton of empirical data showing that Martial Law was not the country’s “golden age,” and in this piece I shared some of those data. At that time, I was elated by the splash this article made. But I overestimated the power of data to change people’s minds about an issue, and underestimated the strength of the Marcoses’ propaganda machine, the social media echo chambers, and the cognitive biases that could lead people to prefer falsehoods to truth. Since then Martial Law economics has been a key research interest. In February 2023, I will be publishing my first book – False Nostalgia: The Marcos Golden Age Myths and How to Debunk Them – combining 7 years’ worth of research on Martial Law economics. The starting point of that journey was this Rappler piece. 3. Free tuition alone won’t make college any more accessible (March 9, 2017) Through my pieces, I get to indirectly participate in legislative debates and proposals. One of the memorable pieces of legislation in the past years was the free tuition law, that made college education free in all state universities and colleges, as well as local ones. Using past research and government data, I showed that the richest fifth of tertiary students are overrepresented vis-à-vis the poorest fifth. So, arguably, the free tuition law stands to give billions worth of subsidies to rich kids who can actually afford to pay for college tuition. What a waste! This subsidy of course posed as a fiscal strain: why should the government subsidize the rich this way? I remember receiving praise from colleagues saying the original article (there was also a follow-up piece in 2019) was a great use of statistics to argue for sound economics. But I remember receiving a lot of flak as well on Twitter from those from the Left (especially the young ones), saying I should stop spewing such “neoliberal” BS. The attacks were so intense I had to leave Twitter for a few days and let things subside. As with many legislative proposals, politics and populism trump economics. Former president Rodrigo Duterte signed the free tuition law in August that year. I realized then that my pieces can be quite triggering for some groups ascribing to certain closely held narratives or ideologies. But so long as I’m using data and evidence to back up my claims, I should be fine. 4. Why is Philippine inflation now the highest in ASEAN? (September 6, 2018) Discussing macroeconomic statistics and trends is a recurring theme of my Rappler pieces. In fact, macro developments have significantly shifted my teaching and research interests in this direction (vis-à-vis microeconomics). One of the more memorable trends I wrote about was the spell of high inflation in 2018. That year inflation reached a nine-year high, and was also the highest inflation rate in ASEAN around September and October. I had fun triangulating the reasons for this, with factors ranging from the rice shortage brought about by the Duterte administration, the rising trade deficit, inflation expectations, and the ill timing of the TRAIN law, which raised excise taxes just as world oil prices were rising. I also rebutted claims by the Duterte economic managers then that rising inflation was “not alarming” and “quite normal in a fast-growing economy.” Such rebuttals have irked the economic managers a number of times, based on reports from my friends in different agencies. Little do those officials know that I receive a lot of positive feedback (even encouragement) as well from many economist colleagues, who are just constrained from speaking out in one way or another. 5. Dengvaxia scare: How rumors caused viral outbreaks (January 16, 2019) I use my Rappler pieces to show that economics can be related to other fields of study, such as public health. I particularly liked writing this piece about the ill effects of the Dengvaxia scare perpetrated by certain personalities of the Duterte administration. In a nutshell, disinformation surrounding the new dengue vaccine spilled over to other vaccines, and parents ended up not having their children take basic shots for measles and like diseases. Hence, all sorts of otherwise preventable epidemics spread across the country. The opening sentence captured it rather nicely: “Fake news can kill, and the Dengvaxia scare is a perfect example of it.” This was a perfect illustration of so-called “negative externalities” in economics. And I remember incorporating this piece in my microeconomics classes back then. Little did we know that the Dengvaxia scare would presage the even greater troubles wrought by the global pandemic just one year later. 6. Dismal PISA rankings: A wake-up call for Filipinos (December 4, 2019) Education issues have always been close to my heart, and I was particularly devasted by news that we ranked so poorly in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Specifically, we ranked dead last in reading, and second to last in math and science. Later, even more bad news came when we also ranked dead last in the 2019 TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study). Meanwhile, the first ever Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics in 2019 also showed that 9 in 10 schoolchildren in the Philippines can’t read basic texts. Long story short, we’re experiencing a full-blown education crisis – undoubtedly worsened by the pandemic, what with the extremely long school closures and the “learning losses” from online classes. I argued that all these studies ought to be a wake-up call for Filipinos. But the attitude from education officials has been characterized by denialism and gaslighting. The Department of Education, for instance, complained that they were not consulted for a World Bank education report. After that, the World Bank took down their report from their website. I wrote about this in “8 facts from WB education report they don’t want you to read.” 7. Why Filipinos need to stay at home until June (or even longer) (March 19, 2020) By far my most viral piece ever (pun unintended). I wrote about this days after Duterte imposed the first COVID lockdown nationwide. At the time, everyone was at a loss about what’s going on, and nobody knew until when Duterte’s strict lockdowns would last. I saw some analyses on Facebook by experts in biomedical data and biostatistics, showing the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases that necessitates prolonged lockdowns up to at least June that year. This was quite concerning to a lot of people: many people thought the lockdowns would just last days or a few weeks. But little did we know that the lockdowns would be a lot longer than that, with some form of mobility restrictions lasting up to 2 years or more, with varying degrees of strictness nationwide (I discovered recently that the lockdowns were very severe in places like Camiguin Island). Also, the lockdowns would turn out to be a political tool of the Duterte administration to subjugate people, especially the poor. COVID would dominate a lot of my Rappler pieces since then: constituting maybe a fourth of all my pieces, ranging from the economics of lockdowns, the health versus economy trade-off, the inadequate and slow distribution of economic aid, the glacial pace of vaccination, the Duterte government’s wrong budget priorities (I collaborated a lot with my friends Zy-za Suzara and Luis Abad on this topic), and pandemic-related corruption (e.g., Pharmally). Fast-forward to 2023, our lives are normalizing now. But I’m glad to be able to document the economics of the pandemic through Rappler; later I might just write a book about it. 8. 10 Build, Build, Build projects that started in previous admins (June 23, 2021) My Rappler columns are often a venue to debunk some of the lies and misconceptions said by government officials. And quite a few people look forward to my pieces when it comes to economic mistruths. The Duterte administration was particularly fond of boasting about its “flagship” economic project, an infrastructure spending spree called “Build, Build, Build” (BBB). However, upon closer inspection, many of projects under BBB were in fact started by previous administrations. My friend Zy-za Suzara, formerly with the Department of Budget and Management, co-wrote this piece with me on the rampant credit-grabbing of the Duterte administration. Some other pieces I wrote on economic lies include those about the “Duterte Legacy,” the statistics behind the war on drugs, the TRAIN law, and the recurring claim that we would soon be an “upper-middle income country” (we’re still not). 9. Malubha ang state of the nation (July 23, 2021) Up until the middle of 2021, I’ve been writing almost exclusively in English. But months before the pivotal 2022 elections, there was growing concern about the looming possibility of another Marcos presidency. And I figured I needed to write more in Filipino (if not exclusively in Filipino) to try to reach a wider audience with my economics pieces, especially those that would figure in the electoral debates and discussions. I started with this piece, on the last State of the Nation Address of former president Duterte. Writing in Filipino was quite liberating for me: I could write quicker, and I could use the nuances of everyday language in a way I couldn’t do with English. For instance, I found myself incorporating more jokes and witticisms, as well as pop culture references. Most of all, I discovered that there was indeed a huge reader base of articles in Filipino: interactions and engagement with my pieces blew up. I wrote in Filipino until end of 2022, and switched back to English just recently. But I may still put in some Filipino pieces here and there. 10. Budol of the century (May 12, 2022) Even if my column is primarily about economics, I can’t avoid writing about politics from time to time. This piece was written a few days after the 2022 elections, when the partial and unofficial results showed that another yet Marcos would sit in Malacañang. Apart from showing some of the election results across the regions, I explored possible reasons for the landslide win of the teamup between Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte. These include intense regionalism (which pervades much of everyday life, culture, and politics), “networked disinformation,” historical distortions, and the broken educational system. These are pretty much the same issues that led to the landslide win of administration senators in the 2019 midterm elections, which I also wrote about in “Why is Duterte still so popular?” All in all, writing for Rappler in the past decade has been an unalloyed boon for me and my career. My writing has made me grow as a writer and economist, and I’ve also made a ton of new friends along the way. (I’ve irked some people, too, from all sides of the political spectrum. But I guess that’s an occupational hazard, and one more measure of the impact of one’s writing.)

https://www.rappler.com/business/super-rich-chinese-set-sights-singapore/,[],"SINGAPORE – Like many rich Chinese, graduate student Zayn Zhang thinks Singapore could be ideal to park his family’s wealth. He’s hoping that studying at a university in the Asian financial hub will lead to permanent residency and while the 26-year-old hits the books, his wife is out looking for a S$5-million to S$7-million ($4 million to $5 million) penthouse. “Singapore is great. It is stable and offers a lot of investment opportunities,” Zhang told Reuters at a business and philanthropy forum here late last year. His family might establish a Singapore family office to manage its wealth in the future, he added. Hosting discussions on topics like family wealth and sustainable investing, the forum at Singapore’s Shangri-La hotel was attended by hundreds of wealthy people, many bedecked in designer gear from Hermes belt buckles to monogrammed Gucci shawls and the latest Dior bags. Several Chinese attendees said they had recently relocated to Singapore or were thinking of doing so. With its tax-friendly regime and seen as politically stable, Singapore has long been a haven for ultra-rich foreigners. But it has seen a fresh influx of wealth since 2021 after it became one of the first Asian cities to significantly ease pandemic restrictions and as many Chinese became disillusioned with their country’s draconian COVID policies. That disenchantment propelled Zhang, who gained Hong Kong residency in 2021, to look at Singapore. “We just lost patience over time,” he said, describing the lengthy quarantines he had to endure when traveling between Hong Kong and mainland China. Political turmoil in Hong Kong has also been disheartening, he added. Singapore’s number of family offices – which handle investments, taxation, wealth transfer, and other financial matters for the super rich – surged to about 700 in 2021 from 400. Well-known Singapore family offices include those set up by James Dyson of vacuum cleaner fame, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, and Zhang Yong, founder of China’s Haidilao hotpot restaurant chain. Though fresher statistics are not available, those involved in the industry said interest in family offices picked up in 2022 and is expected to continue unabated this year. China’s abandonment of zero-COVID policies is not expected to change the trend, given concern among the country’s rich about President Xi Jinping’s common prosperity drive that aims to reduce inequality, they added. Chung Ting Fai, a lawyer who helps set up family offices, said in late 2022, he had one inquiry a week from people who want to move at least $20 million into Singapore. That’s up from about an inquiry a month in 2021, while in January this year, he received two inquiries a week. Many are parents looking to obtain permanent residency for their children, he said, noting inquiries also came from Japanese and Malaysian potential clients in addition to Chinese. Part of Singapore’s attraction for the rich is its government-administered global investor program under which people who invest at least S$2.5 million in a business, a fund, or a family office can apply for permanent residency. Grace Tang, executive director at Phillip Private Equity which operates one of two global investor program funds in Singapore, said her new year has been filled with meetings with potential investors, most of them Chinese. While some are setting up family offices, others are setting up business headquarters in Singapore or investing in funds domiciled in Singapore, she said. Singapore’s assets under management grew 16% to S$5.4 trillion in 2021 – the latest year for which data is available. More than three-quarters of that originated outside Singapore, with just under a third coming from other Asia-Pacific countries. The influx of wealth is part of a wider trend of people returning to Singapore after an exodus of expatriates during the pandemic. Last year, the city had 30,000 more permanent residents and 97,000 more foreigners on a work or other long-term visa, boosting its population to 5.64 million. Singapore’s new additions sent rents surging 21% in the first nine months of last year. Home prices have also jumped over the past two years with mainland Chinese buyers continuing to be the top foreign buyers of expensive private properties. Another telling sign of how private wealth is flowing in is skyrocketing golf club memberships. The cost of membership to Singapore’s prestigious Sentosa Golf Club has hit S$880,000 for foreigners, more than double 2019 levels, according to club membership brokerage Singolf Services. Desmond Teo, Asia Pacific family enterprise leader at consulting firm EY, said the inflows of money support Singapore’s financial services sector and startups, creating a “rich ecosystem” that makes the country more attractive to new stakeholders. “When you hit a certain critical mass, the critical mass itself is an attraction,” he said. – Rappler.com $1 = 1.3110 Singapore dollars"
https://www.rappler.com/science/earth-space/explainer-what-expect-green-comet-2023/,[],"A green-hued comet that has been lurking in the night sky for months is expected to be the most visible to stargazers this week as it gradually passes Earth for the first time in about 50,000 years. The cosmic visitor will swing by our planet at a distance of about 26.4 million miles (42.5 million km). Here is an explanation of comets in general and this one in particular. Nicknamed “dirty snowballs” by astronomers, comets are balls of ice, dust and rocks that typically hail from the ring of icy material called the Oort cloud at our solar system’s outer edge. One known comet actually originated outside the solar system – 2I/Borisov. Comets are composed of a solid core of rock, ice and dust and are blanketed by a thin and gassy atmosphere of more ice and dust, called a coma. They melt as they approach the sun, releasing a stream of gas and dust blown from their surface by solar radiation and plasma and forming a cloudy and outward-facing tail. Comets wander toward the inner solar system when various gravitational forces dislodge them from the Oort cloud, becoming more visible as they venture closer to the heat given off by the sun. Fewer than a dozen comets are discovered each year by observatories around the world. This comet last passed Earth at a time when Neanderthals still inhabited Eurasia, our species was expanding its reach beyond Africa, big Ice Age mammals including mammoths and saber-toothed cats roamed the landscape and northern Africa was a wet, fertile and rainy place. The comet can provide clues about the primordial solar system because it formed during the solar system’s early stages, according to California Institute of Technology physics professor Thomas Prince. The green comet, whose formal name is C/2022 E3 (ZTF), was discovered on March 2, 2022, by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility telescope at Caltech’s Palomar Observatory in San Diego. Its greenish, emerald hue reflects the comet’s chemical composition – it is the result of a clash between sunlight and carbon-based molecules in the comet’s coma. NASA plans to observe the comet with its James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which could provide clues about the solar system’s formation. “We’re going to be looking for the fingerprints of given molecules that we can’t access from the ground,” said planetary scientist Stefanie Milam of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “Because JWST’s so sensitive, we’re expecting new discoveries.” Using binoculars during a clear night, the comet can be seen in the northern sky. On Monday, January 30, it appeared between the Big Dipper and Polaris, the North Star. And on Wednesday, February 1, it was positioned to appear near the constellation Camelopardalis, bordered by Ursa Major, the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper. Finding a remote location to avoid light pollution in populated areas is key to catching a nice view of the comet as it journeys past our planet heading away from the sun and back toward the solar system’s outer reaches. – Rappler.com"

The well-loved Filipino kakanin moves down three spots from last year’s 13th ranking. This year, bibingka has a 4.4 rating, besting other famous desserts like Spain’s Basque Cheesecake, Tres Leches Cake, Coconut Cake, the French Kouign-Amann, USA’s Mississippi Mud Pie, Australia’s Lamington, and the UK’s Victoria Sponge and Lemon Drizzle Cake. Russia’s Medovik lands in first place this year, a multi-layer “honey cake” that uses honey and smetana or condensed milk, as well as flour, sugar, and eggs. In fourth place is the Japanese cheesecake, followed by Argentina’s Chocotorta, Poland’s Karpatka, Marcinek, and USA’s New York-Style Cheesecake and Molten Chocolate Cake in 12th and 13th places, respectively. In its simplest form, bibingka typically consists of rice flour, water, eggs, coconut milk, butter, cheese, and shaved coconut, with the modern addition of red egg slivers, among other sweet and savory toppings. According to Taste Atlas, bibingka was initially prepared in clay pots that were lined with banana leaves, which would “impart a distinctive, smoky flavor to the dish.” “This original Filipino delicacy is usually associated with Christmas time, and it is traditionally enjoyed after the mass on Christmas Day. Bibingka is also often served for breakfast,” Taste Atlas added.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/remulla-response-lawyers-invented-cases-hold-japanese-nationals-philippines/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla revealed during a press conference on Tuesday, January 31, that some lawyers file “invented” and “contrived” complaints to deliberately hold some Japanese in the country. “We are of the impression that these cases were invented or are not real cases. They were contrived cases filed against them just to keep them in the Philippines. And that they just used this law because it is a very, very well-debated law and a very, very popular law among activists. That’s why they used the law to file cases against the Japanese subjects,” Remulla said. The briefing was in relation to four Japanese with outstanding warrants in Japan currently under the Bureau of Immigration’s (BI) custody. The DOJ said the Japanese government had requested for their deportation. Remulla explained that some of lawyers specifically use Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004. The DOJ chief said they discovered the scheme when they deported two Chinese nationals who had contrived cases that were later dismissed. Under current rules, foreigners cannot be deported if they have outstanding cases in the country, according to Remulla. “I speak from experience, not from the way things have been running in the country on these cases. There are lawyers who specialize in these cases and many of them will lose their license if they continue doing this. We would file cases even against the lawyers if they will insist on filing cases, which are contrived,” he said. Of the complaints and/or cases filed against the Japanese, one has already been dismissed (estafa), while the other three pending are alleged violation of the anti-violence against women and children law, he said. Remulla added that the scheme is part of alleged corruption hounding the immigration bureau. He also noted they will file complaints and disbarment cases against lawyers involved in the alleged crime. “It’s part of the corruption ring that operates within the Bureau of Immigration. All of these legal services being offered by law offices do not stop at tactics, which are not supposed to be used in cases like this. But many lawyers think that it’s okay to do that, but the Department of Justice will not tolerate behaviors like these from lawyers,” the DOJ secretary said. During the briefing, Remulla also revealed that authorities had confiscated cellphones, including iPhones, from the Japanese detained by the BI. As of January 30, there were 17 Japanese under the bureau’s custody. He added that authorities were able to confiscate at least six iPhones from a Japanese set for deportation. The Philippine government aims to deport at least two of the foreigners by the end of the week, Remulla said. In an interview with reporters on Monday, January 30, the DOJ chief said they have yet to identify which of the 17 Japanese in custody is “Luffy.” Yuki Watanabe, who went by the name of the famous Anime character, is the suspected leader behind at least 20 robberies in Japan.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/germany-pledge-fund-help-brazil-defend-amazon-rainforest/,[],"BRASILIA, Brazil – Germany on Monday, January 30, pledged 200 million euros ($217 million) to help Brazil defend the Amazon rainforest, a global ecosystem devastated during years of rule under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The sum, in credits and donations, was announced in the capital Brasilia where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz became the first Western leader to visit since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sworn in on January 1. The visit was a show of German support for Brazilian democracy following riots by supporters of Bolsonaro, Lula’s far-right predecessor, Scholz told a news conference. Germany’s Development Minister Svenja Schulze told reporters the German government recognized Brazil’s new leftist administration was working hard to show results in reducing deforestation in its first 100 days in office. The sum includes a donation of 35 million euros ($38 million) to the Amazon Fund to strengthen a billion-dollar initiative funded by Norway and Germany to protect the South American rainforest and fight deforestation. The Amazon Fund was reactivated by Brazil’s Environment Minister Marina Silva the day she took office vowing to halt deforestation in the world’s largest tropical rainforest. It had been frozen since 2019, when Bolsonaro abolished its governing board and action plans. As president Bolsonaro said Brazilians had the right to develop natural resources in the Amazon. The German assistance includes socio-environmental projects to support Brazilian states in the Amazon rainforest and low-interest loans to farmers for the reforestation of their land, a statement issued by Brazil said. Silva said money from the Amazon Fund would be used in emergencies including the indigenous health crisis in northern Brazil, where the Yanomami people have been suffering from malnutrition and other diseases caused by an invasion of illegal gold miners. “I have no doubt there was a genocidal attitude towards indigenous communities,” she said, blaming the Bolsonaro administration for the neglect.

Muhammad led all scorers with a 37-point, 11-rebound eruption in just 24 minutes of action as his fellow ex-NBA brother Nick Young was reduced to a spectator in street clothes after a quiet 3-point outing last game against Al Nasr Libya.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/kid-biting-hitting-kicking-what-do/,[],"Everyone with young children experiences parenting challenges. And these are often exacerbated by parental exhaustion, financial or relationship difficulties, and work stress. I’m a clinical child psychologist who runs a clinic for parents experiencing difficulty parenting young children. One of the first questions parents ask us is, “Do I need help?” If there is more stress than enjoyment for you in being a parent, or you are becoming increasingly reactive or angry, or struggling to find things that work in your situation, the answer may be “yes.” When parents come and see us, they might tell us their child is kicking or biting or screaming. Or they might say their child is anxious, worried, or reticent. They might also say they’re getting angry and yelling at their child. From decades of research, we know there is every chance we can improve these things. And the earlier we start, the better the outcomes. Parents who seek help are often referred into evidence-based parenting programs. The scientific evidence shows babies are born with a genetic blueprint that determines who they will become. But even identical twins arrive with unique temperaments – the outward expression of who they are. A child’s genetics and temperament are also influenced by their developmental environment. From a child’s earliest days, the experiences they have with their parents and carers influence much of their social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive development. Parents and carers are the most important people in their child’s life, and their attention is hugely reinforcing for the child – they are built to receive it, and develop as a result. It’s important families get assistance from someone who is experienced and qualified to treat parenting difficulties. But here’s how we work with families who are experiencing difficulties. 1) How were you parented? We first ask parents who come to see us what their experience of being parented was like. Sometimes they tell us it wasn’t good and now they are getting angry just like their parents did. Other times, we hear parents are so determined not to be like their parents that they have made no rules or routine. Sometimes we see kids who worry, who are anxious or clingy – and we see their parents working hard to protect them from the things they worry about. When parents come to us wanting to change their child’s behavior, change generally has to start with them – and their relationship with their child. 2) How reactive has the family become? We work to calm parents who are yelling or getting angry by teaching them ways to calm and allocate their attention away from things that cause them anger. Children who see parents regulate their emotions learn to regulate their own emotions and are better able to control their own behavior. Unregulated emotions, on the other hand, might result in the child hitting, biting, and kicking because they’re unable to calm themselves down, or because hitting, biting, and kicking ensure their parents will interact with them. 3) What are the desirable behaviors you’d like to see? We want to know about everything the child does that their parents regard as desirable. Parents can usually identify things they like – but sometimes they say there is no desirable behavior. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a child who only behaves badly. Desirable might mean an anxious child behaving without worry. For a child who runs around causing mayhem, desirable might be seeing them sitting down, concentrating on coloring in. For a child who has meltdowns, desirable might be whenever parents realize the meltdown is starting to calm. 4) How can you reward desirable behavior? We ask parents to develop new habits: we ask them to start commenting on and responding in “relationally rich” ways to all the desirable things their child does. Relationally rich means parents use verbal, physical, and facial responses to the child’s desirable behavior, so it increases. Think about a see-saw. At one end of the see-saw is desirable behavior and we want to see that go up. At the other end is undesirable behavior and we want to see that go down. We know, for most families, if parents increase their engagement of the child’s desirable behavior, it will increase. If you’re concerned about a child in your family, start by discussing getting assistance. This might be from a family GP or from a clinical psychology practice that specializes in parenting. Remember, if you need assistance, consult someone who is experienced and qualified to provide it. – The Conversation|Rappler.com John McAloon is a Senior Lecturer, Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/making-phone-calls-good-young-people-well-being/,[],"Some people might remember the days of coming back from school eager to call a friend, sometimes sitting for hours talking about anything and everything. However, today most young people rarely call each other. The very idea of calling someone or receiving a call seems to cause anxiety in many. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 it’s doubtful that he imagined how its usage would change over time. What started out as a wired medium for a voice conversation is now wireless and mobile, used to transmit written messages, photographs, and access the internet. To some extent the changing use of the telephone is positive for young people, as phones allow them to communicate with people worldwide more easily and quickly than before. Despite, how “connected” we are and how easy it might be to communicate, mental ill-health, including anxiety and depression, is on the increase among young adults. They were also one of the groups who felt most lonely as a result of the pandemic. Would this outcome have been different had they used their phones for live calls? It might have. Particularly given that that a live phone conversation can make us feel good and give us a sense of fulfilment, which continues after we’ve hung up. Arguably it’s the quality not quantity of phone calls which is important, and those which support meaningful relationships with significant others and friends can improve well-being. Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo’s loneliness theory suggests that when people feel lonely, they become more motivated to meaningfully connect with others as a remedy against the negative emotions, thoughts and feelings associated with loneliness. In 2018, the BBC carried out the world’s largest loneliness study and found that 40% of 16 to 24-year-olds reported feeling lonely. This might seem like an alarming finding, but Cacioppo’s theory suggests that there may be a window of opportunity to alleviate loneliness and keep it at bay before it becomes harmful. This is where live phone calls can help. Calling someone you feel close to and engaging in a meaningful conversation over the phone can alleviate loneliness and help young people reconnect with others. Although phone calls are not a panacea for loneliness, they can have beneficial effects. Having dialogue in real time also helps us clarify things by creating an opportunity to ask questions and listen, along with sharing knowledge and ideas in a mutual space. The benefits of this reciprocity and being present with another can help with problem solving and reduces misunderstandings, which can be interpreted as social rejection. Many of us have had the experience of getting the tone or intention of a text confused, which has sent us into a bit of tailspin. It’s harder to confuse what someone means on a phone call. And if you do, its easy to ask for clarification. As well as helping with loneliness, phone calls with a friend or relative can help regulate our nervous system and create feelings of belonging in ways which are lost when we don’t use our voices. When we make calls, we pick up cues through the rhythm of the voice, the way it rises and falls, which can help us feel safe, build trust, and create warm and cosy feelings that can support the nervous system. Trust is enhanced through positive conversation as our body chemistry changes, creating oxytocin (the love hormone) and a drop in cortisol (the primary stress hormone). The effect of a voice’s rhythm goes beyond the content of what’s said. According to American psychologist Albert Mehrabian, when a person is communicating at an emotional level, such as on a phone call, 38% of the communication is credited to the effects of vocal quality and 7% to the content of what is being said. Now we know the well-being value of making a phone call, here are some tips that might help you get started. 1. Decide if you prefer a voice call or a video call With video calls, it can be great to see a friend or family member in their own environment. This may help you to feel more socially connected and it may be easier to see facial expressions and laughter. 2. Will it be a surprise call or planned? You and your friend might like the element of surprise that comes from an impromptu call. However, if someone does not answer or cannot talk bear in mind that it’s just not the right time for them. They may be busy with family, shopping, or eating dinner. If you want to avoid this, send a text asking the friend or family member if they are free to talk and if not set up a mutually convenient time later. 3. What to talk about? You may love to talk and have lots of spontaneous ideas while on the phone. Or you may prefer in advance of the call to jot down a few ideas of what you would like to talk about. This will ensure you don’t forget things you want to say or avoid moments where you might be thinking about what to say. 4. Taking the focus away from the talk If you want the focus to be less on the talk, but still make a social connection why not try something like a video call while simultaneously playing a video game with a friend or watching something. The talk will then be governed by the game or show and take away any pressure you might feel about what to talk about. 5. Start with simple things If this all sounds too daunting, then start with simple things. Make shorter calls or interact with someone in friendly way on a business call. – Rappler.com Andrea Wigfield is a Professor in Applied Social and Policy Research; Director, Centre for Loneliness Studies, Sheffield Hallam University.

But he doesn’t need to approach me and and ask me to be the health secretary. I will be the one who would tell him and talk to him,” Vergeire told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino, when asked if she would be willing to accept the position. The career official said that going around the country and seeing the health sector situation herself for the past six months convinced her to take on the position should it be offered to her. “As all you know, I have a lot of hesitancies because of my career executive position, the tenure of this position, pero sa tingin ko, with all of these things happening, at sa lahat lahat ng trabahong dapat gawin (but I think, with all these things happening, and the work that we need to do), I think this is the appropriate time for me to help the country,” Vergeire said. Vergeire had cited her tenure as among the reasons behind her reluctance in taking on the highest position at the agency. “I have been here for almost three decades already, and I am a career official. So, if we have a term, such as the case of a DOH chief, it’s only six years. And by the time I finish the six years, I still have years left to serve. And I want to still serve until I retire,” she said in October 2022. Seven months into his presidency, Marcos has yet to appoint a permanent health secretary who will spearhead the country’s exit out of the COVID-19 crisis. Critics said that this indicates the priorities of the government. “We need a leader in health. If it is OIC Vergeire, so be it.

Bachmann, who was appointed PSC chief in late December, made the statement as he inspected facilities across the country and saw a lot of problems that could be remedied with emergency procurement. “I was also kind of disappointed with also the office, the back of house. I saw the facilities. There’s a lot of fixing to be done,” said the country’s sports minister during the Philippine Sportswriters Association Forum on Tuesday, January 31. “I will bring in a group of people in my office that will help speed up things in the PSC, be it from accounting to NSA (national sports association) affairs, to procurement, to bidding,” he added. “I’ll be involved in every single department to speed up things and so I can present to the board faster and we can decide faster also,” he added. With decades’ worth of experience of managing the Alaska franchise in the PBA, which had been renowned for its clean and efficient governance, Bachmann hopes to do the same for the Filipino athlete. He also plans to sit down with previous chairmans such as Philip Ella Juico and immediate predecessor Noli Eala to pick their brains for possible program implementation. Also providing advice is Alaska Milk Corporation CEO Wilfred S. Uytengsu, his longtime boss in the PBA, whom he considers as his mentor. He had previously said that he would bring the defunct franchise’s “We, not me” mantra as the country’s sports minister. Being a former athlete himself – he was a basketball player with La Salle and the Milkmen – Bachmann is aware of their plight, and proposed to give eligible national athletes free meals if it fits the earmarked funds from the 2023 national budget. The son of the late former Olympian Kurt assured that he will be open to every athlete voicing their concern. “I won’t turn back on sports, I won’t turn back on athletes,” he mentioned.

Four people lost their lives in flash floods and landslides that hit Auckland over the last three days amid record downpours. A state of emergency is in place in Auckland and Northland, the country’s northernmost region. With more rain on the way, Auckland has already been swamped with record levels in the past four days, and sodden ground and full rivers mean new rainfall brings increased risks of flooding and land slips. Beaches around the city of 1.6 million are off limits due to contaminated water, several main roads remain closed, and all Auckland schools will remain shut until Feb. 7. Evacuation centers have been set up across the city. New Zealand weather information provider Metservice forecast another 12 to 24 hours of heavy rain across the country’s north from Tuesday afternoon, with up to 120 millimeters (4.7 inches) expected in parts of Auckland. “It’s lines of heavy rain coming in bands…we do expect impacts during the overnight periods. So (expect) slips, further flooding,” MetService meteorologist Georgina Griffiths said during a televised media briefing. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said his government would accept his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese’s offer of help with the floods. “Absolutely, if there are ways that the Australians can help, we will absolutely take up those offers of support,” Hipkins said ahead of a trip to Australia next week, his first foreign trip since becoming the country’s leader earlier this month in the wake of predecessor Jacinda Ardern’s resignation. Auckland Emergency Management controller Rachel Kelleher said Auckland’s domestic airport was now running at full capacity, while Auckland International Airport was operating at near capacity and hoped to return to normal operations soon. National carrier Air New Zealand AIR.NZ said in a statement on Tuesday it had added additional services and increased seat capacity to help customers whose plans had been disrupted by the weather. Of the 9,000 passengers impacted by the weather, it had rebooked 7,800 as of Tuesday afternoon.

The cooperation agreement covered “procurement, installation, and operation of container loading and unloading equipment” at the Indonesian port, according to a Philippine Stock Exchange company disclosure released on Tuesday, January 31. Originally set to expire on September 30, 2013, the cooperation agreement – which was between ICTSI subsidiary PT Makassar Terminal Services (MTS) and the Indonesian state-owned PT Pelabuhan Indonesia IV – had been extended until January 31, 2023. Both parties have agreed not to renew the contract, publicly listed ICTSI, led by tycoon Enrique Razon Jr., said. “In view of the foregoing, MTS, which is one of ICTSI’s three operating subsidiaries in Indonesia, will immediately cease operations at the Makassar Container Terminal,” the global port management company said. According to ICTSI, Makassar is instrumental in facilitating Indonesia’s nickel and cocoa trade, being on the main part of the island of Sulawesi. The Sulawesi region leads the cocoa bean production industry in Indonesia, which is the third largest cocoa product processing country and sixth largest producer of cocoa beans. ICTSI, which operates over 30 terminals in 20 countries, acquired PT Makassar Terminal Services in May 2006 for $5.6 million. – Rappler.com"

The 59-year-old woman, who had come from a four-day vacation with her two sisters, was arrested at the Davao International Airport on Sunday, January 29, for dropping a bomb joke on board Cebu Pacific Flight 5J978. Police said the woman, identified as Annabelle Macose, told a flight attendant in jest: “May bomba dun sa bag ko (There’s a bomb in my bag).” The flight attendant immediately reported the joke to the captain who requested for security assistance through the Davao Control Tower. Personnel of the Philippine National Police’s Aviation Security Group, along with airline agents led by Davao International Airport manager Rex Obcena, boarded the plane to offload and arrest Macose. The rest of the passengers were deplaned and the commercial airliner was repositioned to a designated isolation bay for re-screening of all checked-in baggage and hand-carried items. The incident delayed the flight and inconvenienced passengers, many of them infuriated by what had happened. It had 221 passengers and had been scheduled to depart Davao City to Manila at 6:45 pm. The flight eventually proceeded to its destination, Manila, and departed the airport at 9:11 pm. Macose was charged with violating PD 1727, the anti-bomb joke law, which carries a fine of P40,000 and a maximum imprisonment of five years. Although described by her family as a natural comic, Corporal Jefry Sabulbero of the Davao International Airport Police warned that making bomb jokes in public places, especially in the aviation industry, is not taken lightly. Macose was cooperative with investigators and admitted to making the mistake. She was turned over to the Sasa Police Station for custodial proceedings on Sunday night. The case against her was filed at the Davao City prosecutor’s office. Sabulbero advised the public to never make bomb jokes in airplanes and airports as there would be consequences, and to always be aware of laws that may impact them if violated. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/britain-still-waits-dividend-brexit-anniversary-january-31-2023/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Three years after its departure from the European Union, Britain is yet to benefit from the Brexit dividend that was promised for its economy as it lags its peers on multiple fronts, including trade and investment. Britain exited the EU on January 31, 2020, though it remained in the bloc’s single market and customs union for 11 more months. On that day, then-prime minister Boris Johnson said the country could finally fulfill its potential and that he hoped it would grow in confidence with each passing month. So far, the opposite has happened, with a range of indicators showing underperformance compared with other economies. Opinion polls show Britons who regret leaving the EU increasingly outnumber those who do not. A survey published on Monday, January 30, by news website UnHerd showed this was now the case in all but three of 632 parliamentary constituencies surveyed. The government, led by Brexit-supporting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, says Britain is prospering with newfound freedoms. Last week, finance minister Jeremy Hunt challenged the talk of decline and said Brexit offered a brighter future with room for measures that will attract investment in areas such as the green economy and tech. Many economists say leaving the EU is not the sole cause of Britain’s woes – the country was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic – but it is a factor that can help explain recent underperformance. “It’s been more than a slow burn. It’s been a serious reduction in economic performance,” said John Springford, deputy director at the Centre for European Reform think tank. “If you impose barriers to trade, investment, and migration with your biggest trading partner (EU), then you’re going to have quite a big hit to trade volumes, and to investment and to GDP (gross domestic product),” he said, pointing to a string of dismal economic data. Britain was the only Group of Seven advanced economy yet to regain its pre-pandemic size of late 2019 at the end of September last year, the most recent period covered by data. Springford estimated that Brexit reduced Britain’s economic output – compared with what it would have been without leaving the EU – by around 5.5% as of mid-2022, based on a “doppelganger” model in which an algorithm selects countries whose economic performance closely matched pre-Brexit Britain. The government’s own forecasting organization, the Office for Budget Responsibility, and the Bank of England (BoE) also judge there to be a long-running net cost to leaving the EU. Some economists disagree with the consensus. Brexit-supporting economist Gerard Lyons, an adviser to online wealth management platform NetWealth and who advised Boris Johnson during his years as the mayor of London, said it was wrong to blame Britain’s problems on Brexit. “Our problems predate Brexit,” Lyons said, pointing to chronically low rates of investment in Britain. “Achieving the benefits of Brexit very much depends on delivering…a growth plan – how you can use your levers post-Brexit.” He criticized the doppelganger method of analysis on the basis that some smaller countries selected by the models were inappropriate comparators for a large economy like Britain. Trade and investment data point to other Brexit problems. Exports, especially in goods, have disappointed over the last three years – despite high hopes for a “Global Britain” rebalancing of the economy after Brexit. Total exports, including services, have grown by less than those of any other G7 country since late 2019. Boris Glass, senior economist at ratings agency S&P Global, said increased red tape in UK-EU trade had damaged the competitiveness of smaller British manufacturers especially, since they have fewer resources to deal with it. “It’s worth noting that the UK has more small exporters than for example, France or Germany. So in that respect they are disadvantaged,” Glass said. “If you are an exporter with 20 employees, then the burden of filling out these forms is very costly. Some of them can’t compete at all.” Business investment too has grown by less since the June 2016 Brexit referendum than in the United States, France, or Germany, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some pro-Brexit economists say such statistics ignore the fact that British corporate investment was unusually strong in the years leading up to mid-2016 and was bound to slow. But business survey evidence overwhelmingly points to Brexit as a factor behind weak investment in recent years. “It’s concerning that there doesn’t seem to be any kind of pickup in investment. And I think, in order for us to have a durable recovery from the Brexit shock, then we’ve got to see that rise,” Springford said. Britain still boasts higher rates of employment and lower unemployment than most EU countries but there are some signs that Brexit may have impacted the labor market too. Business groups want the government to relax its post-Brexit immigration rules as firms are struggling to find workers, something the BoE fears is stoking inflationary pressures. And unlike most of its G7 peers, Britain’s employment rate has yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level. – Rappler.com"

The December 2022 survey of the social research institute found that 49% of Filipinos were optimistic that their life would improve in the next 12 months. A total of 37% found it would stay the same (“no change”), and 5% said it would worsen (“pessimists”) in the next 12 months. The survey asked respondents: “Sa inyong opinyon, ano ang magiging uri ng inyong pamumuhay sa darating na 12 buwan? Masasabi ba ninyo na ang uri ng inyong pamumuhay ay bubuti, kapareho lang, o sasama?” (In your opinion, what will be the quality of your life in the coming 12 months? Would you say that your quality of life will be better, same, or will it be worse?) The SWS classified the overall results as a Net Personal Optimism score of +44 (“excellent”). With the exception of Mindanao, levels of optimism were nearly the same in all regions compared to the previous survey taken in October 2022. Compared to October 2022, “Net Personal Optimism” rose from very high to excellent in Mindanao, up by 14 points from +34 to +48. Net Personal Optimism stayed excellent in Metro Manila, only dropping slightly from +50 to +49. It stayed excellent in Balance Luzon, moving up by one point from +42 to +43. It stayed very high in the Visayas, from +36 to +37. Similarly, in another recent SWS survey rating the quality of life, respondents in Mindanao also felt their quality of life had dramatically improved in the last quarter of 2022. However, the December 2022 SWS survey found that optimism was lower among severely hungry families. Net Personal Optimism among adults who belonged to families who did not experience hunger was at excellent levels at +44. Meanwhile, it was at +42 among families who experienced hunger in general, +45 among those who experienced moderate hunger, and +29 among families who experienced severe hunger. College graduates were the most optimistic for the coming year with an “excellent” +57 score. This is higher by 5 points from +52 from the October 2022 survey. According to the SWS, 11.8% of Filipino families, or an estimated 3 million, experienced involuntary hunger – defined as being hungry and not have anything to eat – at least once in the past three months. The Fourth Quarter 2022 Social Weather Survey was conducted from December 10-14, 2022, using face-to-face interviews of 1,200 adults (18 years old and above) nationwide: 300 each in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The survey’s error margins are ±2.8% for the national poll and ±5.7% in each region surveyed. At the end of 2022, polling firm Pulse Asia released its fourth quarter survey results in December that found almost all Filipinos, or 95%, were hopeful for the New Year.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/bondee-app-virtual-world-imagined-life-away-expensive-reality/,['RUSSELL KU'],"In between my daily tasks at work on a Tuesday morning, I remembered seeing stories of 3D-looking avatars with a QR code from my friends and acquaintances in my social media feed, directing followers to try a social networking app called Bondee, a virtual space created by Singapore-based tech startup Metadream. True to my nature as a chronically online person, I jumped on the trend as I made an avatar, one that resembled how I look in real life. I created a room that I’d be proud to call my own, updated the app with what I was up to at the moment through animated statuses, and interacted with the avatars of my friends in the app. In short order, Bondee took the top Philippine trend on Twitter and the app stores over the next few days. Almost everyone that I knew – whether from school or work – had downloaded Bondee onto their phones. It’s gotten big enough that meme-loving Filipinos on social media would turn their rooms into registered businesses and fast food restaurants, among others. We’ve even seen corporations hopping on the Bondee bandwagon. The hype around the app also got me thinking about similar apps that were big in the past. The sentiment led me to post a tweet about how Bondee made me miss mobile games such as Neko Atsume and Adorable Home. One social media user even shared his nostalgia for the now-defunct Facebook game Pet Society as Bondee rose in popularity. That shared nostalgia made me wonder why these interactive apps held such appeal. Samuel Cabbuag, an assistant professor in sociology at the University of the Philippines Diliman who specializes in digital cultures, says these platforms “afford us to create our own spaces as a form of communication” as users create a “more visible community” with their contacts through activities within a specific app. “It is both a nostalgia and a new thing for users as it makes us recall previous apps and platforms but at the same time offers us something ‘new’ to do on our mobile phones such as designing our own flat,” he told Rappler. However, the more curious I became, the more these questions also started popping up in my head: Can we actually afford to have many options of clothing to wear everyday? Would we be able to afford in taking care of a lot of animals? Can we make our dream rooms or home into reality? Can we be a walk away from our loved ones? The answers always lead to one answer – not yet. In reality, our road to figuring out the ins and outs of adulting and the future ahead could get murky as we are facing an economic crisis in this post-lockdown world. According to 2021 figures from Southeast Asian online shopping aggregator iPrice, Manila is the third most expensive city in ASEAN with an estimated cost of living at P50,798. That figure has since surely increased in the past year as the Philippines has been dealing with rising inflation to as high as 8.1% in December 2022, leading to an increase in prices of basic goods such as eggs and onions, among others. There were also fare increases to accommodate soaring costs at a time when commuters continue to suffer from one of the world’s worst public transportation systems. But Filipinos are not the only ones feeling the effects of the rise in the prices of goods. Deloitte’s 2022 global survey on Gen Z and millennials notes that around a third of Gen Zs (29%) and millennials (36%) respondents from 46 countries are most concerned about their cost of living. So how does that relate to the virtual world of Bondee and the games that I mentioned? These platforms appear to provide users with a momentary escape away from the harsh reality of the modern world. In quote tweets referencing my post, social media users said that Adorable Home would make them feel “normal.” They recounted their memories of it and the “utopia” they built in the game. Andrew Ty, an instructor in communications at the Ateneo de Manila University, says “the possibility of using our encounters with these to immerse and/or to escape” is part of a recurring element behind the appeal of these apps. “I think what ‘virtual worlds’ present is precisely that on top of having something to do is somewhere to do it in….People are drawn to these [platforms] because they know many others have been, and the joy is in connecting with that community,” Ty said. He also shared the importance of how our sensory perceptions draw people to these virtual world apps. “Those apps are well designed. Very pretty to play. So that draws people in. ‘Oh so cute. What’s that?’ is a bigger draw than ‘Oh, wow, this is an escape from my world’ or ‘Oh wow, NFTs and the metaverse are the future,’” he adds. However, Cabbuag argued that while some may call these platforms a form of escapism from what is happening in the real world, it also “allows [users] to hope that one day everyone can afford the homes the way they want to be.” “It provides them a vision of what a liveable place looks like, albeit limited to what the app allows them to place inside,” he added. But the metaverse nature of Bondee could blur the lines between the virtual world and real-life economics. As Bondee grew in popularity, many users were concerned about the integration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into the app. According to the app’s privacy policy, users can purchase in-game currency called B-Beans to be able to buy NFT items on the platform. This part of the policy has since been removed in its latest update on January 29, even if social media users were able to catch this detail. Ty says that since these apps are accessible to the general public, they can “have a kind of control about how accessible they are.” “Something like Bondee is also freemium, so it’s free to download and play, with optional in-app purchases that users may or may not take. If they choose not to spend on it, then the game becomes more casual, literally and figuratively less of an investment,” he adds. Cabbuag also explains how platforms like Bondee “allow users to be more creative in how we use social media as compared to its early stages” as the internet transitions to Web 3.0, promising a vision of a decentralized and open Web through developments in artificial technology and the metaverse. “For me, it’s really how everyone rethinks about using platforms with these new ways of economic transactions as this is slowly becoming the norm now with most apps,” he adds, noting how social media platforms such as Twitter have integrated NFTs into their site. However, the UP assistant professor is also alarmed at how this integration could cause trouble with users as “everything can be sold and copyrighted online.” “It must be balanced with how users can freely use any content online,” Cabbuag says. As Bondee continues to use a tried-and-tested formula to attract users to its promise of metaverse bringing people together, users may want to question how their consumption of such online platforms ties in with the complex issues of the real world. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/implications-gigi-reyes-release-rights-speedy-trial-habeas-corpus/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Veteran journalist John Nery sat down with ex-Supreme Court (SC) spokesperson Theodore Te, human rights lawyer Kristina Conti, and multimedia reporter Jairo Bolledo to discuss last January 25 the recent SC resolution granting Gigi Reyes, former chief of staff of ex-senator Juan Ponce Enrile, temporary release from detainment due to the violation of her right to a speedy trial. The SC granted Reyes’ petition for the writ of habeas corpus, saying her detainment was “oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.” Te pointed out that although the unsigned resolutions normally do not hold any jurisprudence, because of the categorical language and guidelines provided on how similar cases will be treated in the future, such cases may make the same claim. “This case could apply even to others similarly situated to Mrs. Reyes,” Te said. “Of course, the way to do that is for others to file…invoking this ruling, and hoping that the Supreme Court will grant their petition anchored on this ruling.” Only then can it be affirmed as jurisprudence. Could this apply to then-senator Leila de Lima, who has been detained for six years for drug charges? Conti said that in cases such as Ilagan v Enrile, where the guidelines in the decision referred only to that specific case, this resolution on Gigi Reyes did not. Te earlier tweeted that although the SC did not explicitly amend the rule on habeas corpus in the Reyes resolution, it could be “reasonably understood that the rule has been modified,” Te said. Department of Justice Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla earlier said that this may also apply to De Lima’s case. Both Conti and Te said that the resolution is trying to “chip” away at the current limitations set by the writ of habeas corpus – it can only be invoked during the pre-charge and post-conviction stages of a trial. “A study of the decisions of the Supreme Court recently tells us that in a way, the Supreme Court is trying to break out of some shortcomings of the law,” Conti said. “In this case, you’re allowing a detained person to be temporarily released without security, but on the condition that she has to show up in court.” Te said that due to the “limitations” set by the court through its decisions, lawyers hardly ever avail of the writ of habeas corpus. “I think this decision and previous decisions on habeas corpus, for example, have been trying to chip away at some of the limitations on habeas corpus,” Te said. “This might represent a shift, and I think the court [is] signaling that ‘yeah, we are opening it up a little bit, try your luck.'” In terms of Reyes’ trial moving forward, Bolledo said that we have to wait and see when the next scheduled hearing will be. She will also be allowed to travel, subject to permission. Bolledo also said that the SC resolution would help bring back public interest in the pork barrel case, where trials are still ongoing. “On the other hand, itong case ni Gigi Reyes would shed light din and would reintroduce the ongoing trial din ng mga iba pang accused dito sa plunder case,” he said. (…this case of Gigi Reyes would shed light too and would also reintroduce the ongoing trial of the others who are accused in the plunder case.) “Kasi parang nakalimutan na ng mga tao na (I think people are forgetting that) in fact, our chief presidential legal counsel [Enrile] is still facing trials for alleged plunder.” Enrile was released from detention on humanitarian bail, thanks to lawyer Estelito Mendoza, who is also handling Reyes’ case.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/bangsamoro-women-ask-no-more-consultations-english/,[],"COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Women’s groups in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) called on their legislators to hold non-English public consultations and use technical terms sparingly as they draft a new electoral law for the special region in the Southern Philippines, noting the high illiteracy rates in the Muslim-majority territory. The groups said their active participation in legislation and governance can contribute to creating quality codes that are acceptable to all and that it is best understood if the draft legislation is translated into the vernacular. The women’s groups have presented their observations during a series of consultations conducted by the regional government on the draft legislation. The organized Bangsamoro women said their inclusion in moral governance and peace and development programs is crucial, but communication barriers have made it difficult for many women to understand and participate in the legislative process. “We have to admit there exists a communication gap,” said Faija Taalil, a commissioner of the Bangsamoro Women Commission (BWC) in Basilan. “Sad to say, many of our women could not understand English, and because of that, they are not as interested,” she added. The Philippines has a relatively high illiteracy rate, particularly among women in rural areas, and the situation is severe in the Bangsamoro region, one of the poorest and least developed areas of the country. Factors such as lack of access to education, cultural attitudes toward women’s education, poverty, and years of armed conflict all contributed to the high rates of illiteracy among women in the region. Bangsamoro Deputy Speaker Omar Yasser Sema acknowledged the problem and said the region’s officials would work with local governments to bridge the gap and ensure effective communication with women in remote communities. Ranisa Salahuddin, a BWC commissioner in Tawi-Tawi, said, “Legislators use technical terms that ordinary folks in the countryside do not understand. If these are in the vernacular, people will surely show interest and will actively participate in moral governance.” Organizations such as the Mindanao Mindanao Organization for Social and Economic Progress (MOSEP) and the Asia Foundation have collaborated with the BWC to help develop a communication plan to involve women in legislation using workable communication channels. Their goal is to ensure active participation from women’s sectors and to promote their interests and rights. Rahima Silongan, BWC’s executive assistant, said the commission’s programs include community gender awareness, giving every Bangsamoro woman a platform where they can express their views and take on issues that will, in the end, affect them. “Letting them know their roles – the women and the men – is empowering them and giving them roles to play in achieving genuine peace and development in their communities,” Silangan said. Hadja Samaona Una of the BWC in Lanao del Sur said the program is aimed at raising awareness among people at the grassroots level, especially the wives and families of former secessionist combatants in the communities. The Bangsamoro Parliament’s Rules Committee has been holding consultations to draft the proposed electoral code for the region, with a focus on ensuring fair representation for the people. Sema has presided over public consultations in Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte, where local governments, academic institutions, civil society groups, NGOs, and the women and youth sector expressed strong support for the proposed code. All inputs and position papers would be compiled and submitted to the committee in February. Since 2022, public consultations have also taken place in Manila, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Cotabato City. The proposed Bangsamoro Electoral Code outlines the principles for the scheduled 2025 regional elections, which will have 80 members – 50% from party representatives, 40% from district representatives, and 10% from sectoral representatives. Based on the proposal, one seat each has been reserved for the women, youth, traditional leaders, and ulama sectors, while two seats are for non-Moro indigenous and settler communities. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/what-we-know-so-far-luffy-roberries-japanese-fugitives-philippines/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – Japanese police have drawn connections between a string of robberies that have hit 14 prefectures across Japan and several of its citizens currently detained in an immigration facility in the Philippines. The case of Yuki Watanabe, a suspected leader behind the robberies, who goes by the name of “Luffy” – a character in popular Japanese manga “One Piece” – could well pass for the plot of a crime series. The reality, though, is anything but, as the case has again cast a spotlight on corruption in the Philippines’ immigration sector, as well as lingering gaps in its justice system. Philippine authorities, including Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla have since agreed to cooperate with Japanese authorities, who requested for Watanabe and three others to be deported to Japan. News of the robberies made headlines in Japan in recent days after police disclosed findings of its investigations. What are the “Luffy” robberies and what do they have to do with the Philippines? Here’s what we know about the case so far: Police in Japan have outstanding arrest warrants for Watanabe, a certain Kiyoto Imamura, and at least two other individuals who were believed to be involved in at least 20 robberies that took place across Japan since 2022. Watanabe, who had previously gone by the name “Luffy,” according to Japanese media, is one of 17 Japanese citizens currently held at the Bureau of Immigration’s (BI) detention center. In an interview with reporters on Monday, January 30, Remulla said Philippine authorities have yet to identify which of the 17 Japanese in detention was the man Japanese authorities had suspected was “Luffy.” “I cannot confirm that because they’re the ones, it’s only the Japanese police who can identify the person because the crimes are happening in Japan,” Remulla said. All four individuals wanted in Japan were likewise believed to be senior members of a fraud group of which 36 of its members were arrested in the Philippines back in 2019. Watanabe, meanwhile, was arrested last April 2021, Remulla said. Japanese media reports offered a glimpse of how robberies were supposedly planned by the Japanese detained in Manila. Citing findings from a police investigation, journalists in Japan said that police analyzed phones of other individuals arrested in connection with robberies that began in 2022 and found that some received instructions from “Luffy” as well as a “Kim” and “Mitsuhashi.” The phone numbers allegedly connected to “Luffy” and “Kim” appeared to have come from the Philippines. Japanese police believe the two may either be the same person or are associates. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported crime groups had turned to using overseas bases in recent years to avoid detection by Japanese authorities. In the course of its investigations, police in Japan also said they discovered that individuals who carried out the robberies responded to ads across the internet offering money to carry out “dark” part-time jobs that often involved illegal activities. After applying for the jobs, individuals were told to install Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, where further instructions were then relayed. Messages were then deleted automatically after a certain period of time. Individuals were also threatened through the app and were made to send personal information, including details on their families, to prevent them from speaking to authorities or leaving the group. Over 30 suspects have been arrested in relation to the string of robberies that have hit at least 20 homes. One case in particular saw a 90-year-old woman murdered in her home in Tokyo last January 19. Suspected leaders behind the string of robberies were able to control operations despite being detained in Manila because they had access to smartphones – an almost common occurrence in Philippine detention centers, where use of communication devices is prohibited, but not impossible, especially in cases where detainees bribe staff. Remulla earlier directed the BI to confiscate any communication devices used by detainees in its facility. “Rampant corruption is there but we have to stop it. It is something that is a job given to us, to stop this corruption inside the premises of correction detention facilities like the BJMP (Bureau of Jail Management and Penology), the BuCor (Bureau of Corrections), and even immigration detention,” he said. Both Watanabe and Imamura are facing deportation orders from the Philippine government. A summary deportation order was issued against Watanabe as early as May 28, 2021, over illegal entry to the Philippines and theft charges filed against him in Japan. Despite this, he remained in the Philippines because of a pending complaint filed against at him at the Pasay City Regional Trial Court for violence against women and children (VAWC). According to the justice department, Watanabe can be deported after the dismissal of the VAWC or after he serves his sentence if he is found guilty – whichever comes first. Imamura faced similar deportation orders and like Watanabe, also faced a similar case for violation of the VAWC law. But on January 25, 2023, the Makati RTC dismissed the criminal case against him. Following this, Remulla said the BI would enforce the deportation order against Imamura after securing necessary travel documents and clearance. Deportation may happen in a “matter of days,” he added. The justice secretary said the justice department would also review the filing of Watanabe’s pending VAWC case to determine whether it may have been filed to prevent his deportation. “Not VAWC itself but the way that the case is filed…. We have to look at the authenticity of cases filed,” Remulla said. Remulla said he hoped to resolve the issue of handing over the four suspects to Japanese authorities as soon as possible, in consideration of the importance of diplomatic ties between the Philippines and Japan. “Japan is a friend of the Philippines. It’s a matter of concern to us if they tell us that they are concerned about people who are fugitives from justice who are under Philippine jurisdiction.” Much is riding on the outcome of the handover of wanted Japanese for both Manila and Tokyo. Remulla said he hopes to resolve issues related to the case before President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s scheduled travel to Japan for a state visit in early February. As of Monday, the Japanese embassy in Manila and Department of Justice held a “coordination meeting” where outstanding arrest warrants from Japan for four of its nationals were presented to the Philippines. – Rappler.com"

According to a PEOPLE magazine report on Monday, January 30, a source confirmed that Prinsloo has given birth to her third child. Additional details, such as the name and gender of the baby, have not been disclosed. It was in September 2022 when news broke  that Prinsloo was pregnant with their third child. The model had been sharing photos of her baby bump on her Instagram.

The actor made the revelation on the Monday, January 30, episode of Fast Talk With Boy Abunda. Contis replied “Yes,” when the host asked him if Santos is already his girlfriend. “Ang samin kasi, kumbaga, what you see is what you get na naman eh. Hindi na namin pwedeng ipilit ‘yung tao to be happy for us, hindi na namin pwedeng ipilit ‘yung mga tao na paniwalaan ‘yung gusto nilang paniwalaan. Sana lang isipin nila na kung ano lang ‘yung nakikita nilang naka-post, ‘yun lang ang truth na alam nila,” he added. (For us, what you see is what you get. We can’t force others to be happy for us or support us. They can believe in what they want to believe in. I just hope that they know that they only see a fraction of the truth in what we post.) This marked the first time for Contis to address his romance with Santos since they were wrapped up in relationship rumors after his public breakup with Reyes in September 2021. At the time, Contis explained that he and Santos were only friends when they had been spotted in Baguio. While the actor didn’t mention when he and Santos became a couple, Contis cleared Santos of any involvement with his split with Reyes. He then recalled the events leading up to his separation from Reyes, confessing that he had “kalokohan (indiscretions)” and neglected Reyes’ mental health during the lockdown. “Medyo matagal na kaming hindi okay ni LJ. Pero we were together, of course. Napapadalas ‘yung away. I think it’s, kumbaga, combination na ng stress sa pandemic and everything.” “One of my biggest mistakes was hindi ko inalala ‘yung mental health ni LJ.

https://www.rappler.com/business/maharlika-investment-fund-needs-realistic-funding-sources-milken-institute-report/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Just as the Senate is set to start deliberations on the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), the Milken Institute has released a report advising the government to find “appropriate and realistic funding sources” as it structures the MIF “into a robust, independent, efficient, and effective national treasure.” “In the coming weeks, the government will decide where and at what levels it will acquire funding. Political risks accompany the use of existing government revenue funds, especially from national savings programs and pension funds,” the report said. The report also added that using funds from these pension funds to start a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) also provides no additionality since they already count as existing funding. The previous proposal to involve state pension funds such as the Social Security System (SSS) and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) drew criticism during the House deliberations on the Maharlika Investment Fund and from some experts, ultimately leading lawmakers to exclude SSS and GSIS contributions from the MIF’s start-up capital. The US-based think tank said that, instead, the government could raise start-up capital by privatizing some of its government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs), such as the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation. “In the Philippines’ case, of 108 GOCCs, from insurance and financing to charity work and gaming, the top 31 GOCCs hold assets worth $323 billion, representing half of GDP,” the report stated. The country can also tap its less tangible assets. Funding could come from the monetization of resource exploration rights, or the utilization of assets in telecommunication. “Any legislation for the new SWF should disclose how it will ‘ring fence,’ or protect, the funding, both to minimize the risk of political conflict of interest and to allow flexibility for the inclusion of new revenue resources,” the report cautioned. The report, released on Monday, January 30, found that sovereign wealth funds have helped developing economies reach national development milestones, and that the Philippines could similarly benefit – as long as structure and guidance are in place. “A sovereign wealth fund could serve as a long-term investment vehicle and attract foreign investment, thus boosting national savings and promoting economic growth and social development,” the report stated. Sovereign wealth funds can come with different goals. For instance, countries such as Kuwait and Norway created their funds as a way to use their revenues from commodity exports. But many countries, including China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and India, all have non-commodity funds. For this reason, the Milken Institute does not see having a strong commodity export as a requirement for a country to launch a sovereign wealth fund. “The Philippines may have many good reasons for launching a sovereign wealth fund. Even without natural resource revenue, foreign reserves have risen steadily over the past five years to a record high of $108 billion in 2021,” the think tank said. The report said that the Philippines could use a SWF to attract foreign direct investment, which would help the government raise infrastructure development funds other than debt and taxes. It also suggested that a SWF could boost the investment options of the SSS and GSIS. “A new SWF could also help fund existing government-controlled programs, serving as a foreign investment vehicle to the Social Security System and the Government Service Insurance System,” the report said. The Milken Institute focused its recommendations on three “crucial areas of concern”: purpose and funding, governance and operations, and investment and performance management. Aside from obtaining realistic funding, the Milken Institute also advised the government to set a clear objective for the fund, which would stand independently from political agendas. The government must expressly declare whether the fund would be for monetary and fiscal stabilization, for diversification of revenue streams, or for the achievement of sustainable development goals. “Coordination between the fund and other government agencies outlined in the current bill could accelerate industry investment, but the fund’s structure must allow for independence from shifting political agendas,” it said. Any proposed sovereign wealth fund should also have operational accountability and good governance, the Milken Institute advised. To aid in this, the government could appoint independent experts to oversee the funds to ensure political neutrality. The report cited the delegation of duties and systems of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund – among the world’s largest and most transparent SWFs – as a good example to follow. The Department of Finance welcomed the findings of the Milken Institute, saying it “highlighted the value proposition of the Maharlika Investment Fund for both the investors and the country.” The Senate will be holding a public hearing on the proposed MIF on Wednesday, February 1. Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri estimated that the bill may be passed after the Holy Week break. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/britain-unlawfully-issued-surveillance-warrants/,[],"British spies unlawfully retained people’s intercepted data over almost five years, a tribunal said on Monday, January 30, in a ruling that blamed “widespread corporate failure” at the domestic intelligence agency MI5 and the interior ministry. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which did not mention specific cases or intelligence targets in its written judgment, said there had been “serious failings in compliance” by MI5 from late 2014 to April 2019. Judge Andrew Edis also said the Home Office had failed to make “adequate enquiries” while approving the bulk surveillance warrants from 2016 until April 2019. Human rights groups Liberty and Privacy International, which brought the legal action, said the ruling showed there had been years of rule-breaking by MI5, which was “overlooked” by the Home Office. The case related to data obtained in “bulk” under the Investigatory Powers Act and previous legislation, which govern the interception of data for national security purposes. Britain has been at the forefront of a battle between privacy and security since former US security agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked details of mass monitoring tactics used by US and British agents in 2013. The Investigatory Powers Act provides vital tools to protect the public from criminals and terrorism, government and security officials say. But critics argue it grants police and spies some of the most extensive snooping capabilities in the West. On Monday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the ruling related to “widespread corporate failings between the Home Office and MI5”, which were “historic.” In a written statement to parliament, she added that the tribunal found that “it was not the case that MI5 should never have held the material at all, only that some small part of it had been retained for too long.” The tribunal also dismissed Liberty and Privacy International’s wider challenge to the effectiveness of safeguards under the Investigatory Powers Act and its predecessor. It also refused to quash any warrants that might have been unlawfully issued or direct MI5 to delete any unlawfully retained data as it “would be very damaging to national security.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-31-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Russia claimed on Tuesday, January 31, to have captured a village on the northern outskirts of the city of Bakhmut, which it is attempting to surround in a big push for what would be its biggest prize in Ukraine since last summer. There was no immediate response from Kyiv to Moscow’s claim about the village of Blahodatne, and Reuters was not immediately able to verify the situation there. It came three days after the head of Russia’s Wagner Group said the mercenary force had seized the village in an attack Kyiv said it had repelled. The village, which sits on one of the main roads into Bakhmut, about 5 km (3 miles) north, was captured with the help of aerial support, Moscow’s defense ministry said in a statement. Moscow has made clear, if gradual, advances in the area in recent weeks, notably capturing the salt-mining town of Soledar to Bakhmut’s north. Were it to force Ukraine to withdraw from the city that once held 75,000 people, it would be Moscow’s first big prize since it took the similarly-sized cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in July. During the fighting for Bakhmut, two civilians, a boy and a 70 year-old-man, were killed in a Russian artillery attack on Tuesday, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Four others were wounded in the attack, he said. Separately, a large Russian force has launched an assault against the Ukrainian-held bastion of Vuhledar this week, further south along the same eastern front. Russian officials have claimed to have gained a foothold there, while Kyiv says it has largely repelled that attack so far. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said the Russian force in the new Vuhledar assault was at least the size of a brigade, a unit typically comprising several thousand troops. The Russians had advanced hundreds of meters across a river toward Vuhledar and could make more localized gains there, the ministry said in an unusually detailed daily intelligence update. It said the assault on Vuhledar was unlikely to lead to a significant breakthrough, but could be intended to draw Ukrainian effort away from defending Bakhmut. Despite weeks of intense trench warfare that both sides have compared to a meat grinder, frontlines in eastern Ukraine had largely been frozen in place since November after Kyiv recaptured swathes of territory in the second half of 2022. But momentum has lately swung back towards Russia, making substantial gains for the first time since the middle of last year. Military experts say Moscow appears determined to push forward in the coming months before Kyiv receives hundreds of newly pledged Western tanks and armored vehicles for a counter-attack to recapture occupied territory this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described Russia’s assault in the east as an attempt to exact “revenge” for earlier losses. “And I think that they will not be able to provide their society with any convincing positive result in the offensive. I am confident in our army. We will stop them all, little by little, destroy them and prepare our big counteroffensive,” he said on Monday. Kyiv says the Russian assaults of recent weeks have come at huge cost, initially mostly relying on Wagner mercenaries, including thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons and sent into battle in waves with little training or equipment. But Russia’s call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists late last year means Moscow has now been able to reconstitute regular military units exhausted or depleted earlier in the war. Western military experts say Bakhmut is not by itself of major strategic importance. But it is one of just a handful of substantial cities in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region that are still under Ukrainian control, and Moscow now says capturing the full Donbas is a main objective of the “special military operation” it ordered 11 months ago. Since winning the Western pledge for tanks after months of lobbying, Kyiv has pressed on with further requests for arms, including calls for jet fighters such as US F-16s. Neither side has been able to secure control of the skies over Ukraine. The West has so far refused to send weapons that could be used to attack deep inside Russia, a line countries still seem unwilling to cross. US President Joe Biden responded with a flat “No” when asked by reporters at the White House on Monday if Washington would send F-16s. Still, Ukraine has held out hope. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov was due in Paris on Tuesday to meet President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters in The Hague on Monday that “nothing is excluded” when it comes to military assistance. Macron said any move to send jets would depend on factors including the need to avoid escalation and assurances the aircraft would not “touch Russian soil”. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also did not rule out a possible supply of F-16s to neighboring Ukraine, in response to a question from a reporter before Biden spoke. Morawiecki said in remarks posted on his website that any such transfer would take place “in complete coordination” with NATO. Poland has long pushed for more aggressive military support for Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said on Tuesday London did not believe its own jets would be useful. “The UK’s … fighter jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly. Given that, we believe it is not practical to send those jets into Ukraine,” the spokesperson told reporters. – Rappler.com"

He hit a hook shot and a contested corner 3-pointer that gave the Nets a 116-102 lead with two minutes left and sealed it. Cam Thomas capitalized on extended playing time at guard due to the absences of Ben Simmons (left knee) and T.J. Warren (left shin) and added 21 as the Nets shot 47.4 percent and hit 16 3s.

Authorities have now been on a week-long search for the capsule which is believed to have fallen from a truck that had travelled some 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) in Western Australia. The loss triggered a radiation alert for large parts of the vast state. The capsule, part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed, had been entrusted by Rio Tinto Limited to a specialist contractor to transport. Rio apologized on Monday for the loss, which happened sometime in the past two weeks. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency said it was working with the Western Australian government to locate the capsule. It added that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization has also sent radiation services specialists as well as detection and imaging equipment. The truck travelled from north of Newman, a small town in the remote Kimberley region, to a storage facility in the northeast suburbs of Perth – a distance longer than the length of Great Britain. State emergency officials on Tuesday issued a fresh alert to motorists along Australia’s longest highway to take care when approaching the search parties, as vehicles carrying the radation detectors are travelling at slow speeds. “It will take approximately five days to travel the original route, an estimated 1,400 km, with crews traveling north and south along Great Northern Highway,” Department of Fire and Emergency Services Incident Controller Darryl Ray said in a statement late on Monday. The gauge was picked up from Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine site on January 12. When it was unpacked for inspection on January 25, the gauge was found broken apart, with one of four mounting bolts missing and screws from the gauge also gone. Authorities suspect vibrations from the truck caused the screws and the bolt to come loose, and the capsule fell out of the package and then out of a gap in the truck. The silver capsule, 6 millimeters in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour. People have been told to stay at least five meters (16.5 feet) away as exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness, though experts have said driving past the capsule would be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/united-states-says-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-needs-limits-communications-asset-access/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – The US government on Monday, January 30, urged a judge to reject Sam Bankman-Fried’s claim it went too far by insisting that the indicted founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange be banned from contacting his former colleagues. In a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, prosecutors also asked that a bail condition that prevents Bankman-Fried from accessing or transferring assets at FTX and his Alameda Research hedge fund be left in place. They argued those assets were “vulnerable to exploitation and in need of protection from the defendant.” The requests came two days after Bankman-Fried’s lawyers proposed letting their client access crypto assets and continue communicating with most of FTX’s and Alameda’s estimated 350 employees, some of whom they said could help his defense. Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, who represent Bankman-Fried, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have until February 1 to address prosecutors’ view on accessing assets. Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on $250 million bond and confined at his parents’ home in California, after pleading not guilty to fraud for allegedly looting billions of customer dollars from FTX. Prosecutors previously raised concerns about witness tampering after Bankman-Fried on January 15 sent an encrypted message over the Signal app to an FTX affiliate’s general counsel, who could testify against him at a trial set to begin in October. “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,” Bankman-Fried had written. In Monday’s letter, prosecutors called the message an effort to “improperly influence” the general counsel, no matter how benign it might seem. “The defendant’s position of authority with respect to his former employees, combined with his recent outreach to a former employee about the case, raises a sufficient specter of witness tampering,” prosecutors said.

His trip, which included a stop in South Korea, is aimed at bolstering ties with Western allies in Asia in the face of the war in Ukraine and rising competition with China. Speaking in Seoul on Monday, Stoltenberg urged South Korea to increase its military support to Ukraine, citing other countries that have changed their policy of not providing weapons to countries in conflict following Russia’s invasion.

Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve will raise rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, February 1, with announcements on Thursday, February 2, from the Bank of England and European Central Bank (ECB), both of which are largely expected to hike by 50 bps. “The market has had a big run and the trading is a bit more cautious heading into a week which likely will be an inflection point for the overall market,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta, Georgia. On Wall Street, US stocks slumped, with 10 of the 11 S&P sectors closing lower, while Johnson & Johnson lost 3.70% after a US court rejected the company’s plan to offload into bankruptcy tens of thousands of lawsuits over its talc products. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 260.99 points, or 0.77%, to 33,717.09, the S&P 500 lost 52.79 points, or 1.30%, to 4,017.77, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 227.90 points, or 1.96%, to 11,393.81. The rate increase expected at the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting would bring the policy rate to the 4.5%-4.75% range. That’s two quarter-point rate hikes short of the level most Fed policymakers in December thought would be “sufficiently restrictive” to bring inflation under control. But futures currently expect rates to peak at about 4.9% in June before retreating to 4.5% by yearend. Markets will also grapple with a host of US economic data, culminating in the payrolls report for January on Friday, February 3. Investors see signs of weakening in the labor market as a key factor in bringing down high inflation. Other data included gauges of the manufacturing and services sectors. The US corporate earnings season also rolls on, with earnings this week expected from Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to show a decline of 3% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data, weaker than the 1.6% fall seen at the start of the year. Stocks in Europe closed lower, with rate-sensitive names such as technology shares among the primary decliners after inflation data from Spain came in above expectations while other data showed the German economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.17% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.99%. MSCI’s index was on track for its biggest January percentage gain since 2019 while the STOXX 600 was poised for its largest January percentage gain since 2015. US Treasury yields rose ahead of the central bank meetings and economic data, with the 10-year yield up for a third consecutive session. Benchmark 10-year notes were up 2.6 basis points to 3.544%, from 3.518% late on Friday, January 27. The greenback, which was poised for its fourth month of declines as expectation have increased the Fed was nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, was up for a third straight session against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index rose 0.334%, with the euro down 0.17% to $1.0848. The Japanese yen weakened 0.42% versus the greenback to 130.40 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2345, down 0.42% on the day.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/love-conjugal-visits-return-jail-south-cotabato/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – Cupid’s finally allowed back in the South Cotabato provincial jail as conjugal visits resumed ahead of Valentine’s Day. But the jailers said they would require proof of marriage and COVID-19 vaccination, and reminded couples to bring their own bed sheets because they would not be playing love games with their dirty laundry. It will be a happy Valentine’s Day – or month – for many inmates at the provincial jail as prison authorities announced on Friday, January 27, the return of conjugal visits by the legal spouses of prisoners. The visits were stopped in 2020 as part of precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among inmates. With the announcement, the inmates’ hearts are burning with love, but prison authorities advised them to tell their spouses to leave lighters at home. “Sadya gid ang Valentine’s! (It’s going to be a merry Valentine’s Day!)” an Ilonggo-speaking inmate, in a festive mood, exclaimed in joy as soon as he learned that the love visits have been allowed again in the prison facility. But the bad news is that common-law partners may have to wait, and the conjugal visits are definitely not for the unvaccinated. Lory Celeste, the warden of the South Cotabato Rehabilitation and Detention Center (SCRDC), said conjugal visitations have been allowed again, but were limited only to legal spouses. “We are still studying what to require of unmarried couples,” Celeste said. To use the South Cotabato jail’s eight “special rooms” – where inmates and their visiting spouses can just talk or spend intimate time together in private – couples would have to make reservations ahead of time. Celeste said couples will be asked to show their marriage contracts, valid identification cards, vaccination cards, and health declaration papers. This means the unvaccinated won’t be entitled to the love visits. The conjugal visits will only be allowed on Saturdays and Sundays. “We ask couples to spend only two hours in the rooms because there are many other inmates waiting in line, and eager to get in,” Celeste said. The rooms were cleaned and prepared for the love visits, Celeste said. Prison authorities said the inmates and their spouses, however, would need to bring their own bed sheets or mattresses because none of the prison staff would do the couples’ dirty laundry. The prison facility currently has a population of around 1,200, down from the 1,500 inmates in 2022. Celeste said the jail population was reduced after authorities freed about 300 inmates who availed of the jail decongestion program based on Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 201 of 2022. The circular allows the release of inmates who have already served the time needed relative to the pending charges they are facing. The program was resorted to because of the congestion being faced by most prison facilities across the country. Inmates who may avail of it are those facing charges with a possible jail sentences not exceeding four years. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-court-rejects-johnson-johnson-bankruptcy-strategy-talc-lawsuits-january-2023/,[],"A US appeals court on Monday, January 30, shot down Johnson & Johnson’s attempt to offload tens of thousands of lawsuits over its talc products into bankruptcy court. The ruling marked the first major repudiation of an emerging legal strategy with the potential to upend US corporate liability law. J&J is among four major companies that have filed so-called Texas two-step bankruptcies to avoid potentially massive lawsuit exposure. The tactic involves creating a subsidiary to absorb the liabilities and to immediately file for Chapter 11. The court ruled the healthcare conglomerate improperly placed its subsidiary into bankruptcy even though it faced no financial distress. J&J’s two-step sought to halt more than 38,000 lawsuits from plaintiffs alleging the company’s baby powder and other talc products caused cancer. The appeals court ruling revives those lawsuits. Reuters last year detailed the secret planning of Texas two-steps by Johnson & Johnson and other major firms in a series of reports exploring corporate attempts to evade lawsuits through bankruptcies. Monday’s decision by the US 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia dismissed the bankruptcy filed by the J&J subsidiary in 2021. Before the filing, J&J had faced costs of $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements. J&J shares closed down 3.7% – the biggest one-day percentage decline in two years. The company said in a statement that it would challenge the ruling and that its talc products are safe. Plaintiffs attorneys and some legal experts have argued the two-step could set a dangerous precedent, providing a blueprint for any corporation to easily avoid undesirable litigation. The appeals court decision could force companies considering the strategy to more carefully consider its risks, two legal experts said. “It is a push back on the notion that any company anywhere can use the same tactic to get rid of their mass tort liability,” said Lindsey Simon, a professor at University of Georgia School of Law. Bankruptcy filings typically suspend litigation in trial courts, forcing plaintiffs into often time-consuming settlement negotiations while leaving them unable to pursue their cases in the courts where they originally sued. The 3rd Circuit ruling does not directly impact three other Texas two-step bankruptcies, filed by subsidiaries of Koch Industries-owned Georgia Pacific, global construction giant Saint-Gobain, and Trane Technologies. Those cases fall under the jurisdiction of the 4th Circuit appeals court. 3M attempted a similar maneuver, which is currently pending in the 7th Circuit. Saint-Gobain said in a statement that the 3rd Circuit ruling has “no direct effect” on its subsidiary’s Chapter 11 case. The company said it remains confident the subsidiary will reach “final, full, and fair resolution with the asbestos claimants.” The other companies did not comment on the 3rd Circuit ruling or did not immediately respond to inquiries. All have previously defended the two-step bankruptcies as the best way to fairly pay claims. Plaintiffs’ attorneys have countered that the Texas two-step is an improper manipulation of the bankruptcy system. The strategy uses a Texas law to split an existing company in two, creating the new subsidiary meant to shoulder the lawsuits. New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson, valued at more than $400 billion, said its subsidiary’s bankruptcy was initiated in good faith. J&J initially pledged $2 billion to the subsidiary to resolve talc claims and entered into an agreement to fund an eventual settlement approved by a bankruptcy judge. “Resolving this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible is in the best interests of claimants and all stakeholders,” J&J said. A three-judge panel on the appeals court rejected J&J’s argument, finding the company’s subsidiary, LTL Management, was created solely to file for Chapter 11 protection but had no legitimate need for it. Only a debtor in financial distress can seek bankruptcy, the panel ruled. The judges pointed out that J&J assured that it would give LTL plenty of money to pay talc claimants. “Good intentions – such as to protect the J&J brand or comprehensively resolve litigation – do not suffice alone,” the judges said in a 56-page opinion. “LTL, at the time of its filing, was highly solvent with access to cash to meet comfortably its liabilities.” The decision could force J&J to fight talc lawsuits for years in trial courts. The company has a mixed record fighting the suits so far. While the firm was hit with major judgments in some cases before filing bankruptcy, more than 1,500 talc lawsuits have been dismissed and the majority of cases that have gone to trial have resulted in verdicts favoring J&J, judgments for the company on appeal, or mistrials, according to its subsidiary’s court filings. A December 2018 Reuters investigation revealed that J&J officials knew for decades about tests showing that the company’s talc sometimes contained traces of carcinogenic asbestos but kept that information from regulators and the public. J&J has said its talc does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. Facing unrelenting litigation, J&J enlisted law firm Jones Day, which had helped other companies execute Texas two-step bankruptcies to address asbestos-related lawsuits. J&J’s effort, as Reuters reported last year, was internally dubbed “Project Plato,” and employees working on it signed confidentiality agreements. A company lawyer warned them to tell no one, including their spouses, about the plan. Jones Day did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Texas two-step has garnered criticism from Democratic lawmakers in Washington, and inspired proposed legislation that would severely restrict the practice. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, cheered Monday’s appeals court decision. Whitehouse chaired the first congressional hearing scrutinizing two-step bankruptcies in February of last year. “Bankruptcy is meant to give honest debtors in unfortunate circumstances a fresh start,” he said, not to allow “large, highly profitable corporations” to avoid accountability for wrongdoing with a legal “shell game.” – Rappler.com"

Unions want to keep the pressure on the government and hope to repeat the large turnout for the first national day of protest on January 19. That day, more than a million people marched in opposition to pushing the retirement age to 64 from 62 and accelerating a planned delay in the age eligible for a full pension. “This reform is unfair and brutal,” Luc Farre, the secretary general of the civil servants’ UNSA union told Reuters. “Moving (the pension age) to 64 is going backwards, socially.” Only about one in three high-speed TGV trains will run on Tuesday and even fewer local and regional trains, while the Paris metro will also be seriously disrupted. Half of primary school teachers will walk off the job, their union said, while oil refinery staff and workers across all sectors were also set to go on strike. Opinion polls show a majority of French oppose the reform, but President Emmanuel Macron and his government intend to stand their ground. The reform is “vital,” Macron said on Monday, January 30, during a visit to the Netherlands, adding that it would allow the pension system to keep working. Pushing back the retirement age by two years and extending the pay-in period would yield an additional 17.7 billion euros ($19.18 billion) in annual pension contributions, allowing the system to break even by 2027, according to Labor Ministry estimates. Unions say there are other ways to do this, such as taxing the super rich or asking employers or well-off pensioners to contribute more. The government made some concessions in the draft bill, such as setting the new pensionable age at 64 instead of Macron’s campaign pledge of 65, and agreeing to a minimum pension of 1,200 euros a month for all. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne says the 64 threshold is “non-negotiable”, but the government is exploring ways to offset some of the impact, in particular on women. Borne said the government was looking at the impact of the reform on the additional pension rights women normally get for having children. As protesters rally across France, lawmakers will be debating the draft bill at committee level. The unions said they were trying to convince lawmakers not to vote on the bill. “When there is such a massive opposition (to a reform), it would be dangerous for the government not to listen,” Mylene Jacquot, the secretary general of the CFDT union’s civil servants branch, told Reuters. – Rappler.com ($1 = 0.9227 euros)"

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/eva-green-says-making-b-movie-ruin-career-lawsuit/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Hollywood actress Eva Green, who is suing financiers for her fee for a failed film in which she was to star, told a London court on Monday, January 30, she would not make a career-ending “B movie” that she said was cutting corners in stunt safety and crew pay. The French actress, whose film credits include the James Bond movie Casino Royale, is suing White Lantern Films and SMC Speciality Finance for the $1 million fee she says is owed over the collapse of the planned independent movie A Patriot, in which she was to play the lead role as a soldier. The production company has launched a counter claim against Green for breach of contract, blaming her for the science fiction film’s failure before it went into production in late 2019, saying she never intended for it to go ahead. Giving evidence at the High Court in London, Green, 42, said she had become concerned the film’s production team had been cutting corners, citing how her stunt training had been reduced from four weeks to five days. This was “extremely dangerous for action films” she said, and referenced the fatal 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins for which actor Alec Baldwin is facing a charge of involuntary manslaughter. “You look at what happened with Alec Baldwin on the movie Rust, the producers cutting corners, no safety measures and a young woman got killed,” she told the court. Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting, saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety. In its written submissions, White Lantern’s lawyers said Green, also an executive producer in the project, had made unreasonable demands about crew, locations and equipment. They cited WhatsApp messages from Green in which she described one producer as a “fucking moron” who should be fired and another as “evil”. She also described funders for the movie as “arseholes” and some proposed crew members as “shitty peasants”. “I wanted to make the most brilliant film possible,” Green told the court, agreeing with White Lantern’s lawyer Max Mallin that making a “B movie” could kill her career. Asked by Mallin if the director had approached her to make a “B shitty movie” – a reference to a text message she had sent about the film – for $1 million, she said she would not. Green, whose lawyers say has never breached a contract or missed a day’s shooting in her 20 year career, said she could have ensured a quality film by getting a strong core crew but the producers had not wanted to pay standard industry rates. “I didn’t want to work with a substandard crew. I wanted to work with a high-quality crew who just wanted to be paid standard industry rates,” Green told the court. Green said the script for A Patriot had been one of the best she had read and she had fallen in love with the story: “It was about climate change, it was very dear to my heart.” The trial, which will conclude next week, will determine liability with any award settled at a later date. – Rappler.com"

Michael will explore “the complicated man who became the King of Pop,” Lionsgate said in a statement. The film will include “all aspects of his life and his most noteworthy performances that set him on the path to becoming an icon in the musical world,” it said. Production will start this year and the film will be directed by Antoine Fuqua and produced by Graham King, who both said that Jaafar Jackson had a natural ability to emulate his uncle and bring him to life. “It was clear that he is the only person to take on this role,” King said in a news release, adding that he “cannot wait for the world to see him on the big screen as Michael Jackson.” Lionsgate did not directly address one of the most controversial aspects of Jackson’s story – his trial on child sex abuse charges in 2005 and additional allegations against the singer featured in the 2019 documentary, Leaving Neverland. In 2005, Jackson was acquitted by a California jury in the sex abuse case involving a 13-year-old boy. The 2019 documentary followed the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claimed they were befriended by Jackson and were abused by him from ages 7 and 10, respectively, in the early 1990s. In 2020, a California appeals court ruled that the two men could pursue their claims through a lawsuit. The Jackson family denied those accusations and the Michael Jackson estate won its appeal that year. Jackson was a child star with his family’s pop group the Jackson 5 and went on to a solo career that made him one of the most famous people on the planet before his death in 2009 at the age of 50. His hits include the 1982 Thriller album which featured the title song as well as “Billie Jean.” Jaafar Jackson is the son of Michael Jackson’s older brother, Jermaine Jackson, who is also a singer and producer. “Jaafar embodies my son,” said Michael Jackson’s mother, Katherine Jackson, in the news release. “It’s so wonderful to see him carry on the Jackson legacy of entertainers and performers.” – Rappler.com"

The watchdog, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), said it “identified 69,323 questionable Social Security Numbers (SSNs) used to obtain $5.4 billion from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (COVID-19 EIDL) program and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).” The loans were disbursed between April 2020 and October 2022, the watchdog said in its report, which comes ahead of a scheduled Wednesday hearing by the Republican-led House of Representatives Oversight Committee on fraud in pandemic spending. About 57,500 Paycheck Protection Program forgivable loans worth $3.6 billion were disbursed by August 2020, the report added. The United States is probing many fraud cases pegged to US government assistance programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program, unemployment insurance, and Medicare. In May 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. Last year, the US Justice Department tapped federal prosecutor Kevin Chambers to lead its efforts to investigate fraudsters who used the pandemic as an excuse to bilk government assistance programs. The report demonstrates “the significant fraud and identity theft that occurred under the prior administration due to the lack of basic anti-fraud controls, as well as how consequential were the Biden administration’s quick actions to reinstate strong anti-abuse measures in these emergency small business programs,” Gene Sperling, a senior adviser to President Joe Biden said in an emailed statement. The watchdog report mentioned that in 2021 the US Small Business Administration made improvements to its assistance program controls. Biden took office in January that year. In September, the inspector general for the US Labor Department said fraudsters likely stole $45.6 billion from the United States’ unemployment insurance program during the coronavirus outbreak by applying tactics like using Social Security numbers of deceased individuals. Also in September, federal prosecutors charged dozens of defendants, who were accused of stealing $250 million from a government aid program that was supposed to feed children in need during the pandemic. – Rappler.com"

The CCCC is under Beijing’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. During the meeting, the Palace said, the firm proposed a 270-kilometer Laoag City, Ilocos Norte-Rosario City, La Union, highway project, as well as bringing China’s Juncao technology to the Philippines. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, Juncao means breeding fungi with herbaceous plants. The technology is touted to “address poverty, soil erosion and desertification.” The CCCC wants to create a Juncao center and industrial park. Should it push through, it will be funded through Chinese foreign aid. The CCCC is behind some major projects in the Philippines, including the Samal Island-Davao City Connector Project and the North & South Harbor Bridge. PPPs are among the Marcos administration’s offers in enticing investors into the Philippines. Marcos, said the Palace, also highlighted how the Philippines “relaxed the rules to allow foreign contractors to bring in their own professionals with the aim of encouraging technology transfer.” “President Marcos hopes the CCCC could assist the Philippines in carrying out projects that ensure environmental sustainability in the midst of the threats posed by climate change,” said the Palace. In 2020, the CCCC was included in the US’s blacklist. Its inclusion, a senior State Department official told the Washington Post, had “various aims, including, of course, to impose costs on bad actors and to encourage all sorts of parties and institutions and governments around the world to assess the risk and reconsider business deals with the sort of predatory Chinese state-owned enterprises we have identified here.” According to the South China Morning Post, the US sanctioned CCCC’s dredging subsidiary for helping “militarize” outposts in the South China Sea. Former president Rodrigo Duterte, whose supposed gains Marcos vowed to continue when he ran in 2022, refused to be affected by the US’s blacklisting of the CCCC. Marcos recently visited Beijing for a 48-hour state visit, his first outside Southeast Asia.

The COVID-19 national emergency and public health emergency (PHE) were put in place in 2020 by then-President Donald Trump. Biden has repeatedly extended the measures, which allow millions of Americans to receive free tests, vaccines and treatments. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said in a statement the declarations, which were set to expire in the coming months, would be extended again until May 11 and then terminated. “This wind-down would align with the Administration’s previous commitments to give at least 60 days’ notice prior to termination of the PHE,” OMB said in an administration policy statement. The government has been paying for COVID-19 vaccines, some tests, and certain treatments under the PHE declaration. When it expires, those costs will be transferred to private insurance and government health plans. PHE’s expiration will also end directives, known as Title 42, that expel migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border back to Mexico, OMB said. OMB said in a separate statement that Biden would veto a proposed bill in the US Congress that would eliminate COVID-19 vaccine mandates for health care providers working on certain federal programs.

Duterte also said that most senior high school graduates have to “pursue higher education in order to find employment.” Even before K to 12 was launched in 2012, many were already clamoring against the additional two years of basic education. Despite a classroom shortage, lack of textbooks, tables and chairs, the ambitious program was implemented. Policy makers and proponents of K to 12 marketed it to the public as a curriculum preparing “graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, and entrepreneurship.” (READ: INFOGRAPHIC: 10 things about K to 12) In 2018, a study by the Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) found that the first batch of SHS graduates had “theoretically” 93% of competencies suitable to the needs of the nation’s industries, such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills. But in a separate study by PBEd, only 20% of 70 of the country’s leading companies across all sectors were inclined to hire SHS graduates. The study also noted that employers accepted only job applicants with at least two years of college education, excluding SHS graduates from consideration. Meanwhile, a study done by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in 2020 showed that most SHS graduates chose to continue their education at the tertiary level to get a bachelor’s degree. PIDS noted that a little over 20% of the SHS graduates entered the labor force and over 70% continued with their education. The report said that there was a need for government “to re-examine the employment and entrepreneurial objectives of the SHS program.” Duterte said that DepEd would focus on strengthening literacy and numeracy programs, revitalizing the Reading, Science and Technology, and Math programs by utilizing the gains of previous programs. She noted that the curriculum would be benchmarked with local and international best practices, consulted with experts, and would based on research or evidence. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/india-adani-group-shares-january-30-2023/,[],"NEW DELHI, India – Most Adani Group shares fell sharply on Monday, January 30, as the Indian conglomerate’s rebuttal of a US short-seller’s criticism failed to pacify investors, deepening a market rout that has now led to losses of $65 billion in the group’s stock values. Led by Asia’s richest man Gautam Adani, the Indian group has locked horns with Hindenburg Research and on Sunday, January 29, hit back at the short-seller’s report of last week that flagged concerns about its debt levels and the use of tax havens. Adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar fell between 5% and 20% on Monday. Flagship Adani Enterprises, which is facing a crucial test this week with a follow-on share offering, swung between gains and losses before settling 4.8% higher. It stayed well below the offer price of the issue, which if successful would be the largest such share offering ever in India. Adani Enterprises’ $2.5-billion secondary share sale closed its second day amid weak investor sentiment. The stock closed at 2,892.85 rupees, 7% below the 3,112 rupees lower end of the offer price band. The upper band is 3,276 rupees. Data from stock exchanges on Monday showed Adani has now received bids for 1.4 million shares, or just over 3%, of the 45.5 million shares on offer. The deal closes on Tuesday, January 31. Foreign and domestic institutional investors, as well as mutual funds, have made no bids so far, according to the data. “Retail participation is likely to have a shortfall with current market prices still trailing the offer price and sentiment taking a hit due to the Hindenburg controversy,” said Hemang Jani, equity strategist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “While there is a risk that the share sale does not go through, it will be crucial today to wait and see how institutional investors participate.” Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Company said on Monday it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381.17 million) in the offering. Adani Group told Reuters in a statement on Saturday, January 28, that the sale remained on schedule at the planned issue price, even as sources said bankers of the country’s largest secondary share sale were considering extending the timeline beyond Tuesday, or tweaking the price due to the fall in its share price. Indian regulations say the share offering must receive minimum subscription of 90%, and if it does not the issuer must refund the entire amount. Maybank Securities and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are among investors who bid for the anchor portion of the issue. Maybank said in a statement “there is no financial impact” on it as the subscription to Adani’s offer was fully funded by client funds. State-run insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) told Reuters on Monday it was reviewing the Adani Group’s response to Hindenburg’s report and would hold talks with the management within days. LIC took 5% of the $734-million anchor portion. It already holds a 4.23% stake in the flagship Adani firm, while its other exposures include a 9.14% stake in Adani Ports and 5.96% in Adani Total Gas. “Since we are a large investor we have the right to ask relevant questions,” LIC managing director Raj Kumar said. US dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone continued their fall into a second week with the bond maturing in August 2027 down 5 cents to 73.03 cents, the lowest since June 2020. Other dollar denominated bonds of the group were also trading lower. Index provider MSCI has said it was seeking feedback from market participants on Adani and was monitoring the factors that “may impact the eligibility of those relevant securities” in MSCI indexes. In its response on Sunday, Adani highlighted its relationships with local and international banks and its access to diverse funding sources and structures, listing US banks Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as well as other lenders including BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Standard Chartered. The stock market meltdown is a dramatic setback for 60-year-old Adani. The school dropout’s stunning rise came with over 1,500% gains in some of his group stocks over three years, making him the world’s third richest man before he slipped to rank eighth on the Forbes list on Monday. Responding to Adani’s rebuttal, Hindenburg said the company’s “response largely confirmed our findings and ignored our key questions.” Hindenburg in its report said Adani companies had “substantial debt” and that shares in seven Adani listed companies have an 85% downside due to what it called “sky-high valuations.” Adani’s response stated that over the past decade, its group companies have “consistently de-levered.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/blinken-reaffirms-need-for-two-state-solution/,[],"TEL AVIV, Israel – US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Palestinians to calm tensions as he visited on Monday, January 30, during the worst violence in years, reaffirming a long-stalled peace vision as the “only path” forward. While focusing censure on a Palestinian gun spree outside a synagogue that has put Israel on high alert, Blinken also cautioned against any celebration or avenging of such bloodshed. Seven people were shot dead in Friday’s attack by an East Jerusalem man who was himself killed by police. Lionized by many fellow Palestinians, he had no known links to militant groups. A day earlier, Israel carried out an unusually deep raid on Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing 10 residents, most of them gunmen. At least 35 Palestinians, including fighters and civilians, have died in violence surging since January 1, medical officials say. “It is the responsibility of everyone to take steps to calm tensions rather than inflame them,” Blinken told reporters after landing in Tel Aviv. Friday’s rampage, he said, “was more than attack on individuals. It was also an attack on the universal act of practising one’s faith. We condemn it in the strongest terms. “And we condemn all those who celebrate these and any other acts of terrorism that take innocent lives, no matter who the victim is or what they believe. Calls for vengeance against more innocent victims are not the answer.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Blinken will meet later on Monday, has called for more citizens to carry guns as a precaution against such street attacks. But he has also warned Israelis not to resort to vigilante violence. Blinken is due to see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday. Palestinian officials said Israeli settlers had set fire on Monday to two cars near the northern West Bank city of Nablus and thrown stones at a house near Ramallah, following a similar attack on Sunday. Elsewhere in the West Bank, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops killed a 26-year-old man at a checkpoint. The army said troops opened fire on the man’s car after he rammed into one of them and attempted to flee an inspection. The last round of US-sponsored talks on founding a Palestinian state alongside Israel stalled in 2014. Netanyahu’s new hardline government includes partners who oppose Palestinian statehood, and control over the Palestinian territories is divided between Abbas, who favors diplomacy, and rival Hamas Islamists, who are sworn to Israel’s destruction. Washington remains “a stalwart believer in the negotiated two-state solution – the only path to a lasting resolution for the conflict,” Blinken said in earlier remarks in Cairo. Recent data, though, indicates that public support for a two-state solution has reached a historic low. According a survey published last week by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Research, just 33% of Palestinians and 34% of Israeli Jews say they support it, marking a significant drop from data collected in 2020. Two-thirds of Palestinians and 53% of Israeli Jews said they were opposed to the two-state solution. The United States has voiced support for Israel’s security and for Palestinians to enjoy equal measures of dignity. – Rappler.com"

Bulanadi provided spark off the bench and chalked up 16 points in 18 minutes to help San Miguel cruise to a 124-93 blowout win over Phoenix in its PBA Governors’ Cup opener on Sunday, January 29. The former San Sebastian standout dropped 13 points in the first half of the romp that saw the Beermen lead by as many as 33 points. “It was my first game for San Miguel so I was excited,” Bulanadi said in Filipino. “But I’m not content, I still want to have a better performance next game.” Bulanadi played his first three conferences with Alaska/Converge before the FiberXers shipped him to NorthPort through a one-for-one deal for Jerrick Balanza prior to the conference. His Batang Pier stint proved short-lived as they eventually sent him to the Beermen. The lefty gunner admitted being caught by surprise of the trade, considering he was seen as a franchise cornerstone at Converge after the Aces picked him fourth in the special Gilas Pilipinas round of the 2019 PBA Draft. The FiberXers went on to acquire the Alaska franchise as the Aces retired from the PBA. “I did not expect that,” said Bulanadi. “But I needed to accept it.

https://www.rappler.com/business/unilever-names-hein-schumacher-chief-executive-officer/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Unilever on Monday, January 30, appointed Hein Schumacher to replace Alan Jope as chief executive from July in a move that was welcomed by investors including board member and activist shareholder Nelson Peltz. Schumacher, 51, rejoined Unilever in October last year as non-executive director and is currently the chief of Dutch dairy business FrieslandCampina. He worked at Unilever more than 20 years ago before working for retailer Royal Ahold NV and packaged food maker HJ Heinz in the United States, Europe, and Asia. One of the biggest consumer companies in the world with more than 400 brands ranging from detergent to ice cream, Unilever said in September that Jope planned to retire at the end of 2023. Billionaire activist investor Peltz, who heads investor Trian Partners, said he strongly supports Schumacher “as our new CEO and look(s) forward to working closely with him to drive significant sustainable stakeholder value.” Peltz become a Unilever board member in July after it was revealed early last year that he had built a stake in the company. “I first met Hein when I served as a director at the HJ Heinz Company from 2006 to 2013 and was impressed by his leadership skills and business acumen,” Peltz said. Peltz, through his Trian Fund, holds a nearly 1.5% stake in Unilever, making him the fourth largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Unilever shares were up 0.56% versus a FTSE 100 index down 0.1% as of 1032 GMT. The move was also cheered by other investors and analysts, who have felt in recent years that Unilever needed an outsider’s touch. “Positive that he’s an external appointment,” Jack Martin, a fund manager at Unilever shareholder Oberon Investments, said. “Good CV from what I read, hopefully provides the impetus the company requires.” Unilever’s shares have underperformed European consumer staples and discretionary indices during CEO Jope’s tenure, which began in January 2019. His failed bids for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare business last year lost him some good faith among investors, including influential British billionaire Terry Smith, owner of Fundsmith. Smith said at the time that Jope needed to focus less on sustainability and more on building Unilever’s core business. “Hein is ideal for Unilever – he’s got roots at the company but at the same time he’s external,” Allan Leighton, former CEO of British food retailer Asda and ex-chair of Britain’s Royal Mail, told Reuters. Leighton, who worked with Schumacher on the board of C&A AG, described him as “ESG savvy but in a pragmatic and commercial way.” Tineke Frikee, a fund manager at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management, said: “It is good Schumacher has plenty of industry experience outside Unilever, particularly international.” “I note though that his background is mainly in food, rather than beauty and personal care. This may lead the market to reduce the probability of a potential food spin-off.” Unilever’s food business includes Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Colman’s mustard, Hellman’s mayonnaise, and Knorr stock cubes. Some investors and analysts have speculated over the past year that Unilever might spin off what they feel is a weaker food business to focus on personal goods, beauty, and home care. “Why hire a food exec, if you are planning to sell the food business?” Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said, adding that selling the food business “will always be on the cards, but I doubt that it is top priority in the short term.” But Monteyne pointed out that some investors were hoping Unilever would name someone more well-established, globally. “Investors we spoke to in recent weeks were hopeful for a more familiar name from a successful US-based FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) turnaround.” Unilever had been considering internal and external candidates for the role. Sources told Reuters in October that the candidates included finance chief Graeme Pitkethly, personal care division boss Fabian Garcia, and Hanneke Faber, who heads the company’s nutrition group. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/boeing-747-original-jumbo-jet-prepares-final-send-off/,[],"Boeing‘s 747, the original and arguably most aesthetic “Jumbo Jet,” revolutionized air travel only to see its more than five-decade reign as “Queen of the Skies” ended by more efficient twinjet planes. The last commercial Boeing jumbo will be delivered to Atlas Air in the surviving freighter version on Tuesday, January 31, 53 years after the 747’s instantly recognizable humped silhouette grabbed global attention as a Pan Am passenger jet. “On the ground it’s stately, it’s imposing,” said Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer of Iron Maiden who piloted a specially liveried 747 nicknamed “Ed Force One” during the British heavy metal band’s tour in 2016. “And in the air it’s surprisingly agile. For this massive airplane, you can really chuck it around if you have to.” Designed in the late 1960s to meet demand for mass travel, the world’s first twin-aisle wide body jetliner’s nose and upper deck became the world’s most luxurious club above the clouds. But it was in the seemingly endless rows at the back of the new jumbo that the 747 transformed travel. “This was the airplane that introduced flying for the middle class in the US,” said Air France-KLM chief executive officer Ben Smith. “Prior to the 747 your average family couldn’t fly from the US to Europe affordably,” Smith told Reuters. The jumbo also made its mark on global affairs, symbolizing war and peace, from America’s “Doomsday Plane” nuclear command post to papal visits on chartered 747s nicknamed Shepherd One. Now, two previously delivered 747s are being fitted to replace US presidential jets known globally as Air Force One. As a Pan Am flight attendant, Linda Freier served passengers ranging from Michael Jackson to Mother Teresa. “It was an incredible diversity of passengers. People who were well dressed and people who had very little and spent everything they had on that ticket,” Freier said. When the first 747 took off from New York on January 22, 1970, after a delay due to an engine glitch, it more than doubled plane capacity to 350 to 400 seats, in turn reshaping airport design. “It was the aircraft for the people, the one that really delivered the capability to be a mass market,” aviation historian Max Kingsley-Jones said. “It was transformational across all aspects of the industry,” the senior consultant at Ascend by Cirium added. Its birth become the stuff of aviation myth. Pan Am founder Juan Trippe sought to cut costs by increasing the number of seats. On a fishing trip, he challenged Boeing president William Allen to make something dwarfing the 707. Allen put legendary engineer Joe Sutter in charge. It took only 28 months for Sutter’s team known as “the Incredibles” to develop the 747 before the first flight on February 9, 1969. Although it eventually became a cash cow, the 747’s initial years were riddled with problems and the $1-billion development costs almost bankrupted Boeing, which believed the future of air travel lay in supersonic jets. After a slump during the 1970s oil crisis, the plane’s heyday arrived in 1989 when Boeing introduced the 747-400 with new engines and lighter materials, making it a perfect fit to meet growing demand for trans-Pacific flights. “The 747 is the most beautiful and easy plane to land…. It’s just like landing an armchair,” said Dickinson, who also chairs aviation maintenance firm Caerdav. The same swell of innovation that got the 747 off the ground has spelled its end, as advances made it possible for dual-engine jets to replicate its range and capacity at lower cost. Yet the 777X, set to take the 747’s place at the top of the jet market, will not be ready until at least 2025 after delays. “In terms of impressive technology, great capacity, great economics…[the 777X] does sadly make the 747 look obsolete,” AeroDynamic Advisory managing director Richard Aboulafia said. Nevertheless, the latest 747-8 version is set to grace the skies for years, chiefly as a freighter, having outlasted European Airbus’ double-decker A380 passenger jet in production. This week’s final 747 delivery leaves questions over the future of the mammoth but now underused Everett widebody production plant outside Seattle, while Boeing is also struggling after the COVID pandemic and a 737 MAX safety crisis. Chief executive Dave Calhoun has said Boeing may not design a new airliner for at least a decade. “It was one of the wonders of the modern industrial age,” said Aboulafia, “But this isn’t an age of wonders, it’s an age of economics.” – Rappler.com"

At Mega Q-Mart in Quezon City, frozen eggs are sold for P55 per kilo, just one-fifth of the cost of a tray of eggs, which can go for over P250. Gregorio San Diego, chairman of the Philippine Egg Board Association, explained that frozen eggs have long been sold in markets, but these are meant for bakeries making leche flan and pastries. “This is the first time that I’m hearing that frozen eggs are sold for retail consumers. Perhaps it’s because of the high prices of egg,” San Diego told Rappler in a text message. Latest figures from the Department of Agriculture’s price monitoring showed that on average, a medium egg costs between P8 and P9, a 45% increase from a year ago. San Diego said frozen eggs are safe, as long as they are stored properly. Bakeries and other industrial users are well aware of the proper handling procedures. But for ordinary consumers who are just starting to buy frozen eggs, the Department of Health (DOH) has issued an advisory. “Frozen eggs can be a source of contamination and eventually cause food poisoning since raw foods are suitable for the growth of Salmonella bacterium and Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli). These bacteria are known to cause infection, diarrhea (which can be severe and bloody), stomach pains, fever, nausea, and vomiting,” the DOH said. For regular eggs, here’s how to check if they are safe to eat: Finally, make sure to thoroughly cook eggs before serving. The egg industry is facing an inflation problem, as consumption outpaces production, and several outbreaks of avian flu wipe out hen populations.

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/britain-boris-johnson-says-putin-threatened-him-with-missile-strike/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened him with a missile strike during a phone call in the run up to the invasion of Ukraine, a charge denied by Moscow. Johnson, speaking to the BBC for a documentary, said the Russian leader had asked him about the prospects of Ukraine joining NATO, to which he had responded it would not be “for the foreseeable future”. “He threatened me at one point, and he said, ‘Boris, I don’t want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute’ or something like that. Jolly,” Johnson said, recalling the “very long” and “most extraordinary” call in February 2022 which followed a visit by the then prime minister to Kyiv. “But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters what Johnson had said was not true, or “more precisely, a lie”. Relations between Moscow and London had sunk to their lowest level in decades even before Russia invaded Ukraine, on the back of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the British city of Salisbury in 2018. Johnson, who stepped down in September in the wake of a series of scandals, sought to position London as Kyiv’s top ally in the West. While in office he visited Kyiv several times and called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy frequently. He also visited again this month. – Rappler.com"

The pandemic was likely in a “transition point” that continues to need careful management to “mitigate the potential negative consequences”, the agency added in a statement. It is three years since the WHO first declared that COVID represented a global health emergency. More than 6.8 million people have died during the outbreak, which has touched every country on Earth, ravaging communities and economies. However, the advent of vaccines and treatments has changed the pandemic situation considerably since 2020, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he hopes to see an end to the emergency this year, particularly if access to the counter-measures can be improved globally. “We remain hopeful that in the coming year, the world will transition to a new phase in which we reduce (COVID) hospitalizations and deaths to their lowest possible level,” Tedros told a separate WHO meeting on Monday. Advisers to the WHO expert committee on the pandemic’s status told Reuters in December that it was likely not the moment to end the emergency given the uncertainty over the wave of infections in China after it lifted its strict zero-COVID measures at the end of 2022. – Rappler.com"

A foul was not called, however. “There was contact,” crew chief Eric Lewis said to a pool reporter after the game. “At the time, during the game, we did not see a foul.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/magsino-laments-crowded-government-shelters-overseas-filipinos/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – A party-list lawmaker representing overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the House of Representatives called on the government to ensure a safe, humane, and habitable shelter for migrants in distress. In a privilege speech, OFW Representative Marissa “del Mar” Magsino cited a Bahay Kalinga in Kuwait, which the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) discovered was housing 421 documented and undocumented Filipinos, more than double the shelter’s capacity of around 200 people. “Per DMW, we have 24 MWO (migrant workers’ office) shelters worldwide, 14 of which are in the Middle East. The shelters in Middle East often burst at the seams with hundreds of distressed OFWs seeking a temporary sanctuary, forcing it to accommodate much more than its capacity,” she said in the House plenary on Monday, January 30. “A shelter is not a home; it is a mere place of refuge, a sanctuary. But we can make it a home for our OFWs who seek a haven in times of distress while on foreign soil, even just for the interim, if we provide the necessary amenities and environment to make them feel at home and ease their pain,” she added. Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople sent a high-level team to Kuwait on January 14 after she saw via a virtual inspection the living conditions of Bahay Kalinga occupants there. Ople later ordered her team to look for alternative buildings that could house the OFWs, and started discussions on how the DMW could upgrade facilities at government-run shelters. Nearly 200 OFWs from that shelter in Kuwait have returned to the Philippines. Magsino called on the government to “untangle the knots” in the current repatriation system, pointing out that funds are handled currently by three agencies: the DMW, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. “Having the funds separately administered by various agencies, coupled with the fact that the DMW is still in transition to fully establishing its operations, raise concerns on the effective utilization of repatriation funds and on the clear delineation of the target beneficiaries in accordance with governing laws,” she said. “One thing is certain and imperative: it should not affect or compromise the immediate repatriation of our distressed OFWs, which would help decongest our shelters, especially in the Middle East,” Magsino added. Thousands of cases of OFW maltreatment have been recorded worldwide through the years, a bulk of which took place in countries in the Middle East. The latest high-profile case was the death of 35-year-old Jullebee Ranara, a Filipino domestic worker whose burned remains were found in a Kuwaiti desert. The suspect is the 17-year-old son of the victim’s employer. Turning emotional, Magsino said: “This is not just a case to add to the statistics; this is a life of our kababayan mercilessly taken from her loved ones.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-sss-gsis-philhealth-pagibig-salary-monthly-deductions/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – We’ve all been there – looking forward to a big pay-day only to find that salary deductions have eaten up your take-home pay. With high inflation already threatening your money’s worth and news of rate hikes to SSS and PhilHealth monthly contributions, you might be wondering: just what are these deductions for anyway, and what’s in it for you? Let’s look at the purpose and benefits of each, as well as how to compute monthly contributions. Under Philippine labor laws, all employees are required to become members of the Social Security System (SSS), Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG). Government employees, on the other hand, become a part of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) rather than SSS. The SSS exists primarily to give social security benefits, covering sickness, maternity, disability, old age, and death. Qualified members can also avail of salary, housing, business, and educational loans. Persons belonging to the private sector, household helps, employees of foreign governments based in the Philippines, public utility drivers and operators, self-employed persons, farmers, fishermen, workers in the informal sector, and overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are all required to become members. Voluntary members include the non-working spouse of an SSS member and members who are separated from employment. Find more details about the SSS and its member benefits here. Similar to the SSS, the GSIS provides social security benefits for government workers. Among these are life insurance, retirement, separation, and employee’s compensation benefits. Members can also avail of multi-purpose loans, policy loans, enhanced emergency loans, enhanced pension loans, and pensioners emergency loans. Membership covers all government workers except certain members of the judiciary and constitutional commissions, contractual employees, and uniformed members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). Find more details about GSIS benefits here and GSIS loans here. PhilHealth is mandated to provide universal health insurance coverage and healthcare services for all citizens of the Philippines. PhilHealth members receive financial assistance for medicine, hospital costs, and certain inpatient and outpatient procedures. Members are classified as either direct or indirect contributors. Direct contributors are persons with the capacity to pay premiums, such as employees, self-employed individuals, and OFWs. Indirect contributors are all others who are not classified as direct contributors, such as indigents, senior citizens, and persons with disability; their contributions are subsidized by the national government. Find more details about PhilHealth benefits here. The Pag-IBIG Fund provides a national savings and housing assistance program for all members. Qualified members can avail of housing loans, multi-purpose loans, and calamity loans. Besides its regular savings program, members can also participate in the Modified Pag-IBIG 2 special savings facility for higher dividends. Membership in Pag-IBIG is mandatory for all persons who are covered by SSS or GSIS, as well as uniformed members of the AFP, PNP, BJMP, and BFP. Voluntary membership in Pag-IBIG is also welcomed. Find more details about Pag-IBIG membership and benefits here. Membership to each of these allows employees to enjoy government-mandated benefits. However, to avail of their full benefits, members must pay contributions regularly and actively. Here’s how the employee share of these government monthly contributions are computed: For SSS, the amount deducted is computed as a percentage of your monthly salary credit. The monthly salary credit is a figure that SSS assigns depending on the salary bracket you fall under. However, for convenience, SSS has already computed the required contributions for all salary brackets. Refer to this SSS circular or the SSS contribution table below to find your required contribution. First, check the “range of compensation” column to find where your monthly salary falls under. To find the employee’s share to be deducted from your salary, check the column marked “EE.” Keep in mind that an SSS rate hike has taken effect starting this January 2023, raising the total monthly contribution to 14%. Similar to SSS, GSIS collects premium contributions from both the government employee and the government agency or employer to which he or she belongs. The employee share of the contribution is 9% of his or her actual monthly salary. The current PhilHealth premium rate is 4% of your monthly basic salary. The monthly premium can range between P400 to P3,200 depending on your salary. There is also an income floor and ceiling for the premium computation. For those earning 10,000 and below, the monthly premium is set at P400. Those earning P80,000 and above have their monthly premiums capped at P3,200. Once you compute your monthly premium, the amount is then divided equally between you and your employer. Note that a scheduled rate hike to the PhilHealth premium rate was set to take effect in 2023, which would have bumped it up to 4.5%. However, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ordered PhilHealth to suspend its increase, citing “prevailing socioeconomic challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.” (READ: Romualdez wants to give president power to suspend PhilHealth rate hike) For those with a monthly basic salary of P1,500 and below, the contribution rate is 1%. Those earning above P1,500 have a 2% contribution rate. The maximum Pag-IBIG contribution is capped at P100 per month once members have a monthly salary above P5,000. – Rappler.com"

Most countries’ leaders avoid high-level public interactions with Taiwan and its president, not wishing to provoke China, the world’s second largest economy. In 2016, US President-elect Donald Trump spoke by telephone with Tsai shortly after winning the election, setting off a storm of protest from Beijing. Pavel’s spokeswoman said he and Tsai were expected to speak at 1000 GMT. Taiwan’s presidential office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said on Sunday that Tsai had offered her congratulations to Pavel on his victory. Pavel, a former army chief and high NATO official who won the Czech presidential election on Saturday, will take office in early March when he will replace current head of state Milos Zeman, who has been known for his pro-Beijing stance. The Czech Republic, like most countries, has no official diplomatic relations with Chinese claimed Taiwan, but the two sides have moved closer together as Taipei seeks new friends in Eastern and Central Europe. Pavel has strongly backed Western support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Taipei has sought to bolster its relations with European countries by stressing their shared values of freedom and democracy, especially as Beijing ratchets up military threats to try and force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. In 2020, the head of the Czech Senate visited Taiwan and declared himself to be Taiwanese in a speech at Taiwan’s parliament, channelling the late US President John F. Kennedy’s defiance of communism in Berlin in 1963. – Rappler.com"

The Philippine Army, the Department of National Defense, the Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, Radio Television Malacañang – RTVM, and the Philippine Information Agency have not posted anything that confirms the deployment of Philippine Army troops in Ukraine. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has also not made any announcements on his official social media pages that he sent Philippine troops to Ukraine. There are also no reports from official media sources that confirm the claim. Neutral stance remains: Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Philippines has remained neutral in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. According to a Philippine News Agency (PNA) report published on June 10, 2022, Clarita Carlos, then the national security adviser, said that the Marcos administration will maintain the country’s neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. As of writing, there have been no new statements from any government officials announcing any changes in the Philippines’ stance in the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/novak-djokovic-greatest-of-all-time-debate-move-french-open-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – A triumphant Novak Djokovic paraded the Australian Open trophy around the gardens of Melbourne’s Government House on Monday, January 30, his 10th title having added another notch in the plus column for those who argue he is the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT). That debate may never be settled but if it is to be decided purely in terms of major championship success, it now moves on to the French Open in the European spring with the Serbian and Rafael Nadal tied on 22 titles. While the blue courts of Melbourne Park are undoubtedly Djokovic’s domain, the red clay courts of Roland Garros are the preserve of Spaniard Nadal, the other open-era GOAT contender along with 20-times Grand Slam champion Roger Federer. Federer is now retired and sent his congratulations to Djokovic on Instagram – “Incredible effort, again!” – but Nadal was back in Spain being treated for the latest in a series of injuries that have blighted his career. The 36-year-old is confident he will recover from the hip flexor issue he sustained at the Australian Open in time to drag his battered body to Paris in May in a bid for a 15th French Open title. And, despite a hamstring issue that hindered him throughout the year’s first Grand Slam, Djokovic left little doubt that he would also be there trying to win major No. 23. “I think there’s still a lot of that fire inside of me that is burning of passion for the sport and for competition and I think that’s what allows me to still push myself to the limit,” he said on Monday. “In the practice sessions, day in, day out after so many years to go through the same routines, repetitively, that sometimes is not so interesting.” “But I know that there is always a greater goal and a guiding star, so to say, and this trophy is one of those guiding stars, it’s something that I always strive to achieve.” While the resilience shown by Djokovic and Nadal means men’s tennis can continue to enjoy the back end of the most glittering of golden eras, women’s tennis continues with its first season trying to fill the void left by Serena Williams. The American, when fit, dominated the women’s game for the best part of two decades while hoovering up 23 Grand Slam singles titles – a tally only bettered by Australian Margaret Court (24) mostly in the amateur era. Even if Djokovic’s opposition to COVID-19 vaccines keeps him out of the US Open for a second year running, Sunday’s title put him firmly in touching distance of those tallies. “I really don’t want to stop here,” he said after the final. “I don’t have any intention of stopping here. I feel great about my tennis. I know that when I’m feeling good physically, mentally present, I have a chance to win any slam against anybody. “I like my chances going forward.” – Rappler.com"

According to the council, which can enact the draconian anti-terror law, the community doctor was involved in the planning, training, preparing, and facilitating “the commission of terrorism and recruitment” in support to alleged terrorist organizations. Castro, who helped in setting up community health centers in Mindanao, was arrested last year in their home in San Juan City. She is among the many respondents of kidnapping and serious illegal detention charges filed in Agusan del Sur. Her family had already denied the allegations against her. Even before her arrest, Castro had been red-tagged for her human rights advocacy. Aside from providing health services for the less fortunate, she also served as the secretary general of rights group Karapatan in Caraga region. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, ATC’s chairperson, signed the resolution, along with National Intelligence Coordinating Agency Director General Ricardo de Leon. Former National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos, who was ATC’s vice chairperson at that time, has no signature affixed in the document. In its resolution, the ATC listed down three specific reasons why it tagged the community doctor a terrorist: However, aside from denying the government’s allegations, Castro was described by her family as a selfless person because she chose to serve the community. While completing her Alternative Residency Program with the Community Medicine Development Foundation, Castro worked as a physician at the CBHP. The group is a consortium of health programs from nongovernmental organizations primarily serving the rural and urban poor areas in the country. Aside from attending to people’s medical needs, Castro also worked as a human rights worker – she served as a human rights documenter for Karapatan. In 20 years, Castro was also able to build 50 peoples’ organizations and trained thousands of health care workers. With this, she was able to multiply the health force attending to medical needs of the communities. At one point, Dr. Castro also brought a Lumad representative to the United Nations to help them in their fight against threats and harassment. – Rappler.com"

MH-60 Seahawk helicopters and F/A-18 Hornet jets bearing pilot call signs like “Fozzie Bear”, “Pig Sweat” and “Bongoo” emit deafening screams as they land in the drizzle on the Nimitz, which is leading a carrier strike group that entered the South China Sea two weeks ago. The group’s commander, Rear Admiral Christopher Sweeney, said the tour was part of a US commitment to uphold freedom of passage in the waters and airspace of a region vital to global trade. “We are going to sail, fly and operate wherever international norms and rules allow. We’re going to do that safely and we’re going to be resolute about that,” Sweeney told Reuters on Friday. “It’s really just about sailing and operating obviously with our allies and partners in the area and assuring them of free and open commerce and trade in the Indo-Pacific.” A US presence in the South China Sea, a conduit for about $3.4 trillion of annual trade, has been welcomed by allies like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, but it continues to rile rival China, which sees the exercises as provocations in its backyard. China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entire South China Sea, which includes the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. Beijing has been conducting regular exercises too and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels far off its mainland – a source of frequent tension with its neighbors. The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group 11 includes the guided-missile cruiser Bunker Hill and the guided-missile destroyers Decatur, Wayne E. Meyer and Chung-Hoon. The Chung-Hoon on January 5 sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, irking China. That came two weeks after a Chinese navy J-11 fighter jet caused alarm when it came within 10 feet (3 metres) of a US Air Force plane over the South China Sea. Sweeney said it was crucial for international rules to be followed and said the US presence in the South China Sea demonstrated its commitment to its regional allies. “We’ve operated in the same body of water as the Chinese or the Singaporean navy or the Filipino navy since we’ve arrived and it’s all been safe and professional,” he said. “We’re going to sail, fly and operate wherever international waters allow us to, so we’re not going anywhere.” – Rappler.com"

No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. The Belo Medical Group has proven its mettle as one of the most respected experts in the field of aesthetic science in the Philippines with two co-authored papers recently presented at the renowned International Master Course on Aging Science (IMCAS) World Congress 2023, featuring the best in dermatology, plastic surgery, and anti aging science, held at the Palais des Congres in Paris, France last January 26. It is in the company’s DNA to provide extensive studies in local and international congresses to prove that it is a world-class hub for safe and trusted aesthetic medicine in Asia and in the world – showing Filipino aesthetic physicians are brilliant in what they do. “Part of [what we do] is to always give talks abroad, because I want us to be recognized as the experts on Asian skin,” said Dr. Vicki Belo. “You learn more when you’re having conversations [with other experts]. Medicine is mentorship. Medicine is ‘see one, do one, teach one,” Helmed by Dr. Vicki Belo as the principal author, the papers are co-authored by Dr. Princess Czaronne T. Odita and Dr. Guada Santos-Capiz, two of the top doctors from the Belo Medical Group. In front of a full house crowd at this year’s IMCAS in Paris, the papers discussed two key treatments specialized by the Belo Medical Group. The first presentation, called “A Pilot Study: Combining Fractional Carbon dioxide Laser and PDO Threads in Treating Skin Laxity and Brow Ptosis in Asian Patients,” zeroes in on an in-demand treatment that achieves the coveted eye lift effect, without surgery. Meanwhile, the presentation on “Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty Using Polydioxanone Threads in Asian Patients” is a study on the uber-popular HIKO threads – a minimally-invasive Korean treatment that ticks the boxes of patients wanting a more slender, filter-like nose without the hassle and commitment of surgical rhinoplasty. In the world of aesthetics, trends build desire, and desire creates demand – the Belo Medical Group saw the increasing clamor for non-commital and less invasive nose procedures that still achieve their patients’ desired width and shape. It’s this intuitive bond with their clients that steered the team of doctors to focus on the HIKO procedure as a subject. Belo Medical Group, headed by Dr. Vicki Belo for 32 years, has been presenting all around the world consistently to provide back-up studies for aesthetic treatments and to contribute further knowledge to the world about how to treat Asian skin. Along with Dr. Belo, Dr. Cess won the Best Energy-Based Treatment Award at the 2022 Aesthetic & Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress 2022 (AMWC) in Monaco. It was celebrated for its innovative use of the Vivace® radiofrequency micro-needling technology in combination with air dissection. In 2021, Dr. Vicki Belo and the Belo Medical Group gained recognition at the Global Health & Pharma’s Healthcare & Pharmaceutical (GHP) Awards and was bestowed the “Beauty Industry Pioneer of the Year Award.” To add, Dr. Joey Muñoz and Dr. Villanueva also had the opportunity to present two studies at the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery’s (ASLMS) Annual Conference in Denver, USA back in 2019. *Dr. Vicki Belo is also member of the following organizations: American Society of Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS), American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery (AACS), American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS), American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M), International Society of Cosmetic Laser Surgeons (ISCLS), International Society of Dermatologic Surgery (ISDS), and Philippine Society of Liposuction Surgery. – Rappler.com"

On January 27, the ICC authorized the resumption of its probe into the killings under former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war. “We will not allow any of our officials to be investigated or tried by the International Criminal Court. I’m telling you as lawyer of the president, I will not allow, as far as I’m concerned, I will not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,” added the nonagenarian, who is also among the appointed lawyers closest to Marcos in Malacañang. It’s the same argument the justice department has made in insisting that there is no need for the ICC to investigate the alleged crimes committed in the name of Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs. Justice department spokesperson Mico Clavano, in a separate media conference, said the Philippines has a “working justice system” that continues to investigate the war on drugs. “Kaya naman natin iprotekta yung sovereignty natin but at the same time investigate talaga at kung maaari i-convict yung mga nagkasala dito sa war on drugs (We can both protect our sovereignty but at the same time investigate and if possible, convict those who violated laws in the war on drugs),” he added. The Philippine National Police (PNP), the agency that primarily implemented the drug war, has also stuck to the same argument. “The Philippines has a robust, efficient, and functioning criminal justice system with active legal proceedings and remedies available to address any claim of human rights abuses in the government’s anti-illegal drug campaign. This is evidenced by ongoing investigations on all drug-related deaths and cases of successful prosecution of some government personnel involved in related crimes,” said PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. in a separate news briefing on January 30. The arguments of officials under the Marcos administration – from the justice department to the police – have been the same as those made under the previous Duterte administration. Marcos is an ally of the former president, and although the President did not get his predecessor’s explicit endorsements, he ran for president alongside Duterte’s daughter Sara. The ICC found in its “careful analysis of the materials provided by the Philippines” that it was “not satisfied” by investigations ongoing in the country. It believes the Philippines is not capable of investigating and bringing to justice officials responsible for drug-war deaths under Duterte – from his time as Davao City mayor to his presidency from 2016 to 2022. Thus far, only a handful of cops have been convicted of crimes linked to the drug war. Marcos himself has yet to speak on the ICC’s latest decision, instead opting to communicate via the justice department. Enrile was part of an initial meeting with then executive secretary Vic Rodriguez, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla, Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, and former president Rodrigo Duterte’s palace spokesperson Harry Roque in July 2022. Roque, who waged an unsuccessful bid for the Senate under the Marcos-Duterte slate, was “private counsel to [Marcos]” in the meeting. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/philadelphia-eagles-await-andy-reid-patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-2023/,[],"Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs return to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, and the Philadelphia Eagles will be there waiting. The Chiefs beat the Cincinnati Bengals to claim the AFC Championship and set up a showdown in Arizona in Super Bowl LVII on February 12 with the Eagles, who fired Reid in 2012 after 14 seasons with the franchise. “Here we come, Philly,” Reid said in the postgame ceremony while receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy. The Eagles’ all-time winningest coach, Reid also appeared in five conference championship games during his run with Philadelphia, but went to the Super Bowl just once, losing to the New England Patriots in the 2004 season. The Chiefs gritted out a win Sunday, January 29 (Monday, January 30, Manila time), closing out the 23-20 win on a Harrison Butker field goal from 45 yards out with three seconds to play. Now in his 10th season with the Chiefs, Reid leaned on defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo for a big assist on Sunday. Bengals quarterback Burrow was intercepted twice and sacked five times. Defensive tackle Chris Jones sacked Burrow twice, including on Cincinnati’s final drive to force a punt in the final minute of the game. “I didn’t make the plays I needed to. They did a good job of creating one-on-one matchups up front to let their guys go,” Burrow said. “We just weren’t able to convert those last couple plays.” The Bengals lost for the first time in 11 games and were seeking back-to-back Super Bowl appearances after losing to the Los Angeles Rams last February. “The great thing about the NFL is that it’s not just four years. You have years ahead of you where you can try to win again,” Burrow said. Four years has been a near-constant victory parade for the Chiefs. Kansas City has 52 regular-season wins since the start of the 2019 season and six days before the AFC title game was played, the Chiefs were viewed as the underdog due to Mahomes’ right ankle injury. Also, Cincinnati cornerback Mike Hilton referenced Kansas City’s home venue as “Burrowhead.” “There was a lot of talking going on this week,” Jones said. “Let me tell y’all something man, don’t ever, ever disrespect Arrowhead Stadium, no matter how many times you beat us.” Mahomes, the second quarterback to reach three Super Bowls in his first six seasons, lost three receivers to injury before halftime – Mecole Hardman (pelvis), Kadarius Toney (ankle) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (knee). While his offensive line bought time, the running game was nonexistent for the Chiefs (20 carries, 42 yards) and tight end Travis Kelce played with a back injury. Marquez Valdes-Scantling caught six passes for 116 yards and a touchdown for Kansas City and Kelce caught a TD. He’ll see his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, in the season-ender in two weeks. “I told the guys before the game, it’s going to take everybody,” Mahomes said. Mahomes said his ankle wasn’t a major factor on Sunday. The Eagles will test his mobility. The Eagles had a season-best 78 sacks including the playoffs, which rates behind only the 1984 and 1985 Bears (82 and 80, respectively) as the third-highest all-time. – Rappler.com"

Four people lost their lives in flash floods and landslides that hit Auckland over the last three days amid record downpours. A state of emergency remains in place in Auckland. A state of emergency in the Waitomo region south of Auckland was lifted. Flights in and out of Auckland Airport are still experiencing delays and cancellations, with thousands of passengers still stranded, including hundreds from overseas, flag carrier Air New Zealand said on Monday. Beaches around the city of 1.6 million are closed and all Auckland schools will remain closed until February 7. “There has been very significant damage across Auckland,” New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins told state-owned television station TVNZ on Monday. “Obviously there were a number of homes damaged by flooding but also extensive earth movements.” Around 350 people were in need of emergency accommodation, he added. The country’s Metservice is forecasting further heavy rains to hit the already sodden city late on Tuesday. “We have more adverse weather coming and we need to prepare for that,” Auckland Emergency Management duty controller Rachel Kelleher told a media conference. Fire and Emergency services received 30 callouts overnight Monday, including responding to a landslide when a carport slid down a hill. The council has designated 69 houses as uninhabitable and has prevented people from entering them. A further 300 properties were deemed at risk, with access restricted to certain areas for short periods. The north of New Zealand’s North Island is receiving more rain than normal due to the La Nina weather event. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said Auckland has already recorded more than eight times its average January rainfall and 40% of its annual average rainfall. The cost of the clean up is expected to top the NZ$97 million ($63 million) bill for flooding on the West Coast in 2021 but will not be anywhere near as expensive as the estimated NZ$31 billion insured costs of two major earthquakes in Christchurch in 2010-2011, said Insurance Council of New Zealand spokesperson Christian Judge. Insurance Australia Group’s New Zealand divisions have received over 5,000 claims so far and Suncorp Group said it received around 3,000 claims across the Vero and AA Insurance Brands. New Zealand’s Tower said it had received around 1,900 claims. “The number of claims is expected to rise further over the coming days, with the event still unfolding and as customers identify damage to their property,” IAG said in a statement. Economists say the recovery and rebuild could add to inflationary pressures in New Zealand as vehicles and household goods need to be replaced and there is an increase in construction work needed to repair or rebuild houses and infrastructure damaged by the flooding. – Rappler.com"

Abarrientos flashed Franklin the middle finger after the former NBA player hit a clutch three-pointer with a minute left that paved the way for the FiberXers to clinch a 111-109 win. Franklin gestured towards the Hotshots bench to keep it down after the triple – an act that irked Abarrientos. League commissioner Willie Marcial said Abarrientos – a member of the 25 Greatest PBA Players – expressed his regret over his end-game antics. “He was very apologetic,” said Marcial in Filipino. “I told him not to do it again.” Franklin finished with 26 points, 13 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocks in the victory as Converge seized solo top spot with a perfect 3-0 record.

Song’s agency first confirmed in December 2022 that the actor is “currently seeing a woman with positive feelings.” At the time, additional details about the relationship have not been disclosed.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/world-health-organization-seeks-reinforced-role-key-meeting/,[],"GENEVA, Switzerland – The World Health Organization will push at its board meeting this week for an expanded role in tackling the next global health emergency after COVID-19, but is still seeking answers on how to fund it, according to health policy experts. The Geneva meeting sets the program for the UN agency this year – as well as its future budget – with the WHO facing two key challenges: a world that expects ever more from its leading health body, but which has not yet proven willing to fund it to tackle those challenges. At the Executive Board’s annual meeting from January 30-February 7, countries will give feedback on WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ global strategy to strengthen readiness for the next pandemic which includes a binding treaty currently being negotiated. “I think the focus is very much on the program budget, then sustainable financing,” Timothy Armstrong, WHO director for governing bodies, told journalists when asked about the agenda. Also on his list was “the position of the World Health Organization, recognizing there is a need for a reinforced central role for WHO” in the global health emergency system. The WHO is seeking a record $6.86 billion for the 2024-2025 budget, saying that approving this sum would be “a historic move towards a more empowered and independent WHO.” But approval will require member states to make good on promises made last year to hike mandatory fees – a fact which is uncertain since the deal was always subject to conditions. “What we are currently seeing is that some member states are now trying to pre-condition lots of things,” said a source close to the talks, saying it “remains to be seen” if all countries will commit to raising fees. Reuters could not immediately establish which countries might withhold support. The current base budget, which does not include the funding changes, has a nearly $1 billion financing hole, a WHO document showed – although that gap is not unusual at this point, two sources added. However, one did add that it was “absurd” that the WHO still has to scrabble for money after COVID-19. “It’s a huge knot,” said Nicoletta Dentico, the co-chair of the civil society platform the Geneval Global Health Hub. “The weakness of WHO is under our eyes.” The agency is also considering starting big replenishment rounds every few years to top up its coffers, a document showed. The WHO, which celebrates its 75-year anniversary having been set up in 1948, will also use the meeting to advocate for a boosted role in pandemic preparedness, documents showed. Tedros will call for a Global Health Emergency Council to be set up linked to WHO governance. However, external experts have said such a council needs higher-level political leadership. “Given that pandemic threats involve and impact almost every sector, it must be an outcome of a UN General Assembly resolution, be appointed by and accountable to it,” Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand and head of the independent panel set up to review the handling of COVID, told Reuters. – Rappler.com"

Ang katotohanan: Hindi pa rin nakalalaya si De Lima mula sa kanyang pagkakakulong magmula noong 2017. Sinabi ng kampo ni De Lima noong Enero 20 na tinitingnan nila ang posibilidad ng paghahain ng petisyon ng writ of habeas corpus katulad ng sa kaso ni Gigi Reyes. Si Reyes, dating chief of staff ng dating senador at ngayo’y Presidential Legal Counsel na si Juan Ponce Enrile, ay nasangkot sa pork barrel scam ng businesswoman na si Janet Napoles. Nabigyan ng pansamantalang kalayaan si Reyes matapos pumabor ang Korte Suprema sa kanyang petisyon. Nakitang paglabag sa kanyang karapatan sa isang mabilis na paglilitis ang pagkakapiit sa kanya sa mahabang panahon habang wala pa ring hatol ang korte hinggil sa kanyang mga kaso. Dahil dito, nalalabag din umano ang karapatan ni Reyes sa kalayaan. Taong 2014 pa nang nakulong si Reyes sa kasong graft at plunder. Inaabangan pa rin ng kampo ni De Lima ang resolusyon ng kanilang petisyon sa korte na naglalayong mapahintulutang makapagpiyansa ang dating senador sa kadahilanang kulang daw ang ebidensiya laban sa kanya. Inaasahang lumabas ang resolusyon ng petisyon bago matapos ang Marso. Wala namang naging pahayag ang Pangulo kaugnay sa kaso ni De Lima sa mga nagdaang linggo.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/army-milf-basketball-build-stronger-alliance-lanao-del-sur/,[],"LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines – As the sun beat down on the dusty roads of Lanao del Sur, an unlikely alliance took to the basketball court, on Sunday, January 29. Just minutes before the game, soldiers, their fatigues adorned with the insignia of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, stood alongside members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), some in their traditional garb as a testament to their distinct culture and identity. But on this day, with each bounce of the ball, they were united for a common goal: build trust, foster cooperation, and stand together against the scourge of radical extremism that threatens the Mindanao peace. The initiative, although not the first, came after years of armed conflict between the MILF and the government which resulted in mass displacements, trauma, and violence in the two Lanao provinces and other predominantly Muslim areas in Mindanao. “This significant event will solidify the brotherhood between the MILF and security sector,” said Bangsamoro parliament member and MILF-Northeastern Mindanao Front commander Basit Abbas, also known as Jannati Mimbantas. The game was organized and hosted by the Army’s 103rd Infantry Brigade with the help of groups such as the United States Institute of Peace-Strategic Communication and Capacity-Building Program, and Senganen o Mindanao (Hope for Mindanao). Brigadier General Yegor Barroquillo Jr., commander of the Army’s 103rd Brigade, said they organized the basketball game to provide a platform for confidence-building measures and strengthen relations among different stakeholders as they work together for the “healing of the past and genuine reconciliation.” “This is only the beginning of our program. We will have more of this in the next few months,” he said. Barroquillo said it has tapped the MILF in the fight against the Dawlah Islamiyah and its allied groups in Lanao del Sur and asked the former rebels to help in ridding the province of rido (clan wars) that have been hurting the government’s peace and order campaign. Aliyah Adam, the coordinator for the Strategic Communication and Capacity Building Program, said there were concerns a few months back about how to keep communication lines between MILF and government forces open, especially at the grassroots level. She and other stakeholders said the use of sports as a means for unity and collaboration was a positive step toward sustaining the gains of the peace process, in this case, in the Lanao provinces. The military said it would hold more basketball games each month in Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte. At least 24 soldiers, policemen, and MILF members fought it out on the basketball court as red and green teams. Each team was composed of a mix of soldiers, policemen, and MILF members who worked together as a group against the other. The red team won the first of the series of games, and the next game between the two teams would be held in Munai town in Lanao del Norte on February 12. The third game would be held in Butig town in Lanao del Sur. At the basketball court on Sunday, sweat and determination glistened on the players’ faces as they battled, and each point scored a small victory in the ongoing efforts to sustain the gains of the peace process. But it was not just the game that brought them together, but the shared laughter, the camaraderie, and the sense of purpose that day, officials said. “At that moment, we were no longer adversaries, but brothers united for a common cause,” said Abbas. As the final whistle blew, signaling the end of the first game, those who watched it could not help but be struck by the symbolism of the moment: after years of hatred and violence, it is possible to come together and find common ground. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/must-watch-video-game-screen-adaptations-not-the-last-of-us/,[],"Video game adaptations have long had to fight the misguided notion that they can be more than just campy, lowbrow entertainment, with the majority being either so-bad-it’s-good romps or commercial failures, panned by fans and critics alike. So much so there’s a belief that Hollywood has some sort of video game movie curse preventing it from ever putting out a successful adaptation. It wasn’t until these recent years when the conversation changed, and many realized that the characters and stories from video games can actually work on another medium. While HBO’s The Last of Us greatly helped in that regard, it doesn’t deserve all the credit as there have been a number of shows and movies released before it that have managed to find similar success. Here are five that you can check out: Sitting at a 100% approval rating from critics and a 96% rating from viewers on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, as of writing, Arcane: League of Legends is perhaps the most well-received video game adaptation to date. The nine-part series manages to enthrall fans by expanding the deep lore of League of Legends, focusing on the origins of two popular Champions, sisters Vi and Jinx, while satisfying newcomers with a compelling narrative and gorgeous visuals that combine hand-painted and computer-generated art. It doesn’t matter whether you like animation or not, or whether you have any connection to the game, Arcane is simply a stunning piece of television that’s well worth your time. Arcane’s first season is streaming now on Netflix, with a second already in production. Detective Pikachu isn’t out to redefine cinema, or be anything more than a fun, family-friendly blockbuster. That, however, has worked more to its favor rather than its detriment, turning out as a delightful adventure that can appeal even to those who don’t know a single thing about Pokémon. Fans of the international phenomenon, however, are sure to get a kick out of seeing some of their favorite pocket monsters in a live-action movie hybrid thanks to the dazzling special effects work. Spanning four stellar seasons, Castlevania takes the best parts of the popular video game franchise of the same name and creates something wholly original with it. That’s perhaps what’s so great about the series – it’s willingness to stray from its source material to better suit the storytelling format of an episodic series. Yet there’s no mistaking it for anything other than Castlevania. You can expect an engaging dark fantasy story, gothic horror, and plenty of action. All four seasons of the series are now streaming on Netflix, with a sequel already in the works. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners ticks all the boxes of late 80s to early 90s anime favorites – edgy protagonists, stylish fight sequences, and over-the-top violence. More than that, however, the 10-episode series works both as a standalone series that you can enjoy in a vacuum or a companion piece to Cyberpunk 2077. If you’ve played the game, you’ll surely enjoy seeing Night City from a different lens and learn more about what life is like there. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is now streaming on Netflix. Much like Detective Pikachu, Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, are entertaining comedies that your whole family can enjoy. The overall success of the two movies has to do with how well Sonic’s infectious charm translates from video game to the big screen. Adding to that, he’s still as fast as ever, making for some cool action scenes that’ll likely please fans of the long-standing SEGA franchise. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now streaming on HBO Go Asia. – Rappler.com"

Yokohama’s American import Charles Jackson then responded with a dunk on the other end to break the deadlock, before Kyoto’s Jotaro Mitsuda quickly countered with a trey to put the Hannaryz up by 1, 78-77, with 23 seconds remaining. Unfortunately for the Hannaryz, Jackson once again delivered a crucial basket for the B-Corsairs with only 10 seconds on the game clock, which went on to be the game-winner, as Cheick Diallo committed a costly turnover for Kyoto in the next play. Yuki Kawamura lifted Yokohama with 26 points, while Jackson posted a double-double of 20 points and 12 rebounds. Jarrod Uthoff topscored for Kyoto with 23 points, while Wright, who shot an efficient 5-of-9 clip from three-point range, also tallied 2 rebounds, an assist, and a steal. On the other hand, Dwight Ramos stuffed the stat sheet for the Levanga Hokkaido as they exacted revenge on the Kawasaki Brave Thunders, 102-95. Coming off a 13-point outing in Hokkaido’s 98-79 loss to the same opponents on Saturday, January 28, the fit-again Ramos, who missed 19 straight games from November to January due to an ankle injury, produced 10 points on 3-of-4 shooting, 5 rebounds, 4 assists, and a season-high 6 steals. Hokkaido’s Brock Motum proved too much for Kawasaki to handle as the Australian import exploded for 39 points on a very impressive 7-of-8 clip from long distance.

https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/up-diliman-arts-culture-festival-2023/,[],"This is a press release from UP Diliman – Office for Initiatives in Culture and the Arts. In celebration of the National Arts Month this February, the UP Diliman Arts and Culture Festival 2023 takes place from February to March 2023 with the theme, “KALOOB: Mula at Tungo sa Bayan,” to pay tribute to the achievements of the artists-scholars-creators of the nation who poured their talents and intellect into the creation of works that shed light on the FIlipino condition. The concept of KALOOB, which can mean, “present, contribution, gift, offering, donation, inheritance, memory,” gives importance to the interconnectedness of Filipinos through the spirit of giving and fellowship. The festival, therefore, serves as an opportunity to give proper value to art and culture and their role in the enrichment of human consciousness, through creative methods coupled with a critical perspective, which serve as the backbone of the University’s liberal education. The KALOOB festival has three main dimensions. First, honoring the newly appointed National Artists (Proclamation Number 1390 signed on 10 June 2022), of whom five are artist-scholars belonging to the UP community. Second, introducing to the public the new artist-scholars who create and conduct research on various aspects of art and culture under the Artist Support Program of the UP Diliman Office for Initiatives in Culture and the Arts (UPD-OICA). Lastly, officially recognizing the National Living Treasures or Culture Bearers. The festival’s creative program, physical and virtual exhibitions, interviews, discussions, and performances call on to nurture the artistic work and research by these artists-scholars-creators and share them with the UP community and the public.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/romualdez-wants-give-president-power-suspend-philhealth-rate-hike/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – House Speaker Martin Romualdez and four other top congressional leaders filed a measure seeking to give the Philippine president authority to suspend the scheduled increase in monthly contributions of members of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). House Bill No. 6772 seeks to amend the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act and add a provision that says the president, upon the PhilHealth board’s recommendation, may “suspend and adjust the period of implementation of the scheduled increase of premium rates during national emergencies or calamities, or when public interest so requires.” Aside from the House Speaker, other authors of the bill are House Majority Leader Mannix Dalipe, House Senior Deputy Majority Leader Sandro Marcos, House Deputy Majority Leader Jude Acidre, and House accounts panel chairperson Yedda Romualdez. The bill was filed on January 16, but Romualdez’s office publicized the proposed measure on Sunday, January 29. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. already hit pause on PhilHealth’s scheduled increase of the premium rate and income ceiling for 2023, citing “prevailing socioeconomic challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.” He did so through a memorandum in early January asking the state health insurer and the Department of Health to postpone the rate hike. In January 2021, when then-president Rodrigo Duterte wished to suspend the PhilHealth rate hike due to the pandemic, his health secretary Francisco Duque III said that doing so requires an amendment to the UHC law from Congress. Duterte eventually got what he wanted, and PhilHealth at the time explained the “interim arrangement will be good until Congress is able to pass a new law” allowing the deferment of the scheduled rate hike. PhilHealth had said that “should there be no new legislation passed for this purpose, the state health insurer will proceed with the scheduled premium rate and ceiling as provided for in the UHC law.” Under the UHC law, premium rates shall gradually increase from 2.75% in 2019 to 5% for 2024 and 2025. Before the issuance of the Malacañang memorandum in early January, PhilHealth’s premium rate was expected to go up from 4% to 4.5% in 2023. The income ceiling was also supposed to increase from P80,000 to P90,000. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-30-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Russian forces claimed incremental gains in eastern Ukraine on Monday, January 30, adding up to their biggest advances in months, after relentless battles that Kyiv described as human wave attacks which showed Moscow had no regard for the lives of its own men. The administrator of Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk province, Denis Pushilin, claimed troops had secured a foothold in Vuhledar, a coal mining town whose ruins have been a Ukrainian bastion since the outset of the war. A day earlier, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said his fighters had secured Blahodatne, a village just north of Bakhmut, a city that has been the focus of sustained Russian attacks for months. Kyiv said it had repelled assaults on Blahodatne and Vuhledar, and Reuters could not independently verify the situations there. But the locations of the reported fighting indicated clear, though gradual, Russian gains after around two months in which front lines had largely been frozen in place. “The situation is very tough. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other sectors in Donetsk region – there are constant Russian attacks,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Sunday. “The enemy does not count its people and, despite numerous casualties, maintains a high intensity of attacks.” Vuhledar sits south of Bakhmut, near where the eastern frontline protects Russian-controlled rail lines supplying Moscow’s forces in southern Ukraine. Mykola Salamakha, a Ukrainian colonel and military analyst, told Ukrainian Radio NV that Moscow’s assault there was coming at huge cost. “The town is on an upland and an extremely strong defensive hub has been created there,” he said. “This is a repetition of the situation in Bakhmut – one wave of Russian troops after another crushed by the Ukrainian armed forces.” In recent weeks Western countries have pledged hundreds of modern tanks and armored vehicles to equip Ukrainian forces for a counter-offensive to recapture territory later in 2023. But delivery of those weapons is months away, leaving Kyiv to fight on through the winter in what both sides have described as a meat grinder of relentless attritional warfare. After Russia exhausted its military with a failed assault on Kyiv last year, Ukraine’s forces counter-attacked and recaptured swathes of territory in the autumn. But that advance has stalled since November, allowing Russia to retake the initiative. Moscow’s Wagner mercenary force has sent thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons into battle around Bakhmut, buying time for Russia’s regular military to reconstitute units with hundreds of thousands of reservists. Zelenskiy said the West must hasten the delivery of its promised weapons so that Ukraine could go back on the offensive. “Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces,” said. “So we have to make time our weapon.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western countries supplying arms leads “to NATO countries more and more becoming directly involved in the conflict – but it doesn’t have the potential to change the course of events and will not do so”. The Institute for the Study of War think-tank said on Monday “the West’s failure to provide the necessary materiel” last year was the main reason Kyiv’s advances had halted since November. That had allowed Russia to apply pressure at Bakhmut and fortify the front against a future Ukrainian counter-attack, its researchers said in a report, though they said Ukraine could still recapture territory once the promised weapons arrive. Zelenskiy met Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday in Mykolaiv, a rare visit by a foreign leader close to the front. The city, where Russia’s advance in the south was halted, had been under relentless bombardment until Ukraine pushed the front line back in November. Zelenskiy’s office released footage of the president greeting Frederiksen with a handshake on a snowy street before entering a hospital where they met wounded soldiers. While Kyiv has won weapons from the West, Moscow has turned to allies including Iran, which Kyiv and the West say has provided Russia with hundreds of long-range “suicide drones” used to attack Ukrainian cities. Over the weekend, an Iranian military factory was hit by a drone attack that a US official said appeared to have been carried out by Israel. Israel has not commented. Kyiv implied that the attack on Iran was payback for Tehran’s military support for Russia: “Explosive night in Iran,” senior Zelenskiy aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted. “Did warn you.” Iran summoned the charge d’affaires at Ukraine’s embassy over Podolyak’s remarks. Russia said the strike on Iran “could have unpredictable consequences for peace and stability in the Middle East.” Unlike many Western countries, Israel has stopped short of openly arming Kyiv, but it is seen as alarmed by Russia’s reliance on Iranian drone technology it views as a regional security threat. Russia’s invasion, which it launched on Feb. 24 last year claiming it was necessary to protect itself from its neighbor’s ties with the West, has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/mongolian-president-vetoes-controversial-social-media-law/,['GEMMA B. MENDOZA'],"MANILA, Philippines – In a press conference on Monday morning, January 30, a spokesperson for Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh announced he has decided to veto a controversial “law to protect human rights on social networks” that was hastily passed by parliament on January 20. The veto means that the law, which – despite its avowed objectives – has the potential to seriously violate rights to free expression, will return to parliament for a second discussion. In her newsletter, Duuya Baatar, who heads Nest Center NGO, the civil society group that operates Mongolia’s lone fact check group, Mongolia Fact Check, told Rappler that for the law to be completely annulled however, their parliament still needs to act on the veto. “It’s like an appeal. Because the parliament holds the highest power to pass legislation in Mongolia, it can’t be completely annulled just because the president has vetoed it. In a sense, the president’s veto is simply a way of asking the parliament to review its decision. So there has to be a parliamentary session to discuss the law again.” Civil society groups and journalists in Mongolia were alarmed when the country’s parliament passed a new law on January 20, supposedly to “protect human rights on social media.” Approved less than three days after it was introduced to the public for the first time, human rights groups say the law threatens free speech and gives the state the ultimate power to regulate content on tech platforms. In an interview with Rappler, where she spoke in Mongolian and where Baatar served as translator, lawyer Narantsetseg Batsaikhan, CEO of Fidelitas Partners LLP, said the process by which the law was passed violated Mongolia’s Law on Legislations which stipulates that public discussion is required before any law can be submitted to parliament. Batsaikhan said there are exceptions to this law, such as economic safety and security reasons. But she pointed out that the proposed social media law does not fall under those exceptions. Batsaikhan also said that many of the provisions on supposed content violations by the new law were actually covered by existing laws. She expressed concern over having these provisions covered by another law, particularly one which vests the power to a unit of government – the proposed “public relations unit” to be created under Mongolia’s Public Center for Combating Cyber Attacks and Violations. It concentrates broad powers on a single unit of state. The unit then becomes both the “police, prosecutor, and court,” she pointed out. It then becomes the intermediary between citizens and the 3.5 million citizens of Mongolia. The main danger, she said, is that decisions could be very subjective. What critics are particularly concerned about are amendments made to existing laws which allow the government to shut down a communication network in case of social unrest. Critics feel this is in reaction to widespread protests in late 2022, despite freezing winter temperatures, due to corruption. “People on social media are expecting that this could be because of scheduled protests in spring,” Baatar told Rappler. Baatar said some critics believe that the government has already tested controlling communication access following the protests. She explained that many of those who joined the protests coordinated via social media. Some found it difficult to connect. “There are people who think that this was already done,” Baatar said. For now, the ball is back in parliament’s court. Now that the President has vetoed it, parliament needs to review their previous decision, Baatar explained in a message to Rappler. Two-thirds of the parliamentarians present at the session will then have to vote in favor of the veto to have it annulled. Parliamentarians can still keep their previous decision but they need to get more votes to overturn the veto. “In a sense, we have crossed our first level and the second level now is to persuade at least 50 MPs to agree that this law violates human rights. Mongolian parliament has 76 members.” Duuya noted, however, that Mongolia’s parliament adjourns twice each year: one in winter after closing the autumn session and once in the summer after closing the spring session. The Speaker of Parliament, Gombojaviin Zandanshatar, will need to declare an irregular parliamentary session, Batsaikhan said. “They adjourned as soon as they passed this controversial law, so the MPs are currently on break,” Duuya told Rappler. “The speaker of the parliament holds the power to call in an irregular session, to summon MPs from their vacation.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/editorials/rodrigo-duterte-bato-dela-rosa-nothing-to-fear-if-you-are-innocent/,[],"Papalapit na ba ang karma ni dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte? Nitong Enero 27, umakyat na sa warrants stage ang proseso sa International Criminal Court (ICC). Itutuloy na ang imbestigasyon sa mga pagpatay noong kasagsagan ng giyera laban sa ilegal na droga, pati sa mga pagpatay na naganap sa Davao City noong mayor pa noon si Duterte. True to form, umapir muli si Digong at nagpuputak laban sa mga paborito niyang pitikin, ang mga oligarchs at pangunahing negosyante ng bansa. Actually, been there, done that, Mr. Duterte. At napansin mo ba na hindi naman nangatog ang mga oligarch sa bago mong patutsada? ‘Yan ang pakiramdam ng wala na sa sentro ng kapangyarihan. Mr. Duterte, nagbago na ang ihip ng hangin. Nanayo ba ang balahibo mo? Hindi ‘yan multo – hustisya ang tawag diyan. “He won’t let foreigners judge him.” ‘Yan naman ang balik ng kanyang dating spokesman na si Harry Roque. Maaaninag mo ang lumang Dutere-Roque tandem na mahusay sa mass psychology. Muli nilang ikinakabit ang pagtugis sa dating presidente sa “nasyonalismo.” “Foreign meddling” ba ito? Sabi ni Justice Secretary Boying Remulla, “The issue is sovereignty.” Pero hindi ba’t sinuspinde nga ng ICC ang proseso nito para bigyan ng pagkakataong maaksiyunan ng kasalukuyang administrasyon ang mala-Holocaust na krimen laban sa sangkatauhan na naganap sa Davao pa lang hanggang 2020? Ayon sa ICC, hindi nito intensiyong palitan ang criminal justice system ng isang bansa, at pumapasok lamang ito sa eksena sa pagkakataong “unwilling or unable to do so genuinely” ang gobyerno. Kontento ba kayo sa mga hakbang na ginawa ng gobyerno ng Pilipinas upang mabigyang hustisya ang tinantiya ng independiyenteng Commission on Human Rights (CHR) na nasa 27,000 na biktima ng EJK? Ayon sa CHR, 20 lamang ang dinidinig sa korte, 33 kasong kriminal ang nasa Office of the Ombudsman, at 34 ang pending sa mga piskal. May 93 administrative cases sa PNP Internal Affairs Service at 37 sa Ombudsman. Mapunta naman tayo kay Senador Bato dela Rosa, ang unang nagpatupad ng tokhang. Ikaw din ang hepe ng pulisya ng Davao nang namayagpag and Davao Death Squad doon. May cinematic ka pang hugot: “Fear of the unknown… But now I have no more fear.” Pero bakit tila dama namin ang kaba mo Senador? Balisang-balisa ba ang tulog mo? Berdugo ang tawag kay Jovito Palparan sa pagdukot ng dalawang babaeng aktibista ng University of the Philippines, at nahatulan ng 30 taong pagkakabilanggo. Anong tawag sa ‘yo? Ayon sa testimonya ng dating pulis at hitman na si Arturo Lascañas, hindi lang ikaw ang “enabler” ng Davao Death Squad – pati si Senador Bong Go, na right hand man ni Mayor Digong noon. Para sa mga biktima ng extrajudicial killings, tila habambuhay ang paghihintay sa pag-usad ng hustisya. Hindi tulad ng mga kaaanak ng mga biktima ng Maguindanao massacre na naghintay ng isang dekada bago makamit ang closure, hindi malinaw ang timetable ng ICC. May iba pang sumulpot na mga legislation sa ibang bansa na nagbibigay ng kaunting pag-asa. Andiyan ang Magnitsky Act ng Estados Unidos, ang tinaguriang “Sergei Magnitsky Law of Canada,” at may ganito ring batas sa European Union. Marami pang nakasalang sa ibang lugar tulad ng Australia. Sa ilalim ng ganitong batas, ma-de-deny ang visa ng mga human rights violators at mapi-freeze din ang kanilang mga asset sa abroad. ‘Yan ang ginamit laban kay Pastor Apollo Quiboloy na inakusahan ng human trafficking at ngayo’y wanted sa US. Paano na ang mga ariarian sa States? Paano na ang shopping sa Paris at Milan? Kaya ba tila hindi sumasama si Bato sa mga junket ni Pangulong Marcos? Sabi nga ni Martin Luther King, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Gaano man kabagal at masalimuot, kumikiling daw ang “moral universe” sa hustisya. Ang ICC ay isang pandaigdigang entablado. Pero hindi foreign pressure ang tanging susi sa panunumbalik ng tunay na hustisya sa Pilipinas. Dapat itong i-sustain ng taumbayan sa isang malawakang kilusan para sa katarungan. Simulan ito ng gobyerno ni Ginoong Ferdinand Marcos Jr. sa pagkilala sa mga krimeng naganap nitong nakalipas na anim na taon na may basbas ng Malacañang. Bakit? Dahil tayo ang magmamana sa isang pulisyang walang propesyonalismo, walang respeto sa buhay ng tao, at ibinenta ang kaluluwa kay Duterte. Dahil tayo ang magmamana sa impunity. Ngayon ang tanging masasabi namin kay Digong at Bato ay ang paborito nilang linya: Kung wala kayong kasalanan, walang dapat ikatakot. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/fil-am-sundance-shorts-review-when-left-me-boulevard-vacation/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"Filipino-Americans left an indelible mark on the 2023 Sundance Film Festival with their unique and personal short films. Kayla Abuda Galang, a talented filmmaker born in Olongapo City and raised in San Diego and Houston, received the Grand Jury Prize at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival for her short film When You Left Me On That Boulevard. Meanwhile, Jarreau Carrillo, a filmmaker of Filipino and African American descent, was also honored with the Short Film Special Jury Award for Directing for his outstanding work on The Vacation. With their recent success, Galang and Carrillo have now firmly established themselves as rising filmmakers in the industry. Both are now looking forward to bringing their stories to the big screen with the creation of feature-length films. Galang plans on developing two features: ’06-’07, a coming-of-age comedy set in mid-2000s southeast San Diego, and On Earth as It is in Heaven, a comedy about familial grief set in present-day Houston. Carrillo, on the other hand, made The Vacation as proof of concept for his debut feature film entitled The Last to Survive in America, which has now been picked up by Range Media Partners. See below the reviews of each Sundance short film: Kayla Abuda Galang’s tribute to mid-2000s teenage life portrays the rich tapestry of Filipino-American heritage, where the fondness and affection of its people are on full display. Set in 2006, Boulevard follows the delightful escapades of teenage girl Ly (Kailyn Dulay), as she indulges in weed along with her cousins before a lively Thanksgiving dinner. Aside from that, Ly must navigate the tumultuous waters of her own heart as she struggles to decipher the mixed signals from her crush and contend with her boisterous yet loving auntie. Brimming with a boundless heart and community spirit, Galang extends kindness and compassion to her youth. She delves deep within her soul, mining her memories of Thanksgiving gatherings with Filipino-American families from San Diego all the way to Houston. From these treasured recollections, she weaves a heartwarming kaleidoscope of togetherness, a prism of familial love that is unpretentious in its scope and authentic in its embrace. Dulay, as Ly, is so perfectly reserved and quiet. Donning long black hair with bangs, subtle expressions so as to not look like she’s overdoing anything, and piercing eyes that hold a thousand thoughts — she is the quintessential 2000s teen. Elle Rodriguez plays Auntie Pinky and gives it her all, not just in karaoke singing but also with her portrayal as that one aunt you know who just grabs the entire attention of the room with her energy. Ly’s mother, Pacencia (Melissa Arcaya), and her cousins, Jamie (Whitney Agustin) and Crizzy (Gina May Gimongala), all wonderfully embody the constant fixtures in a typical teenager’s life — always caring, occasionally chaotic, but never judgmental. Filling up the house is an abundance of titos, titas, lolos, and lolas, as well as the playful pitter-patter of little feet as impatient children dart through the halls. It’s a cacophony of Filipino customs and habits that Galang’s camera observes without any hint of cynicism. Boulevard succeeds because of how personal it is. The film lives and breathes through its community, and it just so happens that community is one of the most generous and wacky of all. It is a memory, captured in all its rough edges and broken lines, translated onto the screen for all to see and feel. It’s the last day of summer. In a quaint, unassuming vehicle, a stream of hypotheticals unfolds. It stars Aaron (Drew Morris), an overworked man who simply wants to take a vacation and take his mind off things, but his car won’t start, and his customers keep intruding on his humble sanctuary. Later on, Aaron’s three friends, Devin (Jarreau Carrillo), Freddie (Ohene Cornelius), and Trae (Trae Harris), a vibrant assembly of contrasting personalities and idiosyncrasies, come inside his compact car to discuss wanting to go to the beach even though the destination remains ever elusive. Writer-director Jarreau Carrillo wants you to intently listen in on their conversations, resonate with their aspirations, comprehend their struggles, and revel in their camaraderie. It is tightly shot, with minimal camera movement and flashiness, likely caused by the small space the film operates in. But that space speaks to the film’s strength, because it allows for the vulnerabilities of each African American character to be fully explored without the distractions of glamorous sets. The beach is an idea of rest and relaxation, a longing in the mind, no different from Trae’s sequin dress, Freddie’s Coachella fantasy, or Devin’s suburban utopia. The writing is remarkably funny, too. Devin is the target of jokes and conversations surrounding the stark contrast between the experiences of Black and White Americans. Freddie refers to him as “socially conditioned,” while Aaron labels him as “a slave,” to which Devin responds with a hilarious callback to a senseless Kanye quote. And so the short film exudes a light-hearted and playful nature, capturing a slice of life with its own inimitable charm. Carrillo has a web series full of these kinds of short vignettes on his YouTube channel called Somewhere in the Meantime (my favorite episode is iMnDaTrUnk, which is about a woman deciding to take up breast implants and artificial insemination). Each episode is centered around a character’s honest desires shared with someone else and is imbued with a profound sense of humor. Carrillo’s artistic voice is undeniable, his voice resonates clearly, and it’s one that is both relatable and captivating to behold. The Vacation ends, and you’re left pondering what the titular “vacation” really was. But as Trae says, “there’s always next summer,” and then the next one after that, and so on. For, above all else, Carrillo’s film is not about fleeting things, but rather a reminder of companionship’s enduring ring and the solace that can be found in dreams yet to spring. – Rappler.com"

The allegations have sullied the reputation of the military institution, and the murder cast a shadow of suspicion over the heads of a general and a group of soldiers under the 10th Infantry Division in the Davao Region. And as citizens cry out for justice and the police work to bring the suspects to court for trial, the Army has been plunged into a public relations nightmare. In the face of the scandal, Brawner called on soldiers to remain professional and focus on their jobs, maintaining the culture of excellence during the change of command ceremony at the 10th Infantry Division headquarters in Camp General Manuel Yan Sr. in Mawab, Davao de Oro, on Friday, January 27, He acknowledged the backlash and negative public perception of the Army as a result of the police’s findings and complaint for murder against former 1001st Brigade commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III, a colonel, and six enlisted soldiers. Two John Does were also linked to Plaza’s December 29, 2022 vigilante-style murder in Davao City. “We are being bashed, the Philippine Army and this division (10th ID), by a lot of people because of the activities of a few of our members. Let us remain professional. Let us focus on our job and give it the best we can and always maintain a culture of excellence. Let’s not listen too much to the noise outside. Let’s not allow this to affect our morale. Let us just do our job the best we can,” Brawner said. At the same time, Brawner said the Army would never condone criminal acts committed by any of its personnel, regardless of their ranks. He was in Davao de Oro province to install Major General Jose Eriel Niembra as the new 10th ID commander under which the 1001st Brigade falls. Durante has been relieved, too, of his duties as commander of the Army brigade to allow an impartial and thorough investigation into his alleged involvement in the murder of Plaza. Brawner said that the murder was not military service-related. Like Durante, Niembra also headed the Presidential Security Group (PSG) during the administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte. He preceded Durante in the PSG. As 10th ID chief, Niembra would be responsible for Army operations in the whole of Southern Mindanao. He replaced retiring Major General Nolasco Mempin. Niembra, a native of Polomolok, South Cotabato, has served as Army inspector general, and chief of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP). He was also the commander of the 701st Infantry Brigade in Davao Oriental and the 58th Infantry Battalion. On Wednesday, January 25, the Davao police accused Durante of masterminding the murder of Plaza and filed a complaint against him and nearly a dozen other mostly Army soldiers. The nine other respondents are the following: On Sunday, January 29, Brigadier General Oliver Maquiling, the commander of the Davao Oriental-based 701st Brigade, said he and his troops were unaffected by the public criticism as an offshoot of the Plaza murder because “it is a personal matter and not work-related.” Maquiling said, “The incident came as a shock to us. However, it is important to note that as an organization, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards criminal behavior, regardless of the individual’s role or position. The morale among our team remains high.” The 701st Brigade is responsible for military operations in all of Davao Oriental and some parts of Davao de Oro, Agusan, and Surigao provinces. – Rappler.com"

House Minority Leader Marcelito “Nonoy” Libanan said that Romualdez introduced the President’s son as his special assistant, and asked the lawmakers to “brief the young man on the role and work of the House minority bloc.” “[Vinny] will be mentored on the daily grind at the House of Representatives, including the role and interaction of various committees and departments on the legislative processes, as well as strategies to help expedite the passage of vital bills and other measures for the benefit of the Filipino people,” Romualdez’s office said. “Speaker Romualdez is expected to supervise and oversee his training,” the press release also read. Vinny, 25, graduated from Oxford Brookes University in Britain, and worked as a software engineer in Singapore. Vinny appears to be following in the footsteps of his eldest brother Sandro Marcos, who, prior to getting elected to the lower chamber, served in the legislative staff of then-House majority leader Romualdez.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/children-diagnosed-hand-foot-mouth-disease-banga-south-cotabato-january-27-2023/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – An outbreak of the highly-contagious Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is gripping the town of Banga in South Cotabato, as local authorities confirm several dozen children have been infected. As of January 27, at least 51 children, with ages ranging from one to 10 years, have been diagnosed with the disease, prompting Banga’s Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO) to take drastic measures to contain the spread, including the immediate disinfection of all elementary schools in the town. A viral infection caused by the Coxsackie virus, the disease primarily affects infants and children, but can also occur in adults. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and small blister-like eruptions in the mouth and on the hands and feet. These blisters can cause pain and make it difficult for children to eat or drink. “We are facing a dire situation here in Banga,” said Joseph Franco, head of the MDRRMO. Initial reports, he said. indicate that at least 15 of our 22 barangays have infected residents, and the numbers are rising rapidly. Dr. Cynthia Corneta, the head of the town’s health office, said they immediately distributed hygiene kits to residents of affected barangays, especially to the families of the infected children, and urged them to isolate the kids for a week to prevent the disease from spreading further. “HFMD is a recurring issue in our town, but the scale of this outbreak is unprecedented,” said Corneta. “We are urging all residents to take immediate action to protect themselves and their loved ones, as we race against time to contain this outbreak.” Banga resident Edlaire Garcia, whose toddler is HFMD-infected, complained about the difficulty in accessing Isoprinosine, a drug that was prescribed to treat the infection. He said they searched for the medicine in Banga, nearby towns, and Koronadal City, but found none. But the Soccsksargen Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Unit has announced that there was no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease. While the infection typically resolves on its own within a week or two, severe cases can lead to complications. There is no specific treatment for HFMD, but over-the-counter pain relievers can be used to reduce fever and discomfort. Frequent hand-washing and avoiding close contact with people who are infected with hand-foot-and-mouth disease may help reduce the risk of infection, Corneta said. In 2022, the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Soccsksargen issued a memorandum to all school officials to be aware of the concerns raised about the rising number of HFMD infections in the region vis-à-vis the opening of full face-to-face classes. The memorandum stated that the vaccine for the virus causing HFMD was still being developed, thus the need to raise awareness on how to prevent infection. While HFMD is normally mild and self-limiting, complications like dehydration, meningitis, or encephalitis can occur. – Rappler.com"

Stoltenberg is in Seoul, the first stop on a trip that will include Japan and is aimed at strengthening ties with US allies in the face of the war in Ukraine and rising competition with China. In meetings with senior South Korean officials, Stoltenberg argued that events in Europe and North America are interconnected with other regions, and that the alliance wants to help manage global threats by increasing partnerships in Asia. Speaking at the Chey Institute for Advanced Studies in Seoul, he thanked South Korea for its non-lethal aid to Ukraine, but urged it to do more, adding there is an “urgent need” for ammunition. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. South Korea has signed major deals providing hundreds of tanks, aircraft and other weapons to NATO member Poland since the war began, but South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has said that his country’s law against providing arms to countries in conflicts makes providing weapons to Ukraine difficult. Stoltenberg noted that countries such as Germany, Sweden, and Norway had similar policies but have changed them. “If we don’t want autocracy and tyranny to win, then (the Ukrainians) need weapons, that’s the reality,” he said. In a statement carried by state media on Monday, North Korea called Stoltenberg’s visit a “prelude to confrontation and war as it brings the dark clouds of a ‘new Cold War’ to the Asia-Pacific region.” Last year South Korea opened its first diplomatic mission to NATO, vowing to deepen cooperation on non-proliferation, cyber defense, counter-terrorism, disaster response and other security areas. – Rappler.com"

Alfredo Baloran, the head of Davao City’s disaster risk reduction and management office, said villages in three administrative districts of Davao City were affected by landslides that occurred from Saturday through Sunday. “These landslide-hit villages are not on fault lines. It was the non-stop heavy rain that caused the landslides,” Baloran told Rappler on Sunday, January 29. Landslides hit the Malabog-Paquibato Road in the Paquibato District. Baloran said the affected roads were only passable to light vehicles. In Sitio Pangyan, Barangay Tamugan in Marilog District, landslides rendered the roads impassable to all types of vehicles. Road closures were also enforced in Barangay Megkawayan in the Calinan District due to road collapses, Baloran said. Baloran said road-clearing operations by the city engineering office were ongoing on Sunday. The city government has installed early warning signages on the roads of landslide-hit villages and prohibited four-wheel vehicles from passing through the areas to avoid accidents. Baloran said the Davao City government provided alternate routes in the landslide-hit villages which are among the city’s food basket. He said the city engineering office was still assessing the extent of damage to infrastructure caused by the series of landslides. In Mati City, the provincial capital of Davao Oriental province, a landslide also hit a national road in Barangay Badas late Saturday, January 28. The hillside road in Badas, which is a tourist area, is the only road that directly connects Davao Oriental to the regional center, Davao City. In a statement, the Mati City government said road-clearing operations by personnel of the city disaster risk reduction and management office were ongoing and advised the commuting public to take caution when crossing the road. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said a shear line – the point where cold and warm air meet – has continued to cause inclement weather in many parts in Mindanao. As of 8 am on Monday, January 30, it warned of heavy rainfall and raised the “yellow warning” level in eastern Misamis Oriental, Agusan del Norte, Camiguin, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur. The warning means that these areas could see 37,500 to 75,000 drums of rain per square kilometer, which could trigger more flooding and landslides. Pagasa said the shear line could also spawn occasionally heavy rain in parts of Bukidnon, Davao del Norte, Davao de Oro, Davao Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Norte, and nearby areas. Moderate rain is also forecast in some parts of the Bangsamoro region. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/unionbank-earnings-report-2022/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Aboitiz-led Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) hit a net income of P12.7 billion in 2022, up slightly from its net income of P12.6 billion in 2021. The bottomline figure, however, remained below the PSE-listed bank’s pre-pandemic net income of P14.0 billion in 2019. Its net revenues climbed 16% year-on-year to a record high of P52.2 billion, although the bank failed to post trading gains in 2022. Net interest income and fee-based income made up the bulk of revenue. Net interest income grew 31% to reach P38.9 billion, aided by the widening of net interest margins by 27 basis points to 4.9%. The universal bank attributed this larger margin to a higher proportion of consumer loans to total loans and more low-cost Current Account Savings Account deposits. UnionBank’s acquisition of the Citi consumer business and the subsequent growth of its digital customer transactions also led to strong gains in its fees and other income, which doubled to P13.4 billion. UnionBank’s total assets also expanded 31% from the previous year reaching P1.1 trillion. Customer loans climbed 42% to P479.2 billion, with growth coming from UnionBank, CitySavings, and the acquired Citi consumer business. This also came with a 25% increase in total deposits which stood at P711.3 billion. “We have a solid balance sheet that continues to provide us above industry net interest margins. The shift in digital also allowed us to grow our fees coming from mobile fund transfers and payments. We were able to book the same bottomline as the previous year, but with less reliance on trading,” said Manuel Lozano, UnionBank’s executive vice president and chief finance officer. In mid-2022, UnionBank completed the acquisition of Citi’s consumer business. The blockbuster acquisitions – which propelled UnionBank up among the top three credit card issuers in terms of usage and spends – was mainly financed by a P40 billion Stock Rights Offering (SRO). Taking into account the impact of the recent SRO, the fiscal year’s 2022 earnings yielded a return on average equity of 9.7%. “At the start of 2022, we made a commitment to execute on key strategic imperatives. First, the seamless integration of the acquired Citi consumer business, which includes customers and employees. Second, the commercial launch of UnionDigital as one of the six digital banks licensed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. We delivered on our promise and the market has rewarded us for it. Our recent stock performance, increase in stock trading volumes, and the strong commitment from our major shareholders on our Stock Rights Offering reflect shareholders’ trust in the value that will be created from the execution of our strategies,” Edwin R. Bautista, president and CEO, said in a press release. UnionBank has also appointed new executives, following the resignation of Michael Regino and Ricardo Moldez as nominee directors of the Social Security System (SSS). Their unexpired terms will be served by Rolando Macasaet and Robert De Claro. Macasaet currently serves as the president and chief executive officer of SSS. Besides being a nominee director of SSS in UnionBank, he will now also sit as a member of the executive committee, trust committee, corporate governance committee, and information technology and cybersecurity committee. De Claro is a member of the Social Security Commission and serves as the president and chief executive officer of Transpotech and Services, OPC. Likewise, De Claro will sit as a nominee director of SSS and will also be a member of the risk management committee, audit committee, market risk committee, and operations risk management committee. – Rappler.com"

Gallent took over the coaching reins from Leo Austria, who steered San Miguel to nine championships – including a record five straight Philippine Cup crowns – in his eight years at the helm. Austria also came close to guiding the Beermen to a rare Grand Slam twice when they won the first two titles of the 2016-17 and 2019 seasons. But while replicating what Austria accomplished for the fabled franchise may be daunting, Gallent finds comfort in the fact that San Miguel bosses has his back. “I’m very happy. Pressured, yes, but you know, the management is always there to support us. So, there is nothing to worry about,” said Gallent. Gallent passed his first test as Beermen head coach with flying colors as San Miguel coasted to a 114-93 romp of Phoenix to open its Governors’ Cup campaign on Sunday, January 29. The Beermen enjoyed a lead as big as 33 points before they needed to fend off the Fuel Masters’ fourth-quarter comeback. “We just have to fix a little minor things. But nothing major,” said Gallent, whose last head coaching stint in the PBA came in 2011 for the B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados. “So, the things we were doing in the past few games, we just fixed them a little.” The next order of business for Gallent is to meet Austria, admitting that he has yet to talk to his predecessor. San Miguel said Austria will remain with the Beermen as consultant amid his sabbatical from coaching, although he was nowhere to be found in the game against Phoenix at the Ynares Center in Antipolo. “Maybe in a few weeks or in a few days,” Gallent said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/emotional-novak-djokovic-hails-biggest-victory-his-life-2023-australian-open/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic said shedding tears in his players’ box following his victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open final on Sunday, January 29, was the result of an emotional collapse following his huge display of mental strength in a challenging fortnight. Djokovic called it the “biggest victory” of his career, as he claimed his 22nd Grand Slam title and won back the hearts of the home fans a year after being deported from the country. Having arrived in Australia unvaccinated 12 months ago, the 10-time Melbourne champion was deported amid a backlash from angry Australians who had endured some of the world’s toughest lockdowns as COVID-19 infections surged. But the Serbian’s woes are now well behind him and his 6-3, 7-6(4), 7-6(5) victory over Tsitsipas was met with thunderous applause from a packed crowd at Rod Laver Arena. “I have to say that this has been one of the most challenging tournaments I have played in my life, considering the circumstances,” Djokovic said in his on-court interview. “Not playing last year, coming back this year. I want to thank all the people that made me feel welcome and comfortable to be in Melbourne, Australia. “I try to pinch myself and really live through these moments and it’s a long journey… Only the team and family knows what we have been through in the last four to five weeks. This, probably, is the biggest victory in my life considering the circumstances.” It was an extraordinary two weeks for the Serbian who also managed a hamstring issue and dealt with the distraction of his father posing with fans holding banned Russian flags. “When I went into my box, I emotionally collapsed there and teared up with my mother and my brother when I gave them a hug,” Djokovic told reporters. “Because up to that moment, I wasn’t allowing myself to be distracted with things off the court or whatever was happening in dealing with an injury… that could easily have been a big disturbance to my focus, to my game. “It required enormous mental energy to stay present, to stay focused, to take things day by day and see how far I can go.” Djokovic’s father skipped the semifinal against American Tommy Paul and was also absent from the title clash. “I thought things will calm down in terms of the media and everything, but it didn’t. We both agreed it would probably be better that he’s not there,” Djokovic said. “That hurts me and him a lot because these are very special, unique moments. Who knows if they repeat again. It wasn’t easy for him. I saw him after… though he was happy to hug me, I could see he was a bit sad. “What he told me is it’s important that I feel good on the court, I win the match and he’s here for me. If it’s going to be better for me… that he’s not in the box, then so be it. “I’m also sad he was not there in the stands. But he was throughout the entire tournament, so it’s fine. In the end we have a happy ending.” In a rematch of the 2021 French Open decider, 24-year-old Tsitsipas was unable to convert the few chances he had as he failed to stop Djokovic winning his 22nd Grand Slam title. “Tough luck tonight, great battle. This is definitely not your last Grand Slam, you still have a lot of time, much more than me,” Djokovic said. “I would also like to congratulate your family and your team… You are one of the most professional tennis players that I know on the tour, and one of the most interesting guys.” Tsitsipas, who fell short of becoming the first Greek tennis player to win a Grand Slam, commended Djokovic’s contribution to the sport. “I have had the privilege to play a lot of high intensity matches, but I would like to say one more time that Novak brings the best out of me and these are the matches I have been working my entire life for,” Tsitsipas said. “He is one of the greatest in our sport and I think he is the greatest that has ever held the tennis racket. “I would like to thank you for pushing our sport so far and it deserves a player like you who pushes every single player who is involved in this sport.” – Rappler.com"

Known for his individual flashy plays, the Echo star took the back seat and allowed his teammates to shine in the Orcas’ conquest of the M4 World Championship, becoming the first player to win multiple world titles. But his evolution went beyond merely adjusting to the meta. “The biggest lesson for me is being a team player. There is no I in team, only we,” KarlTzy said in Filipino after Echo dethroned Blacklist International via a stunning 4-0 sweep in the all-Filipino grand finals. His performance in M4 proved to be in stark contrast with the way KarlTzy steered his former team Bren Esports to the M2 crown two years prior. In M2, KarlTzy produced highlight after highlight with his signature assassin and marksman heroes as he topped the tournament with 148 kills, even recording 16 kills in a single game. The 18-year-old also took home the Finals MVP honors despite being the youngest among all Bren Esports players. In M4, though, KarlTzy prioritized objectives than kills as he thrived as a utility jungler, mostly picking tank heroes to support damage dealers Benedict “Bennyqt” Gonzales, Alston “Sanji” Pabico, and Sanford “Sanford” Vinuya. A far cry from his M2 tally, KarlTzy finished with only 52 kills over 25 games in M4 and earned Game MVP honors just once. “Whoever wins MVP does not matter to Karl,” said Echo country manager Mitch Liwanag in Filipino. “He is very matured. He is very generous, and at the same time, he is very understanding now.” “He is very matured in a way that he listens to his teammates and us elders.” KarlTzy left Bren Esports over a year ago after the same core that captured the M2 championship failed to reach the Season 8 playoffs of the Mobile Legends Professional League Philippines. He eventually jumped ship to Echo, but his first stint with the Orcas ended in disappointment as they suffered a first-round exit in the Season 9 playoffs. That was when KarlTzy realized that it was time for him to adapt. “When I joined Echo, the meta already shifted to the tank meta. I did not adjust in Season 9 because I was stubborn. Then management, particularly miss Mitch, talked to me and she said it is okay to adjust,” KarlTzy said. Liwanag said she made it clear to KarlTzy that it was necessary for him to unlearn his bad habits as soon as he signed with Echo. “I knew that the kid is kind, maybe he just needed proper guidance. I saw it myself. During the first to second week, there were little adjustments. But on his own, he was giving the spotlight to his teammates,” Liwanag said. Fast forward to Season 10, although Echo failed to go all the way after bowing to Blacklist International in the grand finals, it still managed to qualify for M4, securing KarlTzy his second world championship appearance. While he no longer put up crazy numbers, KarlTzy still excelled in his newfound role. Echo finished M4 as the No. 1 team in objectives and secured the most turtles (48) and lords (37) largely thanks to KarlTzy, more often than not, winning the retribution battle. “I witnessed how he sacrificed. I witnessed how he matured. He gives what his teammates are due,” said Liwanag. Liwanag added what matters to KarlTzy the most is team success. “What he wants to be our goal is to win.” – Rappler.com"

Speaking after the Angelus prayer in Rome, the Pope said he had been greatly saddened by news of the Palestinians killed during Israeli counter-terrorism operations, as well as by the deaths of Israeli Jews in a synagogue shooting attack on Friday, January 27. “It is with great pain that I hear of the news coming from the Holy Land… The spiral of death which is growing every day does nothing but kill the little trust that there is between these two peoples,” he said. “I appeal to the two governments and the international community, and I ask them to find immediately, without wasting any time, other paths which include dialogue and the sincere search for peace,” he added. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, January 28, pledged a “strong, swift and precise” response to the synagogue attack on the outskirts of Jerusalem, as its military sent more troops into the occupied West Bank. The Jerusalem attack followed an Israeli raid on Thursday, January 26, in the West Bank city of Jenin that killed nine Palestinians, including seven gunmen, and cross-border fire on Friday between Israel and Gaza. At least 30 Palestinians – militants and civilians – have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the month. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-men-final-results-novak-djokovic-stefanos-tsitsipas-january-29-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – A ruthless Novak Djokovic resumed his reign over Melbourne Park by winning a record-extending 10th Australian Open title on Sunday, January 29, and crushing the Grand Slam dream of Greek trailblazer Stefanos Tsitsipas in a one-sided final. In a rematch of the 2021 French Open decider, Djokovic swept to a 6-3, 7-6(4), 7-6(5) victory at Rod Laver Arena to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking and again deny Tsitsipas a maiden major title. It was the Serbian’s 22nd Grand Slam crown, taking him level with Rafa Nadal at the top of the list of men’s major champions. The atmosphere was electric and the crowd often unruly as Serbian and Greek fans bayed in the terraces as if roaring on football teams. But at the finish, chants of “Nole! Nole” won out as Djokovic tore into a 5-0 lead in the final tiebreak and closed out the match with a thumping forehand down the line that Tsitsipas could only hit long. The 35-year-old Serb tapped his temple then his heart as he walked forward to shake hands with Tsitsipas before jumping into his players box where he embraced his mom and cried. Djokovic’s triumph was the ultimate redemption a year on from his sensational deportation from Australia on the eve of the Grand Slam due to his lack of COVID-19 vaccination. That dark episode seemed like ancient history on Sunday as he soaked up the cheers from his army of Serbian supporters and after winning the clash of generations. Despite saying repeatedly he bore no grudges over his deportation, Djokovic left none in doubt that the events of last year would be fuel for his success. He has had plenty of other spurs at this tournament, with heckling fans, snide commentary about the severity of his hamstring injury, and calls for his father Srdjan to be barred from Melbourne Park for mixing with Putin supporters bearing banned Russian flags. “I have to say this has been the most challenging tournament I have played in my life,” Djokovic said as he cradled the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup. “Not playing last year, coming back this year. “This is probably the biggest victory in my life considering the circumstances.” As in the semifinal, there was no Srdjan in the players’ box but Djokovic had ample support all around the showcourt. Where his left thigh had strapping in the semifinal and before, there was only a bit of tape poking out of his shorts-leg. It was a bad omen for Tsitsipas, who at Roland Garros in 2021 gave up a two-set lead to lose to the Serb. He had his chances on Sunday, including a set point in the second set, but he was unable to convert them. “Novak brings the best out of me and these are the matches I’ve been working my entire life for,” Tsitsipas said in a gracious runner-sup speech. “He’s the greatest that has held a tennis racket.” Facing a man in his 33rd Grand Slam final, Tsitsipas, in his second, was tense. He double-faulted to drop serve in the fourth game and in a flash Djokovic was 4-1 ahead, pumping his fist at the net. A wide, kicking serve wrapped up the set for the Serb, who marched to his chair contented. Tsitsipas focused on his serve and found some respite. He had a small victory when he had Djokovic tumbling on the court in pursuit of a backhand at 3-3. Djokovic grew frustrated with Tsitsipas’ resilience on serve and began mouthing off at his non-plussed coach Goran Ivanisevic. He gave up a set point at 5-4 with a backhand error to the delight of Greek fans but saved it with a forehand winner down the line. The crowd grew unruly as the set went to a chaotic tiebreak, with one fan belting out a song during a rally at 4-4. Tsitsipas cracked, hitting long twice, and Djokovic sealed the set as he did the first, with a wide, kicking serve. With the match slipping from his grasp, Tsitsipas needed a bit of luck. It came immediately as Djokovic dropped serve with a messy opening game in the third set. Tsitsipas’ moment had arrived but it was quickly gone when he missed a forehand with an open court begging. The Greek barked expletives and Djokovic pounced, breaking straight back with a patch of brilliant shot-making. From there, the Serb locked down the match with trademark control before bashing a forehand down the line to bring up three match points in the final tiebreak. He blew one with a backhand and Tsitsipas saved a second with a huge serve, but Djokovic made no mistake on the third. With his entourage having changed into T-shirts emblazoned with “10”, Djokovic held the winner’s trophy aloft once more, 15 years after hoisting it for the first time as a 20-year-old in 2008. – Rappler.com"

Jamaal Franklin finished with 26 points, 13 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocks in an all-around performance and hit a clutch triple that allowed the FiberXers to escape with their third straight win to start the conference. Down 95-106 with four minutes left, the debuting Hotshots rode on a 9-0 run highlighted by a personal six-point swing from import Eric McCree to shave their deficit to a single possession. McCree completed a four-point play after a flagrant foul (landing spot) from Converge guard Alec Stockton and flushed home a dunk in the bonus possession to pull Magnolia within 104-106. But Franklin answered the call for the FiberXers a couple of plays later, draining a well-defended three-pointer over the outstretched hands of Rome dela Rosa to give his side a 111-105 advantage with a minute remaining. Although McCree scored 4 straight points to make it 109-111 and Franklin coughed up a turnover, the Hotshots’ comeback bid still fell short. With 10 seconds left and Magnolia needing just a two-pointer to equalize, McCree lengthily dribbled the ball and missed a contested trey as time expired. Maverick Ahanmisi led all Converge locals in scoring with 22 points and 5 rebounds off the bench, while Stockton produced 18 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 assists, serving as one of the catalysts in their third-quarter breakaway. Stockton scored a team-high 7 points in the third period as the FiberXers entered the final frame leading by double digits, 84-73. Aljun Melecio and Jeron Teng added 14 and 11 points, respectively, for Converge, which ranks second in the league in scoring with an average of 121 points, just behind NLEX (122.5 points).

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/recap-kim-seon-ho-one-two-three-smile-fan-meeting-manila-january-2023/,[],"With the way Kim Seon-ho captivated fans with his heartwarming performances in South Korean series Start-Up and Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, it’s no surprise that he radiated the same warmth in person. Hours before his One, Two, Three, Smile fan meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena on Sunday, January 22, the actor first met with members of the press for a quick chat about his future ventures and to express his excitement in finally seeing his Filipino fans. “I hope that the Filipino Seonhohadas find light and hope from the fan meeting,” he said through an interpreter. Kim, known for his “good boy” image, also teased fans that he’s in the middle of experimenting with new roles as he’s currently doing a character with a “good boy and bad boy image.” He added that while the “good boy” characters that he portrayed have positively influenced him, he admitted that he’s been wanting to try a different image for his next project. This, he emphasized, is how he wants to be remembered by his supporters: someone who has developed a lot, has a big heart, and always tries hard to be a better actor. The One, Two, Three, Smile event, which served as Kim’s first solo fan meeting in the Philippines, drew a mammoth crowd of 10,000 people – which even left the actor in disbelief. After opening the show with his rendition of Paul Kim’s “Every Day Every Moment,” the actor shared how surprised he was with the number of attendees, admitting that during rehearsals, he was unsure of how the arena would be filled. “I was very shocked tonight. I almost collapsed while singing,” he said after seeing the huge crowd for the first time. “I’m very happy that since the moment I arrived at the airport, you’re always there to support me,” he told Filipino Seonhohadas. “I knew how warm you are and I felt comfortable with all of you. I can feel your hot passion.” During the two-hour show, the actor enthusiastically participated in several games with lucky attendees – from reenacting some scenes from his hit dramas, learning Filipino phrases, answering which Filipino food he’d like to try the most, and even designing a cap that was given to one lucky fan. Charina Seron, a 20-year-old college student, was one of the lucky Seonhohadas who got the chance to play with the actor on stage. “I felt like I was in a dream! I literally can’t remember anything from that moment,” she told Rappler. Sam Moralde, a 29-year-old assistant brand manager who also participated in one of the missions, agreed that she would still “cry and laugh when [she] look back on [their interaction] because it feels like a dream.” “It doesn’t feel real to me that I talked and played with Kim Seon-ho.” “When he was finally right in front of me, I didn’t feel nervous at all anymore! It felt like talking to a friend, a very extremely good looking friend…. I felt comfortable enough to even have a conversation with him,” she added. “Seon-ho has this thing about him where he looks you straight in the eye when he talks to you but it doesn’t feel intimidating at all. His presence makes you feel warm.” What was most striking to the attendees, though, was how Kim kept on thanking his fans for their unwavering support. “Thank you so much for always being with me during the hard times, even in the good times. You’re always there for me and that is big love,” he said. The actor had a personal controversy in October 2021 that led him to a short hiatus. He couldn’t help but get teary-eyed when Filipino Seonhohadas surprised him with a fan-made video with the words: “Kasama mo kami bawat araw, bawat sandali (We’ll be with you every day, every moment).” “Actually, I promised that I won’t cry…but thank you for touching my heart all the time. There were a lot of touching messages in the video but I really appreciate that you promised to be with me even through the hard times,” he said. “When I saw that he got teary-eyed during the fan-made video, I got teary-eyed as well. Parang nag-flashback lahat ng (I had a flashback of the) ups and downs of what our fandom went through the past year,” Minervs, a 29-year-old creatives manager, told Rappler. “We really went through a lot as an actor/fan and being still here on each other’s side after all those times, I believe our relation has gotten even stronger. That whatever happens in the future, we will overcome it no matter what.” “I just felt his sincerity through those words and how he values his fans. I am glad and proud that I stan a good actor not only through his works but also good to the people around him,” she added. To wrap up the fan meeting, Kim also serenaded the crowd with the song “Reason.” “I will forever treasure in my heart our special day today,” he told the crowd. “I hope that this will also be a great memory that you can look back to in your life.” “Because of you, I can stand as an actor in front of you. Thank you always and I love you.” “Maybe not as often as I hope it would be, but I promise that I’ll come back to see you again. I promise you I’ll be back with more projects in the future as a better actor to not disappoint anyone,” Kim said. “I promise to be a good person, good actor, and to be here all the time for you.” Kim also shared a photo from the fan meeting on his Instagram with the caption, “I’m happy thanks to you. I will cherish this day for the rest of my life.” – Rappler.com"

The 27-year-old phenom faced little competition after clearing a season-best 5.82 meters in his first attempt, while eventual second-placer Jie Yao of China settled for silver off a new personal record 5.75 meters in his third jump. Obiena, currently holding the Asian indoor record of 5.94 meters, tried thrice to breach the 5.90-meter mark at the Stab Velodorome, but snagged the bar each time. Home country bet Ethan Cormont bagged bronze after clearing 5.55 meters and 5.65 meters in a single attempt, edging fellow Frenchman Robin Emig, who needed two tries at the 5.55-meter level. Obiena is just three days removed from a silver-medal finish at the Internationales Springer-Meeting in Cottbus, Germany, where he nailed a 5.77-meter finish behind American Sam Kendricks’ golden 5.82-meter leap. The country’s lone pole vault bet in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Obiena is gunning for a strong buildup towards the 2024 Paris Games, where he is tabbed to be one of the Philippines’ strongest gold medal bets alongside weightlifting defending champion Hidilyn Diaz.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/horror-comedy-menu-delves-foodie-snobbery-dying-cheeseburger/,[],"This story contains spoilers about ‘The Menu.’ The Disney+ release of horror/comedy The Menu marks the beginning of what is already shaping up to be a reckoning year for the world of fine dining. The film, released this past fall, is directed by Mark Mylod, known for producing and directing the acclaimed series Succession, and satirizes the culture of high-end dining. From the perspective of our combined expertise in food and literary studies and sexuality studies, we’re interested in how the film asks us to consider what’s left when even the most fundamental bodily pleasures are turned into commodities: things that can be marketed, bought, and sold. The Menu depicts a gory confrontation between overworked restaurant workers and elite diners at the exclusive and remote restaurant, Hawthorn. The restaurant is presided over by its celebrated executive chef, Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). Reviews of The Menu often focus on Hawthorn’s wealthy customers swooning over food, its highly trained and obedient staff, or its meticulously and madly murderous chef. While these characters are compelling, they are also parodies. The most extreme example of this is foodie Tyler (Nicholas Hoult), who is so desperate to experience the esteemed chef’s cooking that he goes to Hawthorn knowing that he (and all the others) will die there. While Tyler is absurdly entertaining, the film follows the perspective of protagonist Margot, who isn’t familiar with the world of haute cuisine. Margot is not just important because viewers who don’t have much experience with fine dining culture, or who empathize with criticisms of it, can relate to her. Her perspective is also crucial to understanding the film’s interesting and complicated treatment of eating, labor, and pleasure. From the beginning, Margot balks at the restaurant’s pretentiousness and avant-garde techniques, like gelification. Viewers might identify with her eye rolls and impolite snickers, and may even do the same when, for example, a routine welcome speech delivered by the chef brings Tyler to tears. These expressive responses from Margot add humor to the film and show the ridiculousness of Chef Julian’s plans for what he calls “the greatest menu ever created.” Unlike Hawthorn’s staff and regular diners, Margot doesn’t easily fit into the distinction the chef makes between “those who give” (service workers) and “those who take” (wealthy customers). As we come to learn, Margot is also working while at Hawthorn: she is a sex worker hired by Tyler, even though he knows that it will mean her death. Like the restaurant staff, Margot is subjected to the whims and desires of insufferable (and dangerous) clients like Tyler, who have no regard for the lives of the workers whose services they employ. At the same time, Margot is a customer of the restaurant. She is the sole character who is both serving and being served. Margot is also distinct because she does not treat food as an art object or a subject to master, nor does she eat to signal her class status. Her relationship to eating is a more carnal and tactile kind of intimacy. Margot is hungry, and she demands to be fed. Others have pointed out how The Menu comments on labor conditions in the restaurant industry. This is certainly an important topic the film explores, and is especially relevant as restaurants reckon with long-standing concerns around industry sustainability that were sharply exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, given these labor issues, there are questions about whether the fine dining industry should even exist in the future — questions that have become especially public with the recently announced closure of Noma, Copanhagen, named the “World’s Best Restaurant” in 2021. However, Hawthorn’s staff is not only reducible to working-class warriors taking revenge on their oppressors. They, too, are invested in the culture of fine dining and insist on a similar kind of perfection as their diners. In an absurdly hilarious and grim take on what fine dining has become, Hawthorn’s diners and staff perform their roles — serving and being served, cooking, and eating — to their fiery (and gelatinous) deaths. Margot understands the pleasures that have been stripped from both cooking and eating. In a scene where Chef Julian asks Margot if she enjoys her work, she says she used to, but no longer does. Even so, unlike some of the others, she clearly still has a strong appetite for life and living. By asking Chef Julian to make her a cheeseburger (because she’s “still fucking hungry”), Margot both leverages her position as a customer and reminds him of the pleasure of cooking a meal that someone genuinely wants to eat. She’s the only character who actually fights for her life. It is because of these desires (to live and enjoy life) that she is the only person to leave Hawthorn alive, a delicious and fulfilling takeaway cheeseburger in tow. Although the idea of being trapped on an island at the mercy of people skilled with butcher’s knives is a frightening thought, The Menu’s real horror comes from the ways food, eating, and cooking lose their carnal pleasures under capitalism. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Melissa Montanari is a PhD Candidate in English and Cultural Studies, McMaster University.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/cats-fighting-playing-scientists-analyzed-videos-difference/,[],"Have you ever worried if the play between your cats was getting too rough? A new study published in Scientific Reports has investigated play and fighting in cats. Their aim was to use simple behaviors anyone could observe to work out what was play and what might lead to fights. This is important because the consequences of fights include injuries to animals and humans. At worst, you may even have to rehome one of your cats if they’re not getting along. The study, led by Noema Gajdoš-Kmecová from the University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Slovakia and from the University of Lincoln, UK, analyzed 105 videos of interactions between 210 cats. The research team then developed an ethogram – a list of specific behaviors used in the study of animal behaviour. These were put into six groups: The researchers used terms such as “cats play fighting” to find relevant videos on YouTube. Each video was analyzed to identify which of these behaviors were shown by each cat. Each interaction was then analyzed statistically to work out which behaviors appeared together in clusters. From this, the researchers separated the videos into three categories of interactions. Playful: included 40% of cats from the videos and included wrestling and a lack of vocalizing. Agonistic: agonistic behaviors are any social behaviours that include threatening, aggression, and submission. Cats in this group vocalized and had recurring bouts of inactivity; 32% of cats from the sample landed in this group. Intermediate: this group included 28% of cats and was more closely associated with the playful group than the agonistic group. Cats in this group interacted for prolonged periods with pauses in between. As a crosscheck, these behavioral categories observed from the videos agreed fairly well with how the four authors, experts in cat behavior, described each interaction. If your cats are wrestling, they are most likely playing. When there is friction between cats in a multi-cat household, they tend to avoid physical contact. Instead, they’ll use offensive or defensive manoeuvers that don’t involve extended direct contact, such as slapping. If your cats are vocalizing, and chasing between periods of inactivity (such as crouching) they are most likely fighting. Vocalization is an especially important clue here to an aggressive, rather than playful interaction. Chasing is okay if it’s mutual, but if one cat is chasing or one cat is running away, that’s not so positive. The intermediate group is the tricky one. It contains elements of both playful and agonistic behaviors, though was more closely related to the playful than the agonistic group. This suggests play could become agonistic, depending on what happens during the interaction. In particular, the authors observed frequent breaks within the interaction, which may allow cats to reassess their partner’s interest in playing, and avoid escalation from play to aggression. This study is the first to apply a scientific approach to cat behaviors anybody can identify, describing three types of interactions to help identify between play and fighting in cats. We all know when cats are really fighting, but the main strength is in working out intermediate examples – where it could be okay, but could also escalate. The study focused on obvious behaviors anybody can observe, but cats can be quite subtle, too. They also use facial expression, ear and tail placement, and pheromones to communicate. These subtle signals may be just as important in differentiating between what is playing and what is fighting. If your cats really are besties (sleep in close contact and share food and toys) the occasional bit of agonistic play is okay. But if your cats don’t get on as well, you might need to watch for signs of agonistic behaviours. Tension between cats is not always obvious, but can affect their physical and mental health. If you are unsure if your cats are really getting along, seeking help early from an expert in cat behavior can prevent a cat-astrophe. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Susan Hazel is an Associate Professor, School of Animal and Veterinary Science, University of Adelaide.

https://www.rappler.com/business/philippines-offer-value-added-tax-refund-foreign-tourists-2024/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has approved a value-added tax (VAT) refund program for foreign tourists by 2024 to attract more visitors, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said on Sunday, January 29. The government collects a 12% VAT on goods consumed within the Southeast Asian country. The plan is to allow foreigners to get a VAT refund on items they are taking out of the Philippines, similar to what many other countries offer. The measure is among the proposals a private sector advisory council presented to Marcos recently to boost the tourism industry, including improving airport infrastructure and operations and promoting tourism investment, the PCO said in a statement. Marcos has also approved the launch of an online visa this year for Chinese, Indian, South Korean, and Japanese tourists, it said. The Philippines recorded 2.65 million international visitors last year, who brought in an estimated $3.68 billion in revenue, exceeding its 2022 target of 1.7 million tourists, according to the Department of Tourism. Last year’s total comprised of 2.02 million foreign nationals and 628,445 Filipinos based abroad, which compared with only 163,879 tourists recorded in 2021 and was still significantly lower than the pre-pandemic annual level of 8.26 million. The government aims to boost visitor arrivals this year to 4.8 million tourists. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/army-expects-court-martial-jesus-durante-soldiers-yvonette-chua-plaza-killing/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – Lieutenant General Romeo Brawner Jr. said the Philippine Army is anticipating court martial proceedings against Brigadier General Jesus Durante III and six other soldiers for their alleged involvement in the killing of Davao businesswoman Yvonette Chua-Plaza. Brawner, the army’s commanding general, ordered the formation of a general court martial after an internal board of inquiry that investigated Plaza’s killing recommended trying Durante and the other soldiers in a military court. “At my level…I still have to ask the JAGO (Judge Advocate General Office) to review it, but I already issued an order, I ordered them to start looking for members to constitute the GCM (general court martial),” Brawner told reporters in a mix of Filipino and English on Sunday, January 29. Brawner said recommendations from the JAGO may be available as soon as this week. Davao police earlier linked Durante and seven other individuals, including six soldiers, to the killing of Plaza, calling her murder a “crime of passion.” An investigation conducted by local police showed Plaza allegedly had sensitive information against Durante, and supposedly planned to use it to blackmail him. Brawner earlier said the army had taken custody of Durante, after he was relieved of his command of the 1001st Brigade in Davao de Oro. The army also has custody of Colonel Michael Licyayo, who Davao police tagged as an accomplice of Durante. Other soldiers, meanwhile, are under the custody of the Philippine National Police, though the final arrangement in relation to custody is still under discussion with the PNP. Once convened, the court martial is expected to look into the administrative aspect of Durante and other soldiers’ alleged actions, while civil courts are expected to handle criminal proceedings. The PNP earlier filed a murder complaint against Durante, the six other soldiers, and three other men for the death of Plaza. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/people-blame-judge-parents-children-heavier-weights/,[],"The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work. Americans stigmatize parents of heavier children, specifically blaming them for their children’s weights, according to experiments conducted by our team of psychologists. The more a person views parents as responsible for a child’s excess weight, the more likely they are to view such parents as bad parents who are lazy, overindulgent, and incompetent. Our findings corroborate what parents of children with higher weights have reported for years: that other people – friends, other parents, strangers, or even their pediatricians – might blame them, dislike them and think they are poor parents. In the US, about 1 in 3 children have body mass indexes that would be categorized as overweight or obese. The number has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning an increasing number of parents face stigma on account of their child’s weight. This parental weight stigma is just beginning to receive serious scientific attention but could have major effects on parents, children, and families. For example, family courts across the US and internationally have removed children with obesity from parental custody in large part due to their children’s weights. Family separation can have massive negative effects on children. Our work suggests that if judges react as our study participants did, they may view parents of heavier children as being bad parents simply because their children are heavier. In reality, weight is not solely under personal control. In fact, dieting can cause weight gain. Excess weight arises from a complex interplay of genes, environment, diet, and activity. Psychologists also know that weight stigma is associated with pervasive negative consequences, including bullying, ignorant comments, and feelings of painful invisibility – as well as diminished educational and economic opportunities and worse medical outcomes importantly not simply due to one’s weight. Experiencing weight stigma, insidiously, might itself facilitate weight gain and cause other negative effects. If people blame and stigmatize parents of children with higher weights, what effects does it have on parents, on their children, and on the parent-child interactions that are so important for healthy development? We do not yet know, for example, if heavier children are aware people stigmatize their parents. If so, these children might not only be ashamed of their size, but also might erroneously feel responsible for how people treat their parents. For this research, published in the journal Psychological Science, we ran three experiments with over 1,000 US participants – about 75% white and 25% other races/ethnicities – over the course of 2022. We randomly assigned participants to view one of four line drawings depicting a mother or father next to an 8-year-old daughter or son. We also included a short description of the parent and child. In two of the line drawings and descriptions, the child was described and depicted as “healthy”-weight. In the other two, the child was depicted and described as having “obesity.” The parents were always depicted and described as being healthy-weight. This allowed us to conclude that study participants’ reactions to parents were due to their children’s weights, not the parents’. We asked participants a few short questions about how good or bad a parent they thought the adult was. Participants also answered questions about what they believed influenced the child’s weight (as well as their academic performance and athleticism, to help obscure the focus of the study). Participants were given 100 “responsibility points” to allot to four factors that could be behind the child’s weight: parent behavior, child behavior, genetic factors, and societal factors. As expected, people who viewed the child with obesity assigned more responsibility points to parent behavior and saw that parent as a worse parent. We found parent and child gender made little difference, consistent with other work. This is consistent with previous research showing people blame parents for children’s obesity more than people blame society or the kids themselves. We also tested whether providing alternative explanations for the child’s weight would decrease the amount of blame parents received for it. When we told participants the child had a thyroid condition that caused her excess weight, they stigmatized the mother less, holding her less responsible. Next, our team is exploring how parents’ own weight, income and race/ethnicity influences the stigma directed toward them on account of their child’s excess weight. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Jaimie Arona Krems is an Assistant Professor of Psychology, Oklahoma State University.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/jayson-tatum-reaction-blown-no-call-lebron-james-will-annoy-lakers-fans/,[],"This story first appeared on ClutchPoints. Jayson Tatum is staying mum on the blown no-call on his foul on LeBron James that allowed the Boston Celtics to force overtime against the Los Angeles Lakers and win. To recall, Tatum fouled James with less than a second left on the clock as the Lakers star was attacking the basket for the potential game-winning lay-up. Of course LeBron missed because he was clearly whacked by Tatum, but there was no whistle and the Celtics survived for OT with the game tied at 105-105. James was naturally furious over the shocking no-call, and it certainly didn’t help that the referee admitted after the game that they missed the foul call. In his postgame presser after the Celtics’ 125-121 victory, Tatum refused to go into detail over what happened in the final two minutes of the game and in overtime and emphasized that he has to watch the film to be sure. “The last two minutes and overtime was a blur. I don’t really know what happened,” Tatum said, per NBC Sports. Sure enough, Jayson Tatum knows very well what happened. He was the one who committed the foul anyway. But hey, he won’t admit to it. He doesn’t have to anyway since the referees are the one who made the mistake and he simply benefited from it. Still, Tatum’s reaction will only fuel the outrage of Lakers fans even more. As Anthony Davis said, they were basically “cheated” of the win, and it’s hard to blame him for feeling that way. It remains to be seen what the NBA will do about it, though it’s not like the results can be overturned. – Rappler.com"

The Australian wildcard pairing of Kubler and Hijikata outclassed the duo of French-born Hugo Nys of Monaco and Polish Jan Zielinski, 6-4, 7-6(4), in the final on Saturday, January 28, at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. “It’s something that we Filipinos – and the POC – should be proud of and cherish,” said Tolentino of the achievement of 29-year-old Kubler, the son of Philippine-born mother Lyn and Australian father John. “We know that a part of him is Filipino and Jason showed that to the world,” Tolentino said. “We’re really proud of him for winning a Grand Slam title not only for Australians but also for his fellow Filipinos.” It was the first Grand Slam title for both Hijikata and Kubler, the third Australian pair to win a men’s doubles title in the last five Grand Slams. They teamed up for the first time. Kubler turned professional in 2008 but couldn’t pounce on a promising career because of a knee injury that forced him to play mostly on clay. Tolentino likened Kubler’s feat to the success of Filipino-Canadian Leylah  Fernandez, who made the final of the US Open in 2021 as an 18-year-old. Kubler also made headlines in singles action early in the tournament when he shared a 70-shot rally with Karen Khachanov in their second round match. Khachanov was serving for a two-set lead in the battle between the two baseliners when Kubler managed to snare a break point. The pair slapped the ball back and forth for 90 seconds before a Kubler backhand clipped the net cord and dropped onto the other side of the court, leaving Khachanov stranded behind the baseline. The partisan crowd on the showcourt erupted in celebration and Kubler went on to take the set to level the contest at 1-1. Khachanov, however, eventually won, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. “I was super pumped,” said Kubler. “I don’t think I’ve ever had a rally that long before. You know, I’m definitely going to be sharing it on my Instagram and stuff like that.” The players would have had to go on a fair bit longer to break the record for a rally in a competitive match, which the Library of Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum believes to have taken place in 1984. Jean Hepner and Vicky Nelson shared a 29-minute rally in Richmond, Virginia in which the ball passed over the net an incredible 643 times. – with a report from Reuters/Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/things-to-know-co-parent-pet-after-breakup/,[],"Breakups are already hard and painful to begin with, but it could get even more complicated when ex-couples share a pet. Pets, after all, play a huge part in our lives, and figuring out a plan to take care of them after you and your partner have decided to part ways can be difficult, no matter how amicable the breakup is. Who gets the pet? When can your ex-partner spend some time with your pet? How will you divide the veterinary bills? Most pet owners would agree that the best interests of their furbabies should be considered top priority for this kind of set-up. And to do so, they should be prepared to get into the specifics to ensure that their pets are well taken care of despite the changes happening in their lives. We asked our Rappler readers what they thought about co-parenting a pet after a breakup, and here are their tips on how to make it work: One of the first and most important things to discuss with your ex-partner is where your pet will live, now that the two of you have separated. It’s easy if a pet was already owned by someone before they entered a relationship, but what about cases where the couple bought the pet mid-relationship, or where one half of the couple gave the pet to the other as a gift? Will the pet go to the one who gifted it, or the one who received it? Or is it the obvious favorite parent who should get the pet? Talk also about why a pet should get to stay with that specific parent. Is it because they had more experience in taking care of the pet? Or does that person have a more flexible working schedule and environment? Make each other also understand what it means to be the parent with major custody. Are they allowed to make huge and important medical decisions for the pet without talking it through with the ex-partner? If you’re taking main responsibility for the pet, also make sure it’s something that you’d really be keen to do, and not because you just want to spite your ex-partner. Figuring the set-up would be easy if the breakup was amicable and the ex-couple decided to remain friends. But how about those who are not on speaking terms or had a bad fallout? Obviously, if you’re leaving an abusive relationship, prioritize you and your pets’ safety. If the situation isn’t horrible or abusive, it’s best to agree on a schedule as well. When can the pet visit its other parent? How long can they stay there? If they’re new to one or both of the households, it might be better to split up the custody arrangements for longer periods of time so that they can have a greater opportunity to adjust to each location. Be consistent and specific with the timing, too, so that your pets will get the hang of what to expect in such situations. Rather than just vaguely deciding to split time evenly, create a plan that takes into consideration what’s going to work for all parties involved. If your ex-partner lives five hours away from you, are you willing to make them take such a long drive just for the pet’s weekend stay? Make sure to discuss all possible scenarios as well. What happens during the holidays? Is a co-parent willing to watch the pet when the other parent is traveling or has an emergency? It would be helpful if both parties agree on which pet-sitters would be on call for backup in case both of them are unable to take care of their pets for some reason. As in most cases, consistency is the key! Setting up rules regarding aspects that could influence a pet’s home life is imperative in co-parenting set-ups. Pets have the tendency to be in distress when they’re in a new environment, so to make sure that the transition will be easier for everyone, best to reinforce the same rules, routines, and boundaries at each house. If one of you allows them on the couch, but the other parent doesn’t, then this can be confusing for your pet, and an upset animal could act up. Be consistent with their exercise and feeding schedule! For example, dogs usually get used to a specific time for their morning piss, so make sure that this is maintained in both houses. As co-parents, remember to use the same language for commands, too. It could be difficult for your pet to follow a command if one parent uses “wait” when they’re used to hearing “stay.” Consistency in food is also extremely important. Agree to use the same type and brand of food and treats, and make sure that they’re fed at the time and with the amount that they’re used to. It’s also best to revisit these rules as you, your ex-partner, and pet become older. Consider the changes in each other’s lives and desires to maintain the set-up. Will you still be okay with co-parenting a pet even 10 years after your breakup? Raising a pet is a financial responsibility that could get pretty expensive – and having discussions on anything money-related with your ex could get tricky! So, better to be direct and real about it. Start by listing down the expenses of your pet, like food, preventive medicines, toys, and medical care. Then, discuss how to split the costs. Will it be split equally, or is the person with the higher income willing to pay more? Will the parent who has custody pay for the basic supplies and everyday necessities while the other parent will shoulder the larger expenses such as veterinarian bills? Aside from the expenses, it would be helpful if both parents also agreed on a spending limit for the things they’re purchasing for their pet. One parent may feel frustrated if the other spends too much on toys and treats, when they could allot it for the pet’s medical expenses instead. Iron these things out and ensure that both parties get a sense of fairness from it. And once they’ve agreed upon a plan, they should adhere to it. Before agreeing on a co-parenting set-up, make sure that the whole situation is fair for your pets and that all factors were made in consideration of their well-being. Remember that moving from one environment to the other regularly can be extremely stressful for your pets, which would lead to behavioral and medical problems. Know also that some pets have the tendency to grow more attached to a particular person and it might be detrimental for the animals to be separated from that person over and over again. Are you, co-parents, willing to risk their health just to make the set-up work? It’s important to be honest with yourself and the person you’re sharing your pet with about how you feel about your situation. Are there any changes that you two should make for the sake of your pets? Is it working for everyone involved, or is one side being treated unfairly? Don’t hesitate to make necessary adjustments to ensure that everyone’s in favor of the set-up. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/cebu-pacific-optimistic-tourism-return-full-capacity-march-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Cebu Pacific is expecting to restore “100% pre-COVID systemwide capacity” by March, but the low-cost carrier cautioned the tourism industry may take a few years to return to past levels. “We’ve been cautiously optimistic over the last 24 months. We’re quite excited for 2023, given that all these markets have opened up,” said president and chief commercial officer Xander Lao in a media event on Wednesday, January 25. Lao, however, cited two “reopening pains” that the tourism and travel industries faced: a lack of manpower and infrastructure. For the first issue, he pointed out that the workforce in other countries are shifting away from jobs with intensive physical labor, such as those in aircraft ground handling. “That’s what’s happening in a lot of the markets we operate to. Jobs are getting more expensive. Service jobs are getting more expensive, so people are graduating to that from the normal ground handling,” Lao said in a chance interview with reporters. Infrastructure was another stumbling block, such as in the cessation of Cebu Pacific flights to Batanes. Lao described the Batanes airport as “one of the more operationally challenging airports for the Philippines.” “Until such time that infrastructure improves, I don’t think we’ll be coming back to Batanes. We don’t want to offer a service, and then a few days before, i-cacancel (it’ll be canceled) because of bad weather or what-have-you,” Lao said. “Hopefully the infrastructure improves to allow us to come back. A lot of our customers are asking when we would return, but there has to be some infra improvements,” he added. Candice Iyog, Cebu Pacific chief marketing and customer experience officer, said that Cebu Pacific had tried to fly to Batanes due to high requests, but had to eventually stop. “As a low-cost carrier, one of the fundamental aspects of doing this business is being able to have predictability and consistency,” Iyog said. “Never closing doors, just not in the immediate horizon.” As of 2023, Cebu Pacific announced that it had resumed flying to 34 domestic and 25 international destinations. With the relaxation of travel requirements, the airline expected significant growth coming from its international network, according to Iyog. “We want to highlight: there are no travel requirements going into Bangkok and into Taiwan. There are no more tests required to travel to South Korea, Japan, and Australia. There are no more quarantine requirements as well going to Hong Kong, Macau, and to China,” she said. However, both executives were careful to exercise “cautious optimism” in its assessment of the tourism and travel industry. Although they expected tourism to surge in 2023 compared to previous years, they do not see the industry returning to its pre-pandemic levels just yet. “We’re quite bullish in the sense that tourism is quite an important segment of the Philippine economy, and we think that that’s going to come back. Are we going to come back to pre-COVID levels this year? Probably not. It might take us a couple of years,” Lao said. “One of the things that we did right as part of this cautious optimism is also bringing back the routes or flights to destination when all other things line up,” Iyog said. “[We’re] making sure to bring it back when the market is also ready to come back.” Both executives pointed out the importance of China’s reopening, which had long been among the top tourist markets of the Philippines. In 2022, arrivals from China had dropped to a low of 39,627, after the Chinese government implemented strict travel restrictions and sweeping lockdowns. But that is all set to change in 2023 as China bade farewell to its zero-COVID policy and once again reopened its borders. But even with the easing of restrictions, Lao believed that it would take a while for the Chinese tourist market to return to its pre-pandemic levels, which had contributed as much as 1,743,309 arrivals in 2019. “One of the things we were discussing internally was, when China does reopen, can you come back quickly to 100%? To be honest, practically speaking, that would be quite difficult because in terms of ground handling resources, are they ready? In terms of local governments in China themselves, are they ready? In terms of our own visa issuances, are they ready?” Lao said. “I think it will take awhile for the airlines to come back, but having said that, we’re quite bullish on the tourism prospects this year,” he added. – Rappler.com"

With the game tied at 105-105 and 4.1 seconds left on the clock, James attempted to drive through the Celtics defense but was fouled by Jayson Tatum, denying the Lakers veteran two points and free throws at the death. James and the Lakers were left shell-shocked as appeals for a foul were ignored as the clock ran down while Patrick Beverley even received a technical foul when he brought a photographer’s camera on court to show the referee proof of a foul. “You saw my reaction,” James said. “It’s challenging. I don’t get it. “You’ve seen some of the games we’ve lost with late-game missed calls… I don’t see it happening to nobody else.” The Celtics eventually sealed victory in overtime at the TD Garden despite James’ 41-point effort which moved him to within 116 points of all-time leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. “As much as you try not to put it on officiating, it’s becoming increasingly difficult… The best player in the NBA can’t get a call.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/grief-counseling-online-certifications-coda-story/,[],"This story was reported and originally published by MindSite News, a nonprofit digital news site focused on mental health. Republished with permission. On a Sunday afternoon in February of 2022, a daunting task loomed before me. I had to document my competency for a certificate in grief therapy, although I had no background in mental health. I logged into a continuing education company’s website and launched the six-hour pre-recorded workshop. Then I pressed the mute button and went about my day. I baked garlic bread, caught up with some friends, binged a Netflix show and took a nap. Six hours later and $239.50 lighter, I took the final test. My grade was 35 out of 38; I passed with flying colors. I proudly downloaded my “certificate of successful completion” from a continuing education provider called PESI, although I had no intention of actually hanging out a shingle as a certified bereavement practitioner. Why would I do such a thing? I’m an investigative reporter, and I wanted to see how hard it would be to game the system and pass the test without taking the course. As it turned out, it was ridiculously easy: The answers to the final quiz are summarized on the handouts shared prior to the test. Like several other online education organizations, PESI provided certifications in grief counseling for non-professionals and professionals alike. I applied for my Grief Informed Professional certification offered by Evergreen Certifications, a company owned by PESI. But Evergreen rejected my application, informing me that I needed to  demonstrate a background in mental health. However, the grief therapy industry was buzzing with other options, and I turned to an online education outfit called Udemy, signing up for its “Grief and Bereavement Counselling ACCREDITED CERTIFICATE”  – advertised for just $9.99, reduced from $94.99. The course was described as a “first step towards a professional career as a ‘bereavement counsellor.’” This turned out to be an even speedier ride than PESI. I bought the course at 1:37 am and received my certificate of completion at 1:39 am. Wait, what?! Here’s a breakdown of the blitzkrieg: The course was divided into 24 lectures; I clicked the checkbox next to each of them to confirm my attendance and moved on to the 10-question quiz, which was the last requirement to obtain my certificate. Then, as I was answering the second question, my certificate arrived by email. Call me a teacher’s pet but I felt that I should finish the test anyway. I did, earning a 100% score without opening any of the lectures or studying the material. A Udemy representative who responded to my interview request declined to talk about the certificate because, she said, she was “not a certified mental health professional.” “When we get to the area of certifications, it’s the Wild West,” said Jason Washburn, a board-certified clinical psychologist, professor and chief of the psychology division in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University. “There’s absolutely no governance…because it’s not regulated by the state or by the [U.S.] Department of Education.” With COVID-19 deaths well past 1 million in the U.S. and 6.5 million worldwide, the demand for grief counseling has exploded. Every death has a profound impact on approximately nine people, according to the University of Cambridge. Two years into the pandemic, a report showed that the percentage of Americans suffering from anxiety and depression has tripled, and drug overdoses and alcohol-related liver disease have risen as well. For some, the experience of bereavement can morph into something much deeper – an unshakable sadness that psychologists call prolonged grief disorder and is often misdiagnosed as depression. Grief counseling is also in demand in the criminal justice system: Grief counselors have worked with bereaved prison inmates and are sought after for families enmeshed in substance use disorder. Inspired by work from restorative justice advocates, courts in numerous states from California to Alabama have ordered grief counseling as part of mandated treatment  for people in criminal diversion programs – all changes that experts view as bellwethers of a less punitive future. However, there’s a tremendous shortage of trained and licensed mental health professionals to meet the demand for therapy, creating a market opportunity for people even without clinical training and licenses to work as grief therapists. To do that, they need something that attests to their knowledge –  certification. And that’s where things get confusing. Being certified in grief counseling doesn’t mean someone is a licensed counselor, but to the general public, it seems like the same thing: A certification can be easily mistaken for a professional license. Colleges and universities provide education and training in disciplines such as social work, counseling or psychology, culminating in an advanced degree. State boards administer exams and issue licenses to these professionals, giving them the right to practice. Certifications are legal, but they are neither a degree nor a license. Adding to the confusion, many clinical professionals do seek additional certifications for specialized training in narrower areas, ranging from counseling for pet loss to trainings in preventing and treating patients for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and toxic stress. Even for mental health professionals, specialization in working with bereaved people is an important need, because few have been trained in this work through their degree programs. “You can go through the entire graduate curriculum in psychology and social work, even, astonishingly, in chaplaincy or palliative care and nursing, and never hear the word grief,” said Robert A. Neimeyer, a psychology professor at the University of Memphis who also directs the Portland Institute for Loss and Transition, which offers training and certification in grief therapy. Most professionals have to take continuing education (CE) credits to maintain their licenses and certifications. Taking CE courses is critical, said Gerald Koocher, an attending psychologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and  senior lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. “Within about seven or eight years after you graduate…half of what you learned is obsolete,” he said. And while state licensing boards appear to do an adequate job of screening CE credits, certification providers may not. Perhaps the biggest reason: The terms “Continuing Education Credit” or “Continuing Education Unit” are not legally protected – meaning no organized body controls them – and are thus available to any education provider that wants to issue them. And if patients looking at their grief counselors’ certificates on the wall cannot tell the difference, what then? In 2020, Washburn of Northwestern University co-authored a study on specialty mental health certifications with two colleagues, including Gerald Rosen, a psychologist and clinical professor emeritus in the department of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle  They gave a “Certified Clinical Trauma Professional” certification test and materials to a 14-year-old, the daughter of an author’s friend. She answered all 50 questions correctly thanks to matching sentences in the study guide. In a caustic abstract, the authors wrote: “We demonstrate that an 8th grader with no prior mental health education or training can pass a test intended to assess expert levels of knowledge obtained from a workshop.” Rosen, in fact, remembers when qualifications were even more lenient. “In the 1970s, you didn’t even need to have a high school degree,” he said. “It was unbelievable. Anyone could call themselves a counselor.” But the three professors weren’t the first ones to go after the certification industry. Two decades ago, Steve Eichel, a psychologist known for his research on destructive cults and mind control, grew increasingly exasperated and dubious of credentials in his profession. He decided to credential his cat – yes, you read that right – to showcase the lack of checks and balances in the industry. “This was a surprisingly easy thing to do,” he wrote in an article published on his website. Eichel was compelled to explain himself after a reporter wrote to him in 2002 asking how to reach Dr. Zoe D. Katze. “The cat is out of the bag,” he wrote. “Dr. Zoe D. Katze, Ph.D., C.Ht. is a cat. In fact, she is my cat. Those familiar with basic German have probably already enjoyed a laugh. ‘Zoe Die Katze’ literally translates to ‘Zoe the cat.’” He reported that his cat’s credentials looked impressive and that she had been certified by three major hypnotherapy associations, “having met their ‘strict training requirements’ and having had her background thoroughly reviewed.” The psychologist was driven to certify his cat, he wrote, after hearing too many prospective clients complain that they had found someone else “with all these certifications and diplomas and he/she charges half of what you psychologists charge.” His breaking point came when he discovered another colleague online who had a PhD from “a notorious diploma mill” and listed “a veritable alphabet soup” of certifications and diplomas after his name. After Eichel added Zoe as an “authorized user” on his credit card, everything fell into place. “In the nefarious world of quasi-credentialing and diploma scams, money talks. Or at least it meows,” he wrote. After Dr. Katze received one credential, other associations that had reciprocity agreements awarded more. “Not bad for a cat that’s not even a purebred,” he wrote. Eichel noted that a banker asked for Zoe’s social security number, but “cheerfully relented when I told him it would take me some time to search for it.” The certification industry isn’t responsible for the banker’s lack of rigor, of course, but Eichel’s point still holds: It’s far too easy to pass these tests and get certified. Eichel turned more serious when he discussed the meaning of his cat’s credentials. He dismissed the idea of stricter laws on credentialing, which he thinks would do more harm than good, since what constitutes “good” therapy is hard to define. However, he called on readers to help monitor themselves, “to examine our own motivations for obtaining credentials (both legitimate and dubious), to police ourselves and our own professions, and to do our best to educate the public.” The tale of Dr. Zoe D. Katze, Ph.D., C.Ht, made a lasting impression on the experts I spoke with. Twenty years later, not once did a source fail to mention the story to me. Because 20 years later, it seems like almost no progress has been made. For consumers, certifications are supposed to signify a set of minimum competencies. But in a competitive market, credentials have also become an avenue to distinguish yourself. Quite naturally, some professionals are attracted by less expensive and less time-consuming courses that offer a quick way to get visibility or access to a network of prospective clients. I looked into six grief recovery and/or counseling certification courses for this story. Four of them – offered by the Grief Recovery Institute, the Global Grief Institute, PESI and Udemy – are among the first to come up in an internet search for grief therapy certification. Two others are offered by professional associations. I found that the rigor, the work required and the education prerequisites to seek certification varied widely. The Global Grief Institute, for example, which urges people to “get your piece of the $100 Billion dollar Coaching industry,” doesn’t require a college degree; in fact, it appears to discourage participants from getting one (see Facebook posting, left). It’s able to certify mental health newbies like myself because it markets its courses under the term “coach” – and coach isn’t a protected job title in the U.S.; neither is “professional” or “specialist.” Protected job titles such as psychologist or social worker require completion of specific training courses, usually a graduate degree in psychology or related fields. Interestingly, the designation “counselor” isn’t protected equally across the country, either: Most states require counselors to obtain a license to practice. But certain states allow unlicensed counselors to practice if they don’t advertise themselves as licensed. Since laws differ from state to state, the landscape is difficult to navigate for patients as well as professionals seeking to get certified. Of the four commercial certification outfits, one is being sued for deceptive pricing and has racked up hundreds of outraged consumer complaints. (See accompanying summary of other grief counseling training organizations and of two rigorous professional certification providers.) The credentialed cat experiment – and most recently, my own experience – underscore that certification for grief practitioners needs improvement. The mental health field has always strived to become as credible and respected as regular health care, and the concept of certifications and credentials, in fact, comes from medicine. You can ask a surgeon for his track records of successful operations, or a gastroenterologist about his rate of successful colonoscopies. But how do you apply this level of rigor to a profession often characterized by subjectivity? How do you make sure counselors in general are skilled and reputable? Certification attempts to address these questions, and not all the training is questionable, of course. The American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP), for example, issues well-regarded certifications that involve extensive work and prerequisites. Without an oversight agency, many look to the American Psychological Association as a gatekeeper. The APA has a section of its website called “Approved Sponsors of Continuing Education” – CE providers the association recognizes as trustworthy and professional. Udemy is not on it. Neither are the Global Grief Institute or the Grief Recovery Institute. But PESI is, and you can click through to its listing of classes and webinars. APA’s list is theoretically only relevant for psychologists. However, the APA does approve sponsors of CE courses created by laypeople if they meet its lengthy standards and criteria for CE content. The APA’s seal is widely seen as a stamp of approval – and PESI, for example, advertises the APA seal on its own website. Perhaps it’s not necessary to have a professional background to be an effective grief coach or peer counselor.  Many people who want to enter the field mention that they have experienced grievous losses of their own that motivate them to help other people in their suffering. There is also a growing movement of people with lived experience with mental illness and recovery who want to use their experiences to help others. Peer support specialists are even eligible to be paid for their work with funds from the federal Medicaid system – if they have completed training and certification programs sanctioned by each state. So what’s the harm in the lack of strict national standards in the grief counseling industry? To begin with, peers and others who want to work with people who are grieving deserve the best possible training. At present,  professionals and non-professionals alike may pay for continuing education that isn’t optimal or even scientifically valid.  More importantly, patients dealing with profound grief could find themselves working with people who have no real training – beyond an easily passed on-line course. Jolene Formaini, a retired nurse who ran a bereavement program for a Pennsylvania hospice, recalls the story of a mother grieving over the death of her college-aged daughter. She sought help from a woman who billed herself as a “certified”  grief counselor but had no clinical training. When Mother’s Day came, her counselor sent her flowers and a card signed with her daughter’s name. “She was crushed,” says Formaini. For this mother, it felt like going back to square one in her grieving process. “There is no course in the world that would say that’s okay,” says Formaini. She believes marketing oneself as a certified grief counselor despite not completing any appropriate program is “dangerous.” Licenses and board certifications, at least, give patients an avenue to complain. Psychologists certified by the ABPP can lose their certification if sanctioned by the licensing board or even have their license revoked. An unlicensed counselor, therapist, coach or professional who’s been handed bogus credentials isn’t held to a set of minimum standards. “If somebody just calls themselves a grief counselor and they give you bad advice, there’s no profession for you to appeal to. No one regulates their behavior,” said Gregory Neimeyer, the APA’s associate executive director for professional development and continuing education. And gatekeepers are hard to find: Counseling and psychology have become increasingly specialized and universities don’t have the resources to provide hyper-specific training. States don’t want to halt innovation since they can’t keep up in creating specialized licenses for each new, potentially effective therapy. National boards and associations are shackled by lack of time and resources. That means people needing help with their grief may face unexpected hazards, experts say. “We want to raise the awareness of the public that you should be careful when somebody says they’re certified, to make sure that they’re certified by something that’s bona fide within the profession,” said Washburn. Kathy Richardson, a licensed counselor and assistant professor at Rosemont College, advises patients to ask grief practitioners about their educational background and training before committing: “Where were they trained? What’s their educational background? Did they just get a Black Friday deal or 50% off a workshop and they went ‘now I’m a world renowned grief specialist?’” Richardson’s words were ringing in my ears as I opened a new tab. A quick internet search on “How to get a certification in grief counseling” displayed an attractive offering: a certification with “a minimum of 6 hours of continuing education in specific grief counseling topics.” I clicked on the link. It led me to Evergreen Certifications, a private company that provides certifications in behavioral health, healthcare, speech-language, physical therapy, occupational therapy and education. I emailed the company, identified myself as a journalist, requested an interview and got an automated acknowledgment – but no further reply or interview opportunity. I continued my research. Of the four grief recovery courses approved by Evergreen, two were available through PESI, a leader in healthcare continuing education. PESI markets mostly to health care professionals, but it also allows non-professionals (in categories such as ‘parent/guardian’) to take various courses. Unlike other continuing education providers, PESI doesn’t give out certifications. It provides the training and credits required to qualify for certifications from Evergreen and others. I thought PESI and Evergreen were separate entities, but court and tax records show that PESI actually owns Evergreen, which was founded in 2017. To my knowledge, this hasn’t been advertised by either organization. (For more on PESI’s internal financial workings, see here). “We don’t hide the fact that [Evergreen is] part of PESI, but we don’t feel the need to also advertise it because it does sit as its own entity,” PESI’s deputy director Michael Olson said in an interview. “Evergreen standards will honor education from any provider that meets the standards.” The cost for PESI’s Grief Treatment Certification Training course was $219.99 for a $439.97 value, according to its website. I wasn’t especially lucky to get this deal since the online course has almost always been on sale. Since enrolling in PESI’s certification program a year ago, I have received 808 promotional emails for various courses, seminars and workshops – more than two a day on average. Anything is fertile ground for massive discounts: summer sales, Memorial Day sales, spring sales, St. Patrick’s Day sales, and Valentine’s Day sales. The completion of PESI’s Grief Treatment Certification Training relied on self-monitored attendance records and a multiple-choice quiz. This was the test I was able to pass on that Sunday afternoon of bread-baking, with a certificate of completion available to download soon afterward. But could I finally advertise myself as a certified grief and bereavement practitioner? This was still unclear. The documents I received from PESI and Udemy were indeed certificates, but they did not mention “certification.” This distinction is confusing but critical. My certificates – also called certificates of successful completion – are proof that I attended and completed a course. That paves the way for students to apply for certification, which allows you to add a multitude of letters after your name: CGP for instance (Certified Grief Professional). In fact, several of my fellow Udemy classmates had already posted various diploma-like certificates to the “Licenses and Certifications” section of their LinkedIn profiles. Some of them were mental health professionals; others were not. I noticed a similar trend scrolling through the forum page of the PESI course I took. The drop-down list of professions upon signing up included non-professional occupations such as “teacher,” “school administration,” “physical therapist,” “audiologist,” “massage therapist,” “coder,” “attorney,” and even “HR professional.” I was uncertain how to identify myself since the multiple-choice boxes included no category for journalist, so I initially checked the first one: “Counselor,” then changed to “parent/guardian” since that was the closest I could find to my situation. When  I called  Evergreen to find out why I had never been issued a certification,  a customer service representative explained that I had to be a licensed mental health professional.  That’s not what PESI’s director Michael Olson told me, however.  He said in an interview that the certification would be different than a mental health professional’s, but that non-professionals are eligible to get certified if they pass the test. Either way, I had another option now. The Grief and Bereavement Counselling course offered by Udemy is accredited by the International Association of Therapists (IAOTH), an organization based in the U.K. I promptly signed up for a membership, adding both my Udemy certificate and the PESI one to the qualifications section. And today – voilà – here I am: listed on the association’s website and ostensibly available for hire. – Rappler.com Astrid Landon is an audio reporter, editor and producer working in Paris, Madrid and the United States.

The total number of devices shipped was 286 million, down from 329 million in 2022. That meant total 2022 sales volume was the lowest since 2013 and the first time since then that annual sales have dropped below 300 million, IDC said in a report. Android handset maker Vivo was the top-selling brand over the year, with a market share of 18.6%. Its total shipments fell 25.1% year-on-year, however. Honor ranked as the second best-selling brand, with shipments growing more than 34%, albeit from a low base. Apple Inc was the third best-selling phone brand in 2022, tied with Oppo. Apple’s overall sales fell 4.4% year-on-year, broadly outperforming the market downturn. In Q4, despite being the top-selling brand in the three-month period, year-on-year sales for iPhones were still down, as supply chain issues caused by worker unrest at manufacturer Foxconn’s plant in the city of Zhengzhou compounded worse-than expected demand, researchers wrote. Strict COVID-19 controls in China, which ramped up in the spring of 2022 across several cities, weighed heavily on its economy which slumped to one of its worst levels in nearly half a century last year. The plunge in smartphone sales in China reflected the sector’s performance globally.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/innovations/united-states-european-union-launch-artificial-intelligence-agreement/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – The United States and European Union on Friday, January 27, announced an agreement to speed up and enhance the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve agriculture, healthcare, emergency response, climate forecasting, and the electric grid. A senior US administration official, discussing the initiative shortly before the official announcement, called it the first sweeping AI agreement between the United States and Europe. Previously, agreements on the issue had been limited to specific areas such as enhancing privacy, the official said. AI modeling, which refers to machine-learning algorithms that use data to make logical decisions, could be used to improve the speed and efficiency of government operations and services. “The magic here is in building joint models (while) leaving data where it is,” the senior administration official said. “The US data stays in the US and European data stays there, but we can build a model that talks to the European and the US data because the more data and the more diverse data, the better the model.” The initiative will give governments greater access to more detailed and data-rich AI models, leading to more efficient emergency responses and electric grid management, and other benefits, the administration official said. Pointing to the electric grid, the official said the United States collects data on how electricity is being used, where it is generated, and how to balance the grid’s load so that weather changes do not knock it offline. Many European countries have similar data points they gather relating to their own grids, the official said. Under the new partnership all of that data would be harnessed into a common AI model that would produce better results for emergency managers, grid operators and others relying on AI to improve systems. The partnership is currently between just the White House and the European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-member European Union. The senior administration official said other countries will be invited to join in the coming months. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/belarusian-aryna-sabalenka-crowned-first-neutral-grand-slam-champion-2023-australian-open/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – With daring resolve and a thunderous forehand, Aryna Sabalenka rose above geopolitical tumult to become the first player to claim a Grand Slam title as a neutral at the Australian Open. The big-hitting Belarusian overhauled Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, in the final at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday, January 28, while barred from representing the eastern European nation. Russian and Belarusian players are effectively “stateless” on the ATP and WTA tours, competing as individuals without national affiliation due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Had Rybakina not switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018, the Russia-born player would also have competed as a neutral. Perhaps for the first time ever at Rod Laver Arena, the championship match was played without fans waving the national flag of the winner in the terraces. Deemed a disruption by organizers, fans were banned from bringing Russian and Belarusian flags to Melbourne Park on the second day of the tournament after a complaint from the Ukraine embassy in Australia. Sabalenka will not have “Belarus” next to her name on the winner’s trophy, the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. They may have seemed mere details as the 24-year-old joyously celebrated with her team in the players’ box and sipped on a glass of champagne at her post-match media conference. But her mood darkened slightly when asked whether being a neutral player had taken something away from her triumph. “I think everyone still knows that I’m Belarusian player. That’s it,” she told reporters flatly. Sabalenka and other Belarusian and Russian players were banned from Wimbledon last year, a polarizing decision that triggered heavy fines from the men’s ATP and women’s WTA tours and also saw the Grand Slam’s ranking points taken away. With the conflict in Ukraine raging on, Wimbledon will soon need to decide whether the player ban should remain in place. Asked whether missing Wimbledon made her Australian Open win sweeter, Sabalenka was non-committal. “I mean, missing the Wimbledon was really tough for me. It was a tough moment for me,” she said. “But I mean, I played the US Open after. It’s not about Wimbledon right now. It’s just about the hard work I’ve done.” The Belarus tennis federation was quick to extend congratulations to the country’s second tennis player to win a Grand Slam, following on from twice Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who was knocked out in the semifinals. Sabalenka thought people in Belarus would be proud of her but she had no plans to celebrate with them in the short term. “I think I will go back to Miami. I live there right now,” she said. – Rappler.com"

Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on $250 million bond since pleading not guilty to charges of fraud in the looting of billions of dollars from the now-bankrupt FTX. Prosecutors said their request was in response to Bankman-Fried’s recent effort to contact a potential witness against him, the general counsel of an FTX affiliate, and was needed to prevent witness tampering and other obstruction of justice. But in a letter to US District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers said prosecutors sprung the “overbroad” bail conditions without revealing that both sides had been discussing bail over the last week. “Rather than wait for any response from the defense, the government sandbagged the process, filing this letter at 6:00 p.m. on Friday evening,” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers wrote. “The government apparently believes that a one-sided presentation – spun to put our client in the worst possible light – is the best way to get the outcome it seeks.” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers also said their client’s efforts to contact the general counsel and John Ray, installed as FTX’s chief executive during the bankruptcy, were attempts to offer “assistance” and not to interfere. A spokesman for US Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan declined to comment. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers proposed that their client have access to some colleagues, including his therapist, but not be allowed to talk with Caroline Ellison and Zixiao “Gary” Wang, who have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. They said a Signal ban isn’t necessary because Bankman-Fried is not using the auto-delete feature, and concern he might is “unfounded.” The lawyers also asked to remove a bail condition preventing Bankman-Fried from accessing FTX, Alameda or cryptocurrency assets, saying there was “no evidence” he was responsible for earlier alleged unauthorized transactions. In an order on Saturday, Kaplan gave prosecutors until Monday to address Bankman-Fried’s concerns. “The court expects all counsel to abstain from pejorative characterizations of the actions and motives of their adversaries,” the judge added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-rules-out-talks-with-japan-fishing-near-disputed-islands/,[],"Russia said on Sunday, January 29, it will not hold annual talks with Japan on renewing a pact that allows Japanese fishermen to operate near disputed islands, saying Japan has taken anti-Russian measures. The islands, off the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, are known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories and have been at the core of decades of tension between the neighbors. “In the context of the anti-Russian measures taken by the Japanese government… the Russian side informed Tokyo that it could not agree on the holding of intergovernmental consultations on the implementation of this agreement,” the RIA state news agency reported, citing Russia’s foreign ministry. Japan, a major US ally, imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian individuals and organizations soon after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year. On Friday, it tightened sanctions on Russia in response to Russian air attacks on Ukrainian cities. Russia in June suspended the 1998 agreement that allowed Japanese boats to fish near the islands and Japan’s chief cabinet secretary on Monday told a news conference that Japan would demand that Russia engages in the annual talks so this year’s fishing operations could begin. But the Russian ministry said there would be no improvement in ties unless Japan showed “respect.” “To return to a normal dialogue, the Japanese neighbours should show elementary respect for our country, a desire to improve bilateral relations,” the ministry said, according to the RIA news agency.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians-cast-lance-reddick-zeus-toby-stephens-poseidon/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians has cast two of its most important Greek Gods, author Rick Riordan announced on Friday, January 27. Toby Stephens (Black Sails, Lost in Space) will take on the role of the sea god Poseidon, while Lance Reddick (Bosch, John Wick) will play the king of Olympus Zeus. “We heard your calls all the way from Olympus. Welcome to Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” the show’s social media accounts said, alongside a photo of Stephens and Reddick with Walker Scobell, who will play titular character Percy Jackson. On his website, Riordan shared that Stephens and Reddick serve as the last final casting announcements for the first season, as they are the “last major characters to appear in the season” – which makes sense since the two Greek Gods only appear at the end of The Lightning Thief book. The author also praised both actors for their “godly aura.” “Not many actors have the sheer power to stand toe-to-toe with one another and convince you they are the manifestations of the sky and the sea, about [to] tear one another apart,” he said. Riordan added that Reddick has an “aura of authority and power that makes him perfect for the king of Olympus,” while describing Stephen’s Poseidon as “incredible on-screen.” “When (Stephens) delivered some of Poseidon’s iconic lines, I got chills. And seeing him and Walker together, you can absolutely believe they are father and son,” he wrote. Riordan also updated fans that they’re done with “almost all photography” for the eight episodes and the team is wrapping up filming in Vancouver, Canada with a “sense of pride and accomplishment.” He, however, reminded fans that they still have “months and months of post-production work to do.” The series started filming in June 2022 and Disney has yet to announce a release date for the series. Percy Jackson and the Olympians also stars Leah Sava Jeffries and Aryan Simhadri as Annabeth Chase and Grover Underwood, respectively. Other cast members include Virginia Kull, Jason Mantzoukas, Megan Mullally, Glynn Turman, Timm Sharp, and Lin Manuel-Miranda. Olympians series revolves around young Percy Jackson, the half-human, half-god son of Poseidon who is first sent to Camp Half-Blood. The first two books of the series were previously adapted into films, The Lightning Thief in 2011 and Sea of Monsters in 2013. It starred Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson, Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth, and Brandon T. Jackson as Grover, but the films received mixed reviews from critics and the fanbase. Riordan, meanwhile, had nothing but good words for how promising the upcoming series adaptation would be: “If you’re a fan of the books or even just a good adventure, you are going to love the show.” 
He also hinted that they’re looking forward to a “not-yet-greenlit-but-fully-anticipated” renewal for a second season. – Rappler.com"

Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, I have a strange question. I recently found out that my boyfriend had hooked up with his first cousin in the past. He doesn’t think it’s a big deal and thinks that I’m weird for being uncomfortable about it, especially since it happened before we met. I keep trying to make him understand that it’s not the hooking up part but the incest aspect that makes me uncomfortable, but he doesn’t get it. How do I make him understand the difference? Thank you very much. Sincerely,
Not a Fan of Incest ————————— Dear Not a Fan of Incest (NFI), Thank you for your message. Relationships between cousins spark diametrically opposed views around the world. For example, cousin marriage is illegal in countries such as China, Taiwan, both Koreas, many US states, and of course the Philippines. By contrast, a high percentage of marriages in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and some other Middle Eastern and African countries are reportedly between first or second cousins, though statistics are incomplete. Culture, religion, and economics, particularly protection of family wealth, play their part in this disparity of approach. While the above sheds some light on the frequency and acceptability of cousin marriage, it is silent as to extramarital cousin relationships, though it is likely that these are more frequent than actual marriages. Again, there are laws against such liaisons in some countries, but generally legislation is reserved for cases involving minors, coercion, undue influence, and such. While I am very happy to be corrected, I have found no Philippine law that prohibits sexual relationships between fully consenting adult cousins. Turning to your particular situation, you and your boyfriend (let’s call him Diego) mirror this disparity. You are concerned about the incest and not so worried by the hookup, while he sees no problem with the familial connection and dismisses the hookup as ancient history. Interestingly, you suggest that the solution lies in Diego accepting your argument, not you accepting his. Prohibition of cousin incest has traditionally relied on cultural, religious, and medical grounds. Regarding culture, the question whether precolonial Filipino attitudes to cousin relationships were supported or subverted by the Spanish and American imposition of their own value systems falls outside the purview of this column. However, when it comes to religion, the very diversity of views on the subject suggests that if there is a supreme being, he/she/it is rather inconsistent. The Hebrew Bible has many instances of cousin marriage, Islam does not oppose it, Catholics have at different times allowed it and then prohibited it (while allowing dispensations). What is known medically from countless studies is that children born of cousins have a higher exposure to genetic disorders. Historically this has been a significant factor militating against cousin relationships. Now, however, with enhanced birth control, pregnancy can be avoided and thus a major argument against these relationships falls by the wayside. NFI, you do not explain on what grounds you have such strong feelings about incest, but it seems that unlikely that any of the above should trigger such a response. Possibly it is just a stance that, like many others, you have inherited and never needed to question. If however there is some related trauma in your or your family’s past, that needs addressing. Finally, we mentioned earlier how you expect Diego to adjust to your view rather than vice versa. On the narrow issue of incest, perhaps you need to consider whether his view does in fact have merit, given the hookup nature of the relationship, which is after all between consenting adults who hopefully practice birth control. The wider issue is what your approach says about your general relationship with Diego. Is this the only time when you have simply expected him to change his view to accommodate yours? If so, that’s fine; if not, perhaps you need to consider what implications it has for the longer term health of your relationship. All the best,
JAFBaer Dear NFI: Thank you very much for your letter. In the interest of full disclosure, I find Mr. Baer’s answer is highly commendable, answering your letter directly and also supplementing it with a broader perspective. I also agree with all he says. However, I have experienced that many Filipinos have a gut-level reaction against any kind of incest, so I can understand your discomfort. There are some theories that support this seemingly instinctive aversion to incest. One is the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis (nature); the other the incest taboo (nurture). Diego’s relationship with his cousin shows that neither the incest taboo (mainly focused on how we do not feel sexual attraction for people we grew up with, such as siblings and close cousins) nor inbreeding avoidance (circumvented by birth control) are applicable to the situation you describe. There are several articles to help you understand why some people might have a subjective aversion to incestuous sexual relationships;  to me, the best one is Robert Paul’s “Incest avoidance: oedipal and preoedipal, natural and cultural,” published (2010) in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Society. An abstract is available, but the whole article is worth reading should this issue mean as much to you as it did before you wrote your letter. Please write us again, NFI, if you want to explore this (or, indeed, any other topic) further. It is not easy to do a volte face about something you have held dear (even if unconsciously) all your life. All the best,
MG Holmes – Rappler.com Please send any comments, questions, or requests for advice to twopronged@rappler.com."
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/cat-person-review-stressful-look-modern-dating-follies/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"Cat Person, the 2017 short story by Kristen Roupenian published in The New Yorker, delves deep into the uneasiness and paranoia that arise when determining whether a guy you’re dating is nice or a murderer. It deals with unspoken power dynamics, the inability to communicate, and the realization that someone may not actually be as good as you expected. On the other hand, Cat Person, the film, imagines the modern dating scene as a delicate dance. Each step from both parties can be like defusing a ticking time bomb. One misstep and the fragile balance may be shattered, unleashing boundless chaos and turmoil. Though, maybe a bit too much chaos in this version. Needless to say, this was a nerve-wracking watch. It’s messy, but you can’t take your eyes away. Its closest comparison is Promising Young Woman, but imagine if that film had escalated its final act — which was already bad — into a fiery action-thriller. Not just that, it also slides into various genres like horror, comedy, and espionage, sacrificing a natural and organic feel in the process. It’s a lot happening at once, saved only by its performances from two up-and-coming actors. The film follows Margot (Emilia Jones), a young college student who works at a movie theater chain, and Robert (Nicholas Braun), an older and peculiar guy who has an affinity for nerdy stuff. It’s a constant push and pull between Margot and Robert, both trying to stake their claim as the more dominant one, the nicer one, or the more reasonable one. Braun is perfect as Robert. His towering presence is offset by his endearing awkwardness, making him the ideal Rorschach test in that people can’t quite decide if he’s a serial killer or a genuinely kind soul. Jones, fresh off the Best Picture-winning CODA, is assured and actually the anchor for most of the film’s genre shifts. It’s easy to sympathize with her, and she carries a lot of emotional weight, especially in surprisingly tense moments. They have competing influences coloring their ideas on love and what an ideal partner should be. Margot is constantly mentored by her feminist friend, Taylor (Geraldine Viswanathan), who is constantly on internet boards in defense of women’s rights, sometimes going too far in her embittered battle against men. Robert is consumed by his consumption of pop culture masculinity, particularly in Harrison Ford films. “A lot of what he’s caught up in is different ideas of masculinity,” director Susanna Fogel shares. ”Some of them are competing with each other, but that culture has told him what he should be.” All of this comes to a head in the penultimate sex scene, which unravels from the perspective of Margot, who undergoes a self-dialogue rationalizing her decision to commit to the act, her subsequent regret, and her inability to tell Robert what she truly feels. In an interview, Jones gives insight into her position on its lead characters: “No one’s the bad guy in this situation. You can’t really say, ‘Oh, she should’ve said no,’ or ‘He should’ve checked,’ or ‘He should’ve this, that, and that,’ it’s just two people that are having two completely different versions of the same moment and they just don’t know how to communicate.” The film makes you feel overlapping emotions at once, unsure of who to side with or who to root for. Each character makes questionable decisions that lead to disastrous, even comically bleak, situations. The most intense emotions come at moments when the misunderstanding is crystal clear, so as a viewer, you’re screaming at them to explain things properly. That can be a good thing, but also an extremely bad thing, since the film feels like it has lost its hand in navigating its own complexity. There’s a scene when Margot jokes about Robert being a murderer as a way to cope with her anxious thoughts. Robert, likely feeling like he needs to deflate the tension, doubles down on the murderer bit, only to make Margot probably more uncomfortable and doubt his character even more. This is the cycle of their relationship, a series of misunderstandings that lead to self-fulfilling prophecies that could’ve been avoided. What makes Fogel’s adaptation a lot more different than Roupenian’s short story is that while both deal with how a younger girl and older guy obviously misalign, the film operates in the pockets of grey that are entrenched in a story that is, to its core, a portrait of how politics and culture influence love in the contemporary era. Cat Person literally begins with soundbites from a film echoing in the hallways of a movie theater. At one point, Margot and her mom perform a Marilyn Monroe song that the former was initially reluctant to do due to its conservative undertones. Reddit and online communities play a huge part in influencing how Taylor views men and her personal principles. And if it weren’t obvious enough, there are Star Wars collector items scattered across Robert’s house. All of these are the indirect yet unwavering forces of cultural norms shaping our perceptions and beliefs, and they have taken relationships as their prey. Does this exonerate Robert’s weirdness and creepy remarks? No. Does this excuse Margot’s aversion from being candid with him? Not in the slightest. But what it does showcase is the interplay of societal norms and cultural products working behind the scenes to prevent the two from lying flat with their bellies out and being truly comfortable with each other. They are communicating via their ideas of each other, not with who they really are. However, in the way the film plays out, those disparate elements of culture, while promising, fail to coalesce seamlessly. Because of these ingredients, I anticipate Cat Person will engender a schism between opposing factions, each justifying how their chosen protagonist is actually in the right or wrong. This is akin to the divide that emerged when 500 Days of Summer was released (coincidentally, also a Sundance film), with fervent supporters of both Summer and Tom eventually clashing on the internet streets. In a similar vein to the narrative that birthed it, Cat Person is poised to become a lightning rod for discussions surrounding the intricacies of dating and the difficulties of being a woman, a man, or simply someone seeking love. Honesty plays a huge role in the film, mainly how this generation seems to have lost that word in the dictionary. But because of its new additions, like the wild ending and uneven genre-blending, the film’s message can get lost in the shuffle. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/infinity-pool-review-bold-takedown-wealthy-debauchery/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"This is a spoiler-free review. Brandon Cronenberg, son of famed sci-fi body horror master David Cronenberg, shares his father’s fascination with the dark depths of the human condition. Just last year, the older Cronenberg imagined a trippy, squirm-inducing dystopia (or utopia?) wherein surgery and self-mutilation become the new hot commodities of art in Crimes of the Future. It’s a striking piece of work that sees the visionary go back to familiar themes of artistic obsession and eroticized danger, frequently with protagonists flying too close to the sun (see The Fly, Videodrome, and Crash). In Infinity Pool, Brandon Cronenberg confirms that their family household is filled to the brim with philosophy books. He commits to hedonist thought experiments and ethical dilemmas about cloning and personal identity in a horror film that packs a satirical punch. Like in his previous work (the identity-swapping Possessor and the satirical Antiviral), the younger Cronenberg is different in that he places his dystopian sci-fi horror in the present, finding contradictions in 21st century affairs that feel engaging, if not a little bit weird. The married pair of James (Alexander Skarsgård) and Em (Cleopatra Coleman) visit Li Tolqa, a dreamy beach paradise that combines Croatia and Hungary. The locals are angry at the rich tourists for roaming their land, but they can’t do anything about it. It’s not long before the couple meets Gabi (Mia Goth) and her spouse Alban (Jalil Lespert). They extend an invitation for a getaway trip that’ll change them or, worse, corrupt them. Cronenberg does two things here: first, he introduces a White Lotus-like concept, a paradise world of breathtaking sunsets and soothing waveslapping against the hull of a floating resort. Second, he quickly turns all of that around and creates a hallucinogenic freight train that goes to bizarre places. Following a whirlwind of events resulting in a crime swept under the rug, James and Gabi begin a journey into an anarcho-capitalist world that rewards insanity and punishes sanity. The best part? It’s a takedown of the rich and how psychopathic they can tend to be. Mia Goth, coming off the heels of Pearl and X, gives an unhinged, full-throttle, and subtly funny performance. She plays a seductress, a perfect dream girl for any vain and self-absorbed person. This is where Alexander Skarsgård’s (The Northman) James enters, a failed writer who is immediately entranced by the thought of someone actually reading and liking his book. His financial standing does not match that of his wife, Em, who holds great wealth and backing from her father. This situation makes James’ actions obvious, and the film pokes fun at his narcissism. Karim Hussain’s cinematography is eerie and hypnotic. At times, the camera gracefully rotates the frame, creating an illusion of defying gravity’s pull. Hussain also puts a premium on extreme close-ups, often cropping specific body parts in such uncomfortable positions. I watched the NC-17 version at the Sundance Film Festival (which, unfortunately, will not be available on release), and there are scenes that go the extra mile, completely shocking me with how ballsy (pun intended) the film is in how far it stretches the taboo. The sensual scenes are shot unconventionally, with strobing lights and colorful mosaics of bodies engaged in carnality. To say that the visuals in these moments are visually arresting would be an understatement. They are as dizzying as soaring through the clouds on a magic-mushroom-fueled rollercoaster, except you realize you’re galloping on a leopard’s back in the bowels of a forest so dark and wide. In a way, the film hides that forest of debauchery and decadence through its eye-candy visuals and eroticism. Then, there’s the film’s chief philosophical concern: the removal of any accountability or consequence brought about by the advent of cloning. It’s an interesting subject that Cronenberg skillfully weaves into a setting that contains a conspicuous military and police presence. In essence, cloning becomes a tool for the wealthy to indulge in their every whim, untainted by the weight of consequences. James, with his twisted grin and bloodcurdling screams, takes pleasure in the brutal suffering that his clones endure. By making James the point-of-view character, the film asks us to confront the spectacle of torture and its connection to unchecked power and privilege. In a sequence that evokes the uneasiness of A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut, James and Gabi’s band of misfits don grotesque masks that symbolize fear and derangement. Each mask unearths the true faces of these people, revealing the darkness that lies beneath their facade of normalcy. Interestingly, Li Tolqa and its government seem to welcome this behavior. The industry of tourism is an important sector, and so the country bends over backward to cater to the viciousness of its visiting guests. While the locals may find solace in the clones of these tourists, through which they can direct their ire, it is a small reprieve in the face of such moral corruption. But even without these philosophical subtexts, anyone (with an open mind) can enjoy Infinity Pool as a unique feast for the senses. What can be lost in the fold is how entertaining it is to see Alexander Skarsgård’s descent into madness and Mia Goth’s electrifying demeanor. It’s a joy to watch if you can stomach it. But as I say that, I realize that perhaps even I, too, may find a perverted sense of enjoyment in the depraved. James, though relishing in not being a clone himself (or is he?), ensnares the audience with a mirror, challenging them to consider if they, too, would find themselves in a similar predicament. Whether we care to admit it or not, that mirror reminds us we are not so different from these characters in more ways than we can ever imagine. That’s the true terror of Infinity Pool. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-davos-disconnect-marcos/,[],"Compared to the amount of criticism leveled against the Marcos administration on the size of its entourage to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the relevance, utility, and purpose of the Davos affair for the public back home, and what must have been the exponential cost burdened on taxpayers, given the number of the delegation relative to those from other by far economically better-off nations, positive news on this latest foreign sortie is scarce. And that is because there is really very little transparency provided to the public. The only official statement prior to the Davos sortie was that the contentious Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), which the Senate has yet to deliberate on, was to be presented to the WEF. The most that the public can deduct from that tiny tidbit is that whatever would be presented would be raw and tentative. That carries with it the relatively positive assumption that the current Senate is an independent body, that it is not a “rubber stamp.” Absent such positivity, should the MIF be railroaded, then we might as well dismiss any notion of checks and balances, given the amount of criticism the MIF has generated from various concerned sectors wary of forcibly funneled funds where no surpluses exist, the most toxic of which is the fear of a money laundering gambit to cleanse long plundered, albeit undiscovered, wealth. Because of the lack of transparency and trust issues, the public is compelled to speculate on the Marcos administration’s motivations. Unfortunately, doing so adds unhealthy and unproductive uncertainty that worsens when it arrays our poverty-ridden reality against Swiss extravagance – a diametric disconnect from the necessary surplus and plenty that are prerequisites when nations establish sovereign funds such as the MIF. Already social media is aflame, and both scathing speculation and disinformation are having a heyday. Not only is the remnant credibility of the Marcos administration being torched, but the roasting is also being applied to those who’ve hitched a ride on the Davos bandwagon. Note the handful of A-listers whose combined billions trump the finances of over 55 million Filipinos. The brickbats range from the petty to the sinister. It began with social media posts that scheduled flights were commandeered to accommodate our unusually large Davos delegation. Allusions, both ominous and satirical, resurrected painful memories of secret Swiss bank accounts and money laundering. While the diverted flights narrative was patently false, its absurdity ignited a conflagration that included the prohibitively high costs of extravagance burdened on taxpayers, who foot the bill for an oligarchy well-accustomed to finer trappings that the Filipino public can only dream of. The ridiculous official retort is that the benefits will exceed those costs. That assumes an accounting will be made. Note that the economy still continues to pay for the costs of plunder and money laundered half a century ago. In an economy where rice, sugar, salt, onions, and eggs, all within the typical household food basket and measured by our consumer price index, are priced like luxury goods, the gilded symbolisms of Davos are disconnected from the ordinary Filipinos unrepresented in the Davos bandwagon. Randomly ask 10 people about Davos. For the 49% wallowing in domestic squalor who rate themselves poor, Davos is a colossal extravagant disconnect, including the brazen Davos soundbite now reverberating, where there was a declaration that the post-dictatorship years were our darkest periods. Such highlights the ascension of lies to the global stage. Brazen disconnects from established truth are unfortunate given the theme of the WEF for 2023 – “Cooperation in a Fragmented World.” Allow us a skinny listing of latent WEF themes disconnected from our festering Philippine reality, each debunking one online tabloid that bannered us the “darling” of Davos. First of all, the WEF is a forum to address global issues and learn best practices in leadership. That second objective is extremely important in our case. Marcos declared in Davos that he entered politics to regain power and cleanse his family’s tarnished reputation. As for leadership, simply look at the performance, productivity, and competence, or its utter absence, at the Department of Agriculture, which has been endowed with the powers of the presidency. Again, the WEF theme is “Cooperation in a Fragmented World.” Our specific concern in that area is our relationship with Communist China, who not only claims part of our exclusive territory but uses its military might to forcibly prevent us from benefiting from our marine resources. Let us go through each of the foregoing. The backdrops of the WEF 2023 that are likewise thematic, in that they require competent leadership and our full attention, includes rising interest rates and costs of living, a debilitating energy crunch, and an impending global recession. Our monetary leaders have been aggressively increasing key policy rates. That is zombie economics. It addresses demand-pull inflation. Our inflation is cost-push and not demand-driven. Note that our food inflation is highest among the region due to incompetent food and agriculture management, where our constant pandering to trader’s interests fails to alleviate the continuing plight of a population dependent on agriculture and now paying the world’s highest prices for kitchen table basics. How indeed can a policy of default importations support local food production? As for the energy crunch, we remain with one of the highest electricity tariffs in Asia yet are constantly threatened by inadequate baseload supply. If this is our reality, then how are we the ‘’Darling of Davos?” – Rappler.com Dean de la Paz is a former investment banker and managing director of a New Jersey-based power company operating in the Philippines.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-the-promise-of-technology-is-the-promise-of-people/,[],"I would like for you to imagine the promise of technology. Facebook promises to be the gateway to your friends and family, ridesharing and delivery apps efficiency and connection against the grueling commute, your internet service provider cutting-edge reliability and speed. Sometimes, they even give you the promise of the world. When we strip away the allure of technology, what are we left with? A world of disconnect fueled by antagonism and shock that is filtered by content moderators, a non-solution to a systemic transportation crisis that leave us stories of drivers exploited, and aggravated calls on your internet plan. You haven’t quite been given the world — you can’t even connect to your meeting. I would like for you to imagine who is behind technology. These promises, delivered or not, are given to us by tech CEOs and eagerly embraced across the world. We hunger for solutions to age-old problems from communication, transportation, news, education, energy, and love — and are eager to receive engineered solutions to these. In turn, those wielding technology offer endless streams to support new entrepreneurs, startups, and products to move us towards wealth and prosperity, each one supposedly more innovative than the last. Our lives continuously cede to these platforms: our memories live in Facebook albums or the cloud, the rise and fall of political movements can be witnessed online — sometimes excusing us from on-the-grounds participation, developments in artificial intelligence offer us quicker answers, and we favor the simplicity offered a tap away. A hyper-efficient world aided by machines seems to solve society’s ills, until it becomes a sickness in itself. In truth, our technological futures are built atop of obscured human labor. A phenomenon termed as “ghost work” by anthropologist Mary L. Gray refers to “work performed by a human which a customer believes is being performed by an automated process.” Take ChatGPT, a general-purpose chatbot released in November 2022 that provides text responses near-instantaneously. It can help you with anything: writing emails, synthesizing data, or even programming itself. No machine thinks for itself. Models like ChatGPT are only able to impress us because they build on the breadth of human work, and thus carry the constraints and failures that accompany it. This begins a questioning of this “breadth” in the first place: who designs these models (and their intent), the data these models are trained on, and how this data is classified — of which all steps involve humans. Widely lauded, universities are rushing to find solutions to potential cheating aided by ChatGPT. College-educated workers, even programmers themselves, begin to worry about employment as their labor seems increasingly replaceable by machines, even if it’s just new labor under the hood that we’re bending towards. ChatGPT’s success can largely be attributed to its palatability. While chatbots are not new, the lack of obscenity and profanity in one is. Human input is present at every step of design. The best and worst of humanity is fed into language models (hence the previous issues with obscenity and extremism). Human-aided supervision and reinforcement learning guide these model’s outputs. To ensure ChatGPT was unlike its predecessors, OpenAI recruited an outsourcing firm in Kenya to help design a safer model. The process? To have these outsourced workers manually label examples of profanity, violence, and hate speech to be filtered out, in exchange for pay about $2 (P108) an hour. This is not a far cry. The Global South has long endured these roles, becoming the invisible army that powers every impressive technology. Take Facebook for instance, ubiquitous enough that there are countries that understand it as the internet itself. A study conducted by Helani Galpaya showed that more respondents across several countries (including the Philippines) self-reported being “Facebook users” than “internet users.” Meanwhile, Filipino content moderators under intensely-surveilled working conditions screen reports, exposing themselves to graphic sexual content, violence, and extremism on a daily basis. It is incredibly dehumanizing, mentally taxing work that many of us cannot fathom because we’ve never seen it. It is of our best interest to only see the light. It appears that those who gate the internet are often the most gated from the internet themselves. Millions of Filipinos enter Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), data-labeling, or content moderation jobs to support the technological infrastructure and rapid pace of “innovation.” Enticed with decent pay, often posted with little to no qualifications necessary, and done in recruitment hub hiring sprees, it’s hard to deny the opportunity to join the workforce and indulge in the industry’s economic promise. Silicon Valley startups (or even the Filipino “Sinigang Valley”) use the excuse of economic opportunity to justify remote outsourcing. Even those not literally invisible are devalued with this mindset. Underexploited laborers act as the on-demand service providers beneath the shiny interfaces on our phones: our food delivery drivers, content moderators that clean our TikTok feeds, and support staff. Technology is something that can be summoned and controlled, people cannot be — or shouldn’t be. After all, for technology to be consumable, it has to be palatable. Palatability involves shrouding the violent, intensive human labor needed to maintain technologies. This is why we are moved when we see the Facebook post of a delivery driver left to bear the brunt of canceled orders, wading through weather. Or with “older” technologies: how we turn a blind eye to ruthless production factories that power the fast fashion industry. It reminds us, for a brief moment, of the humanity in everything around us. Instead, companies continue to express technology as the stuff of magic. Perfectly cheap, efficient, and convenient. Then we are moved to hit checkout. Even Silicon Valley’s model of classically educated laborers are no longer safe themselves. Microsoft has begun talks to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, while at the same time announcing layoffs for 10,000 workers. They are joined by Google and Amazon among others, all companies previously touted to push the boundaries of innovation. As we head towards a global economic downturn, it appears that this at-will treatment previously reserved for the global south now spares no one. Tech workers, whether working as ride-share drivers, content moderators, or BS Computer Science-educated software engineers — must come together in solidarity with consumers against an industry that has historically erased its people. We need to call into question who the “technologists” that drive innovation are, especially when this innovation is at the expense of people. We need to recognize the breadth of forms that a technologist takes, and the truth that the massive forces of labor that write code, serve content, and protect us are continuously exploited. We need to know that maintaining a myopic view of the role of a “technologist” glorifies “technology” alone, detaching it from the human workforce that powers it. Without these laborers, these technologies would effectively be nothing. At the end of the day, technology is nothing but a tool. Technology is shaped by people, for people. I’m not discounting technology’s potential for economic empowerment; I disparage how technology has been used as an exploitative force rather than a transformative one. It is time to reclaim technology and look towards its potential for hope — where this act of reclamation begins with power placed on all tech workers rather than the few. I want a world where technology is used to put us in dialogue with one another, breaking down barriers instead of enacting more walls that hide us from one another. I want a world where machines don’t replace artists, but instead help more people make more art. I believe in a world where technology is a tool rather than the solution, where we have agency to use it as we please. I believe in a world where we think of people, first and foremost, not over-optimization and hyper-efficiency. I believe in a world where technology is a communal medium in which we can imagine better futures, where everyone is a technologist and engineer, not a tool wielded by the few. As technology is a tool, it is time for us to take it back. The truly magical part about technology is that it might be the most human thing about us. It is shaped by people, for people. – Rappler.com Chia Amisola is Product Designer based in San Francisco, California who graduated with a BA in Computing and the Arts from Yale University in 2022.

She also included some quote cards in the video such as, “I feel like you are the reward for everything I did right in my life,” and “My heart belongs to my boys,” as well as photos of her face and blood pressure measurements. Fellow celebrities such as Vina Morales, Marjorie Barretto, Melai Cantiveros, and Jed Madela, as well as Kris’ supporters have expressed their delight in seeing her current condition. In the comments, Kris disclosed that while she was bedridden after the trip, it was still worth it as it made her eldest son Josh really happy. She added that she would be having a medical checkup soon and asked the public to keep praying for her. Kris left for the United States in June 2022 to receive treatment for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), the rare disease she was diagnosed with in April. In September, she said that she was set to finally start immunosuppressant therapy. In December, she confirmed that she had been diagnosed with four autoimmune diseases, two of which are life-threatening, and “a highly likely fifth” disease. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/russia-council-of-mothers-and-wives-coda-story/,[],"When Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilization of reservists to bolster his war in Ukraine, thousands of people of fighting age fled the country. Protests broke out on the streets, and on the internet. For a brief moment, it appeared Russia might begin to see a unified anti-war movement. But just like at the start of the invasion, physical resistance to mobilization soon began to fade. Russian resistance to the war today is mostly an online operation, and Telegram has become its central platform. With Facebook and Instagram banned under an “extremism” law, and Russian social media giant VK under almost direct control of the Kremlin, Telegram has offered a relatively safe harbor where one can find Russians expressing grief, anger and frustration about the war. But this comes right alongside political narratives and disinformation from across the spectrum and plenty of tall tales from the twisted world of conspiracy theories. It is from these foundations that an organization called the Council of Mothers and Wives has sprung into existence. The Council launched its Telegram channel on September 29, just days after Putin instituted the partial draft, and now has more than 23,000 followers. Behind it is Olga Tsukanova, a 46-year-old mother who had a brief moment in the limelight when a video she posted on VK went viral. In the video, Tsukanova spoke of how her son was pressured on two separate occasions to sign a contract to be “voluntarily” sent to the front. “I address all Russian mothers,” she said into the camera. “Stop winding snot on your fist and crying into your pillow. Let’s band together.” After her video touched the hearts of mothers across the country, she decided to create the Council. When I first sat down to read through the channel, I found testimony about conditions on the front and stories of families’ difficult experiences after their loved ones were drafted. In its second post, the Council demanded practical information about the deployment: How much training would draftees receive? What winter clothing would they be issued? How would food be organized? All were reasonable demands, given the news that Russian troops were hugely under-equipped for war. Pictures of supporters across the country, mailing their demands to the authorities, right up to the office of President Putin, followed. But then another side of the channel began to emerge. Again and again, when I clicked through the links shared, I found myself on the page of another organization, the National Union of the Revival of Russia (OSVR). Established in 2019 to restore “the destroyed state of the USSR,” the OSVR looks longingly at the bygone days of the Soviet Union. It also fosters conspiracy theories on the coronavirus and 5G. According to the OSVR’s manifesto on partial mobilization, which was shared by the Council on Telegram, the war in Ukraine was “started by Chabad adherents” to build a “new Khazaria” on the territory of Russia and Ukraine — an antisemitic conspiracy theory that is grounded in the geography of the medieval Khazar empire and has prospered since the invasion. The OSVR is led by Svetlana Lada-Rus, a conspiracy theorist who believes that a third force is committing atrocities in Ukraine and has claimed that dangerous reptiles from the planet Nibiru would fly to earth and unleash chaos. The OSVR’s influence on the Council is not an accident. Tsukanova spoke at an OSVR meeting in October and was a member of the now-defunct Volya party that Lada-Rus once led. Tsukanova told a reporter from Novaya Gazeta that the OSVR helped her to create the Council: “A lot of effort is needed for this, without the support of like-minded people, it is difficult to do this. The movement itself supported me.” Both women hail from Samara, a small city near Russia’s border with Kazakhstan. “Internationally there has been a slight misinterpretation, or at least a superficial understanding, of this [Council] movement that is not to be confused with the more long-standing Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia,” Jaroslava Barbieri, a doctoral researcher on Russia at Birmingham University, told me. “If you look at Olga Tsukanova’s social media prior to the announced [partial] mobilization there is not so much talk about the so-called military operation, actually you will find content about conspiracy theories, a rogue government,” she said. “That is a bit more emblematic of a broader political stance of the members of this Council of Mothers and Wives.” In addition to promoting OSVR materials, the channel also features a not-so-healthy dose of anti-vax propaganda. Coda Story’s partners at Democracy Reporting International ran an analysis of the channel and found that more anti-vaccination content was reposted in the first week and a half of its existence than content that could be described as clearly anti-war. This peculiar cocktail of quackery, conspiracy and seemingly genuine grief about the war maintained a steady beat until mid-November, when the Council staged a public demonstration. On November 14 and 15, 2022, members of the group picketed the Western Military District headquarters in St. Petersburg where they demanded the return of mobilized troops from the Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine. Eager to get media attention, the group stressed on their Telegram channel that “no anti-war statements” were made, only a wish to open “dialogue with officials” about “specific shortcomings.” After the event, the Council got some national media coverage, which they hailed as a success. Several days later, Putin announced plans to meet with a select group of soldiers’ mothers on the outskirts of Moscow. Handpicked for their association with pro-war NGOs, or for their outright support of the so-called special military operation, these were the women the Kremlin wanted to use to calm fears around mobilization. “This is a sensitive topic for [Putin],” said Maxim Alyukov, a research fellow at the King’s College Russia Institute. “The government perceives this issue of mothers and wives as a more dangerous issue than some kinds of political criticism, because it is something which can resonate with the public, and that’s why [the Kremlin] ran their own council of mothers and wives,” he told me. For Tsukanova and her followers, the roundtable was a snub. They duly took to social media to air their grievances. “[Putin] wants to declare real mothers and wives extremists and agents. CIA?”, one Telegram post read. International media also took note. The BBC ran clips of Tsukanova saying that the Russian authorities were “absolutely” afraid of women. Democracy Reporting International’s modeling for Coda Story shows that, in the midst of these events, the Council’s Telegram channel saw a significant increase in followers. Soon, the Council’s VK page was blocked on orders from the Prosecutor General’s office and a car carrying Tsukanova was stopped in Samara under the pretext of a drug search while the passengers were questioned. But while thousands have been arrested for their anti-war activism, and others subjected to exile, the Council has been able to continue its work weaving concerns about mobilization with the world of conspiracies. Pro-Kremlin media have been quick to point out links to the OSVR, and Russia’s pro-government, anti-cult organizations have also taken pains to call out the Council and accuse them of being provocateurs. The Center for Religious Studies, led by Alexander Dvorkin, also accused the OSVR of being financed by Poland and Ukraine, a common tactic used to undermine anti-war individuals and groups in Russia. For Jakub Kalensky, a senior analyst at the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, criticism from these corners is not surprising. “This might be very beneficial for you [as the Kremlin], if you have an anti-mobilization organization that is headed by questionable characters,” said Kalensky. “You can use their background to discredit the anti-mobilization position as a whole, this is a hypothesis we could work with,” he told me. In this landscape, Russia’s anti-war activism has become ever more fragmented. Years of authoritarian rule have hollowed out the country’s civil society and stripped people of the ability to express dissent without serious repercussions. More than 2,300 people have been arrested in anti-war street protests since the partial mobilization was announced. In March 2022, legislation was introduced imposing prison sentences of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the so-called special military operation. The war has only made the stakes higher, no matter which side you’re on. Motivations for subscribing to Telegram channels undoubtedly vary — from a desire to stop mobilization to an outright anti-war, anti-Putin position. Groups that gain traction are quickly branded as extremist by the authorities. Those that aren’t often attract suspicion as having some nefarious link to the FSB, Russia’s security service. “There has been a history of infiltration of different opposition movements by the FSB either directly by speaking to members of those movements or most probably trying to send different messages to make them less appealing to different audiences,” Kasia Kaczmarska, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Edinburgh University, said. “This can sometimes work via multiple channels which the FSB is capable of organizing.” “It’s important to highlight these more complex networks and the processes of how certain institutions came about, to not conflate them with genuine anti-war movements,” Barbieri, the Birmingham University doctoral researcher, added. “We also need to start thinking about how these disinformation narratives could also work as a coping mechanism for people so as not to face the reality of how the war in Ukraine began.” Meanwhile the Council of Mothers and Wives continues to grow. As the full-scale invasion approaches its one-year anniversary, the channel blasts out condemnations of the mobilization alongside the wholesale promotion of conspiracy theories. It’s clear that the channel offers solace for some people, a place to vent their frustrations with a war they didn’t want in their lives. But for its leaders, it may be better understood as a vehicle for bringing an organization on the fringes of society to a new, and much more influential, audience. – Rappler.com This story was produced in partnership with Democracy Reporting International This article has been republished from Coda Story with permission."
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/gucci-names-sabato-de-sarno-creative-director-task-reviving-brand/,[],"PARIS, France – French luxury goods group Kering PRTP.PA has appointed Sabato De Sarno, a senior fashion designer at Valentino, as creative director of its top brand Gucci, it said on Saturday, January 28. At Gucci, he will be tasked with reviving the fortunes of a brand that accounted for two-thirds of Kering’s profits in 2021 but has been losing momentum in recent years after stellar growth in 2015-19. De Sarno, 39, began his career at Prada in 2005, before moving to Dolce & Gabbana and then joining Valentino in 2009, where he held several positions before being appointed fashion director overseeing both men’s and women’s collections, working closely with chief designer Pierpaolo Piccioli. A red carpet favourite, Piccioli is known for adding a contemporary flair to the storied Italian label’s extravagant breed of glamour, generating buzz for example with head-to-toe bright pink looks for American singer Zendaya. “I am proud to join a house with such an extraordinary history and heritage, that over the years has been able to welcome and cherish values I believe in,” De Sarno said in Kering’s statement. “I am touched and excited to contribute my creative vision for the brand.” He will present his debut Gucci runway collection at Milan Women’s Fashion Week in September 2023. Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri said that having worked with a number of Italy’s most renowned luxury fashion houses, De Sarno “brings with him a vast and relevant experience.” The choice of a seasoned but relatively unknown designer with years of experience working behind the scenes echoes the group’s strategy when it appointed its previous creative director Alessandro Michele, who did not have a public profile at the time of his appointment in 2002. “We salute Kering’s decision,” said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein. “Gucci – and the Kering shareholders – need courage and an original point of view.” Solca noted that De Sarno’s profile was reassuring. “The eyes of the world will be on him to see if he also has the required creative genius.” Gucci had been under pressure to quickly appoint someone to one of the top jobs in fashion after the abrupt departure in November of Michele, known for his flamboyant and gender-fluid styles and a favourite of singers Harry Styles and Lady Gaga. He had been in the job seven years but left following tensions with Kering’s top management, sources told Reuters. Alongside Bizzarri, he had overseen a period of soaring growth at Gucci between 2015 and 2019, with profits increasing nearly four-fold to just under 10 billion euros ($11 billion) and revenue almost trebling. But in recent quarters, Gucci had begun to lag rivals including Hermes HRMS.PA and LVMH’s LVMH.PA top brand Louis Vuitton, with its performance in the key Chinese market becoming a source of concern for investors amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Kering is due to publish full-year results on February 15. Investors will be keen to hear how the business fared after Beijing lifted its COVID restrictions late last year, leading to huge infections and the disruption of business across the country. LVMH and others have said sales recovered somewhat in the lead-up to China’s Lunar New Year holiday. But Kering’s shares were the worst performers among major luxury brands and lagged the Paris CAC 40 .FCHI and pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX over the past three years. The stock has risen 10% since January 2020 compared with a more than 100% rise in LVMH and Hermes. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/tilapia-losses-soar-fish-kill-south-cotabato-lake-january-2023/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – South Cotabato’s Lake Sebu has been hit by another wave of fish kill, which began on Wednesday, January 25, and so far affected millions of pesos worth of tilapia again over a three-day period. The ongoing fish kill, known locally as “kamahong,” is the third to hit the lake since early January, raising the number of affected fish cages to 2,023 as of Friday, January 27, in three villages. The losses so far were estimated by officials at some P7 million. Lake Sebu town is currently under a state of calamity as a result of the earlier waves of kamahong, with the local government having provided assistance to affected fisherfolks in the form of food packs. The town council is now deliberating on a possible moratorium on fish cage operations to allow for the lake’s natural rehabilitation, which could take up to a year or longer. The affected cages contain an estimated 253 tons of tilapia of various sizes, with an average market value of close to P18 million, according to lake warden Rudy Muyco. Muyco said the new wave of kamahong occurred just as tilapia raisers were still trying to recover from their losses from this month’s fish kill that affected almost half of the fish cages in the lake. The occurrence is blamed on the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the lake, caused by the lack of sunlight. The area around the lake has been experiencing rains in recent days, with the sun barely appearing, Muyco said. On Wednesday, many tilapia were seen floating in one section of the lake, causing fish cage operators to frantically catch the premature fish and sell them at discounted prices to avoid further losses. Tilapia are now sold along the roadside from P30 to P70 per kilo, depending on size, attracting wholesale buyers to the highland town, which is known among domestic tourists for its scenic spots and tilapia delicacies. Muyco said he was disappointed that despite efforts to educate tilapia raisers on proper aquaculture practices, there are still those who ignore it and continue with unsafe practices in an attempt to save on expenses. “Water hyacinth abound around many fish cages, a sign that they are not maintaining proper sanitation,” he said. He said more than half of the lake was already “technically dead” and needed drastic measures to revive it, such as a long-term moratorium where all fish pen operations must stop. Muyco’s call for a moratorium was supported by the head of the town council of Lake Sebu, who said they were considering the possible moratorium on fish cage operations to allow the lake to rehabilitate itself. Vice Mayor Remie Unggol said there was a pressing need for a moratorium to save the lake and the local tilapia raising industry, which is a main source of income for many residents, particularly the indigenous T’boli people who primarily inhabit the area. He said what was needed was a moratorium that would last six months to even one year in order to allow the lake’s full rehabilitation. Unggol also said the town council would revisit an existing town ordinance on fish pen operations in the lake which has not been enforced for many years. Lake Sebu, the largest of the three lakes in the town, has more than 5,000 fish cages, mostly for tilapia, occupying about a third of the lake’s area. Despite attempts to limit the number of fish cages in the lake, the number has increased over the years instead. Lake Sebu has at present more than 2,000 fish pen operators, many of whom are businessmen and government people from other places, according to Unggol. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/photos-lanao-del-sur-mananggiti-tuba-coconut-wine-tapper/,[],"Twenty-two-year-old Judelo Omaga of the village of Lorenzo in Balabagan, Lanao del Sur, attends to his daily routine to collect sap from more than 20 coconut trees that he maintains. The coconut sap is what is turned into tubâ, an alcoholic beverage. Judelo has been working as a mananggiti (coconut wine tapper) for 10 years now, climbing coconut trees since he was 12 years old, and mastering the art of tubâ-making which his father trained him to do. He does everything from the sap-tapping to the fermenting. According to Judelo, he can collect an average of 10 gallons daily, process, and then sells it once it becomes a fine tubâ at P50 per gallon to his regular buyers. After collecting, the coconut sap undergoes fermentation. The aging process can take anywhere from three days to a month to produce the kind of tubâ that is richer in alcohol content and with a smoother and more floral taste. He said that if properly aged, the slightly astringent-tasting tubâ would be a perfect blend with cola or if mixed with condensed milk and raw egg as many prefer it. According to a published article in Wine Enthusiast on April 8, 2021, Arturo Pancho, a retired administrator of the City of Los Angeles, California wrote a 2015 book titled Discovering Tubâ “to raise awareness for the beverage and encourage broader production. “Scaling bottling and standardizing quality is no easy task,” he stated, “but it would ultimately bring more profits for farmers and sap gatherers.” Pancho added, “Coconut wine is important for our own history, it’s a part of who we are. We need to recognize that.” – Omar Juanday/PonD News Asia"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/memphis-disbands-police-unit-after-fatal-beating-protests-continue/,[],"MEMPHIS, Tennessee – The specialized police unit that included at least some of the Memphis officers involved in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols was disbanded on Saturday, January 28, as more protests took place in US cities a day after harrowing video of the attack was released. In a statement, the police department said it was permanently deactivating the SCORPION unit after the police chief spoke with members of Nichols’ family, community leaders and other officers. Video recordings from police body-worn cameras and a camera mounted on a utility pole showed Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, repeatedly screaming “Mom!” as officers kicked, punched and struck him with a baton in his mother’s neighborhood after a January 7 traffic stop. He was hospitalized and died of his injuries three days later. Five officers involved in the beating, all Black, were charged on Thursday with murder, assault, kidnapping and other charges. All have been dismissed from the department. Nichols’ family and officials expressed outrage and sorrow but urged protesters to remain peaceful. That request was largely heeded on Friday when scattered protests broke out in Memphis – where marchers briefly blocked an interstate highway – and elsewhere. Several cities saw renewed demonstrations on Saturday. In Memphis, protesters chanting, “Whose streets? Our streets!” angrily catcalled a police car that was monitoring the march, with several making obscene gestures. Some cheered loudly when they learned of the disbandment of SCORPION. Hundreds of protesters gathered in New York’s Washington Square Park before marching through downtown Manhattan, as columns of police officers walked alongside them. Taken together, the four video clips released Friday showed police pummeling Nichols even though he appeared to pose no threat. The initial traffic stop was for reckless driving, though the police chief has said the cause for the stop has not been substantiated. The SCORPION unit, short for the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in our Neighborhoods, had been formed in October 2021 to concentrate on crime hot spots. Critics say such specialized teams can be prone to abusive tactics. Friends and family say Nichols was an affable, talented skateboarder who grew up in Sacramento, California, and moved to Memphis before the coronavirus pandemic. The father of a 4-year-old child, Nichols worked at FedEx and had recently enrolled in a photography class. Nate Spates Jr., 42, was part of a circle of friends, including Nichols, who met up at a local Starbucks. “He liked what he liked, and he marched to the beat of his own drum,” Spates said, remembering that Nichols would go to a park called Shelby Farms to watch the sunset when he wasn’t working a late shift. Nichols’ death is the latest high-profile example of police using excessive force against Black people and other minorities. The 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, galvanized worldwide protests over racial injustice. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/reflection-political-love-archbishop-socrates-villegas/,[],"The following is a speech delivered by Archbishop Socrates B. Villegas on Thursday, January 26, at Saint Louis University in Baguio City on the occasion of the conferment of the honorary degree Doctor of Philosophy. Rappler is republishing this speech with his permission. Very Reverend Father Gilbert Sales, CICM, brothers and sisters in Christ: Thank you Father Gilbert Sales, CICM, and the faculty of Saint Louis University (SLU) in Baguio City for this unexpected and undeserved honor. I can now say with pride that I am an alumnus of this university. I am still asking why SLU decided to include me in your list of honorary degree recipients. I suppose you know that together with some bishops and priests, I have been accused of sedition and inciting to sedition? I suppose you are aware that I have been called nasty and cuss names and the God I serve was branded stupid? I suppose you know that I have been threatened not only with imprisonment but also death? From one point of view I am a high-risk man. SLU, why me? I stand not on my personal convictions but on the teachings of our Church and the Gospel of my Master. If you tell me that you want to honor my Master and my mother Church, I accept this honor with a deep sense of gratitude. Not to me but to God and the Church be the honor! Philippine Christianity has been dubbed by many as “nominal Catholicism” or “split-level.” People say we have been baptized but not really evangelized. At the risk of generalization, many of our social values do not really exhibit the Christian faith. PCP II writes: “If we go by the media reporting today on crimes of violence, graft and corruption, abuse of power, the many grave social ills that plague the nation, we have to wonder about our claims to Christianity” (PCP II, 15). Written more than 30 years ago, it is still an apt description of our present society. There seems to be a noticeable divide between our faith and our politics, between our religious practices and our economic undertakings, between our believing and our everyday living. This dualistic divide came to a hilt during the last election. When our pastors talked against corruption and historical revisionism, and pointed out the social culprits, many pious lay people, and clergy themselves, charged them with “politicking”. “Ang mga pari ay dapat mangangaral lamang tungkol sa kabutihan, pagpapatawad at pananampalataya. Hindi na dapat sumawsaw pa sa pulitika.” Observers notice four kinds of Christians around us. First, there are “apolitical Christians” – those who think that our home is in “heaven” and what happens in this “world” is of little value at all. Political participation does not help achieve salvation; it is at best a distraction. Second, there are “neutral Christians” – those who follow the minimum requirements of political duties like the elections, but consider it a “private affair.” There is no connection between their faith and their socio-political option. Third, there are Christians who are “non-neutral but also nonpartisan”. They call out society on human rights violations but refuse to name names or promote partisan candidates. This is the ideal for the clergy and religious, or the canon law exhorts them to be. Fourth, there are Christians who are “non-neutral and partisan”. They are those who, because of their Christian conviction, engage in social and political issues and get involved in partisan politics. Among your friends, you can count them by your fingers. The last two are possible Christian responses. But the first two have never been a viable Christian option at all. Let me elaborate this in recent theological developments. Pope Francis recently became viral with this quotation: “A good Catholic meddles in politics, offering the best of himself, so that those who govern can govern.” The main idea is actually based in his recent encyclical, Fratelli Tutti: “Politics is a lofty vocation and one of the highest forms of charity, inasmuch as it seeks the common good” (FT 180). But Pope Francis was only quoting Pope Benedict XVI. Benedict has been always criticized as a conservative pope, one who has always advised us to shun politics. Both his critics and traditionalist admirers misuse him to advance their own agenda. We are still mourning his loss. But we need to recover one of the late pope’s greatest contributions to the theology of Christian social engagement. Writing a little more than 40 years after Populorum Progressio which talked about development of peoples, Benedict’s contribution is to root authentic social development in love, truth, and justice. He did this in Deus Caritas Est  (2005) and Caritas In Veritate (2009) – his last two social encyclicals. We can synthesize this in three simple points. First, everything proceeds from love. “God is love (Deus caritas est): everything has its origin in God’s love, everything is shaped by it, everything is directed towards it” (CV, 2). Second, charity can only shine in truth – the truth of God and the truth and dignity of human beings. “Only in truth does charity shine forth; only in truth can charity be authentically lived” (CV, 3). When lies and deception abound, charity also dims in our lives. Third, this charity in truth can only be lived in just relationships within society (Caritas in veritate in re sociale). “On the one hand, charity demands justice: recognition and respect for the legitimate rights of individuals and peoples… On the other hand, charity transcends justice and completes it in the logic of giving and forgiving” (CV 6). Each Christian therefore is asked to practice this kind of charity that seeks the common good within political societies. “This is the institutional path – we might also call it the political path – of charity, no less excellent and effective than the kind of charity which encounters the neighbor directly” (CV 7). If there is anything that the late pope wanted to say, it is this: that true development of peoples (the consistent theme since Populorum Progressio) can only be pursued in charity illumined by truth and justice in social, juridical, cultural, political and economic fields. Pope Francis picks up from where Benedict XVI has left off. He developed these deep metaphysical reflections into its concrete social and political ramifications. He names it “political love”. In Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis writes, “Love, overflowing with small gestures of mutual care, is also civic and political, and it makes itself felt in every action that seeks to build a better world. For this reason, charity finds expression not only in close and intimate relationships but also in macro-relationships: social, economic and political” (FT, 181). When a person in need – the one stranded on the road – shows up at some crossroads in our lives, what shall a Christian do? Reflecting on the parable of the Good Samaritan, he says: “Now there are only two kinds of people: those who care for someone who is hurting and those who pass by; those who bend down to help and those who look the other way and hurry off” (FT, 70). Two corollaries: (1) our choice to pass by or stop by someone in need defines our humanity; (2) charity is not just a personal virtue; it is an institutional act. First, Pope Francis forced the Christian conscience to make a crucial decision in its encounter with social vulnerability. Political charity is not optional. It is a necessary choice, if one wants to be Christian; or better still, if one wants to be human. In front of the vulnerable and the needy, neutrality is not a Christian option. When people are killed left and right or when they are dying because the leaders of our society stole the money which is due them, to be neutral is immoral. “In the face of the victim, those who are neutral are allies of the victimizers” (FT 75). We are then forced to ask what is our basic life direction? The great Protestant activist and preacher, Martin Luther King Jr. commented on the Good Samaritan: “The first question which the priest and Levite asked was: ‘If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me? But the Good Samaritan reversed the question: ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?” We either go on with life preferring our personal safety or offering ourselves for the service of others. However one decides spells what ethics call our “fundamental option.” Do we bend down to help or do we look the other way and hurry off? Your answer spells who fundamentally you are. Second corollary: love is social. The Good Samaritan was able to help because there was an inn. He could not carry the dying all the way by himself. Charity is not only a personal virtue; it is structural and institutional. Charity should “not only be affective; it should also be effective,” Saint Vincent de Paul used to preach. Martin Luther King continues: “I am tired of assisting stranded people on the road,” he says, “I will make this road safer so that there will be no more robbers on this way.” Beyond the feeling of pity for someone and helping him with a series of benevolent acts, compassion means making social, political, and economic structures of society work for the victims and the vulnerable. It means setting up a network that defends human rights; preaching to denounce social evil; campaigning for and electing honest politicians, or working for justice and peace. These are hardly neutral activities at all. One can get killed doing these things like the prophets of old. Today as you honor the unworthy me with this Doctorate in Philosophy, I renew my pledge. I will live for love and be ready to die for love. I will make peace through dialogue. I do not believe in peace without justice. I will make peace through love. I do not believe in peace without repentance. I will make peace through prayer; I do not believe in peace without God. I believe in peace because I believe in God. Help me to make peace and be ready to pay its price. Let my life be for peace; when I die or if they kill me… May the world receive new peace in my sacrifice! – Rappler.com Socrates B.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/filipino-americans-california-make-voices-heard-stop-hate/,[],"This story is published in partnership with SoJannelleTV, a magazine show about Filipinos in North America. For Asian Americans, the recent mass shootings in California have brought a national epidemic to their front doorstep. Though the shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, which targeted mostly people of Asian descent, appear to not have been racially motivated, it underlines the rise of violence against Asian Americans since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes against Asian Americans in California increased 177.5% in 2021 from the previous year, according to a report from the California Department of Justice. In an effort to combat that troubling statistic, the California State Library partnered with ethnic media outlets, among them So Jannelle TV, for the “Stop the Hate” program. So Jannelle centers its mission on presenting stories of immigration and representation in the Filipino-American community. Airing US-wide on cable channels The Filipino Channel (TFC) and ANC, as well as on local Southern CA digital channel KNET 25.1, the program has given Filipino Americans the platforms to let their voices be heard and shed light on issues of discrimination that they have experienced. “Ethnic media outlets are in a really special position in terms of being able to convey messages, not just to the community that they serve, but connect the different communities,” California State Librarian Greg Lucas told Filipino-American media pioneer Jannelle So Perkins, also the founder, host, and producer of So Jannelle TV. “One of the things I like about this program is that a number of the proposals we received weren’t specific to one community. They were like, how do we take our experience and be able to share that in a broader way around California, which in turn then educates other parts of California and as a result, creates more empathy and understanding?” For Rob Bonta, the Quezon City-born attorney general of California, the rise in anti-Asian violence is a personal battle. He said his fight against discrimination began at home, where his family taught him to buck expectations to not “rock the boat” and speak out against injustices. “This is personal for me and and for so many others as someone who was born in the Philippines, who was raised in this this country as a Filipino American who all too often, like so many, felt the sting of hate in all its forms, whether it be harassment or discrimination or prejudice or bigotry or being ‘othered,'” said Bonta, the first Filipino American to be named California attorney general. In another So Jannelle episode about how the Filipino community can unite to combat racism, music star Apl.de.ap said open discussion about these issues is important to raise awareness. He offered other tips, including offering rides to older people so they can avoid commuting and learning self-defense. “Minorities, we need to get together, collaborate,” said Apl.de.ap, before So Perkins interjected, “and demand respect.” “Yes, demand respect,” Apl.de.ap echoed. The “Stop the Hate” campaign has led to funding for direct services for victims and survivors of hate crimes while facilitating anti-hate prevention measures through arts and cultural work, as well as building cross-racial alliances and senior safety programs. Partnerships with media outlets that serve the communities that are impacted are essential to informing the public about these resources, and So Jannelle is proud to do its part. “Our shared pursuit has never been more critical. Hate has reached a boiling point in our nation,” added Attorney General Bonta. “There is no single solution to this crisis, but what I do know is that we are going to solve this together and the state has resources to assist you in your work.” – Jannelle So Productions | Rappler.com Rappler is partnering with Jannelle So Productions Inc (JSP), founded by Filipino-American pioneer and Los Angeles-based journalist Jannelle So, to publish video and written stories from SoJannelleTV about the journeys, successes, and challenges of Filipinos living in America.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/digital-id-indian-kashmir-questions-surveillance/,[],"SRINAGAR, India – University student Mehak is used to frequent identification checks by security forces and officials in the northern Indian city of Srinagar, and always carries two forms of ID. Soon, she may need to carry yet another in her purse. Plans for a new family ID in Jammu and Kashmir have caused confusion and irritation among many residents like Mehak, while rights campaigners fear the program could lead to increased surveillance and data hacks in the disputed Himalayan region. “Families already use their ID cards if they need to access any social welfare programs. So why is this required?,” said Mehak, 22, who asked that her last name be withheld. Regional authorities have said the JK Family ID, an eight-digit code assigned to each household, would improve access to social welfare benefits such as subsidized food grains. It means families will not have to apply for benefits under various schemes, as eligibility decisions will be automated based on the data, said Prerna Puri, a commissioner in Kashmir’s information technology department. Across India, the government is undertaking a massive digitization push, including of health records, property titles, railway bookings and utility payments, as part of the Digital India program aimed at better governance. In Indian Kashmir, some see the new family IDs as part of a campaign to exert greater control over residents. The Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew Kashmir’s autonomous status in 2019, and split the former state into two federal territories, aiming to tighten its grip on the Muslim-majority region. Kashmir residents are right to be wary of the government’s motives, said Angad Singh Khalsa, an independent human rights campaigner, as they have been singled out before for greater surveillance on the grounds of national security. “Even if the government intends to provide us with benefits by creating these new IDs, their authoritarian treatment towards the people of Jammu and Kashmir has made us doubt their intentions,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Kashmir is claimed in full, but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over the territory. A crackdown on an Islamist militant uprising and public protests against Indian rule in the region have killed thousands of people, mostly in the 1990s, when the violence peaked. Since its special status was revoked, scores more civilians, security personnel and militants have been killed. In anticipation of protests after the move, the authorities imposed a curfew, cut the internet for long periods, and tightened security. From 2020, the government has required everyone in Jammu and Kashmir to apply for domicile certificates that allow them to vote in local elections, buy farmland and houses, and apply to public universities and for jobs. Many residents, particularly Muslims, have not signed up for these certificates, uncertain of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party’s motives. The new family IDs have made people even more wary. “Creating ‘a unique family ID’ for J&K residents is emblematic of the widening trust deficit” after 2019, Mehbooba Mufti, an opposition leader and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a tweet. “Kashmiris are viewed with deep suspicion & this is another surveillance tactic to tighten the iron grip on their lives.” Issues over India’s national Aadhaar digital IDs have highlighted risks over inclusion and data leaks, say activists. India introduced Aadhaar in 2009 to streamline welfare payments and reduce wastage in public spending. Since then, it has become mandatory for everything from accessing SIM cards to filing taxes to accessing welfare benefits. Yet millions of Indians do not have Aadhaar, including large numbers of homeless, transgender, and indigenous Adivasi people who may not have a permanent address, or other documents needed for registration. Security researchers and journalists have also reported multiple vulnerabilities and data leaks tied to the program, though officials have downplayed the reports and said biometric data was safe from hacking. Increased data collection for the JK Family ID and the absence of a federal data protection law make residents vulnerable to greater surveillance and exclusion, said Anushka Jain, policy counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group in Delhi. A new draft of a long-delayed data protection law has not yet been passed by parliament. “Any data collection exercise can result in harm. Especially when there are no safeguards, and we have no idea how the data will be used, how it will be stored, and how it will be accessed,” said Jain. “Even with individual Aadhaar IDs, there is so much exclusion. With family IDs, if there are errors in the data or if one member is caught up in something, then the entire family can be excluded, so the potential for harm is much greater.” Authorities in Kashmir have said they will collect data with the consent of beneficiaries, and that relevant data protection laws will be applied. Officials have also said they will strengthen the cybersecurity framework. Kashmir’s family ID is similar to digital IDs introduced in Haryana state in 2020 to allocate welfare benefits. But in a region that has lagged the rest of the country on investments and economic growth for decades, there are more pressing needs, said Asrar Reeshi, a resident in Srinagar. “I don’t see how an eight-digit ID will benefit people when there are so many other problems, such as the economic crisis, a lack of hospitals, and an inadequate education system,” said the 21-year-old student. “They can’t even protect Aadhaar data. Instead of gathering more data to monitor us and violate our privacy, the government should concentrate on giving jobs to unemployed youth.” – Rappler.com Originally published on Context."

Learning from a near-collapse against the UAE national team in the last game, former NBA player Shabazz Muhammad drilled home a sense of urgency with an early offensive spurt, and finished with a game-high 26 points off the bench on 9-of-14 shooting in just 22 minutes. Veteran forward Renaldo Balkman was near-unstoppable in his 25-minute run as well and cruised to an easy 18 points on a 7-of-8 clip to go with 9 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals, while Sedrick Barefield led the local crew with 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Strong Group’s top acquisition Nick Young failed to get it going and settled for just 3 points on a 1-of-7 clip in 22 minutes, but locals like Justine Baltazar (10 points), BJ Andrade (9 points), and Kevin Quiambao (9 points) picked up the rest of the scoring slack in his stead. It was a one-sided affair from the get-go as the Philippine team fired off a 24-6 start with Muhammad, Balkman, and Andrade taking turns in picking apart the slacking Libyan defense. Al Nasr managed to trim the deficit back to single digits, 57-66, midway through the third period, but a 17-1 burst bridging the last two quarters erased all doubt of a Libya comeback as Strong Group started the final frame up 25, 83-58. Quiambao then drilled a triple with 5:49 left in regulation to peak with a 26-point separation, 88-62, and Al Nasr never again threatened the Philippine team until the final buzzer. Donte Lamnot paced the loss with 22 points in just 25 minutes, while big men Michael Babatond and Mamadou Mbaye added 14 and 11 points, respectively. Strong Group will get less than a day’s rest as it guns for its third straight win on Sunday, January 29, 11 pm (Manila time) against Al Wahda Syria.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/department-tourism-boost-mindanao-tourist-spots/,[],"DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – The Mindanao Tourism Expo officially opened in Davao City on Friday, January 27, with Tourism Secretary Cristina Frasco announcing plans to boost Mindanao tourism by highlighting lesser-known destinations on the island and signing a memorandum of agreement with other government departments to improve security. Officials said the new government program, “Bisita: Be my guest,” would offer perks to citizens and groups who bring in foreign tourists. The expo runs until Sunday, January 29, and features exhibits from various tourism companies and government offices. Frasco said the Department of Tourism (DOT) was working to see tourist numbers return to pre-pandemic levels, even in Mindanao, by 2025. Frasco graced the opening of the first ever three-day Mindanao Tourism Expo at the SMX Convention Center in SM Lanang Premier in Davao where she said the new DOT campaign would “highlight the lesser-known yet fabulous world-class destinations” in the country’s second-largest island, which has been left behind due to years of insurgency and extremism. Frasco also announced that the tourism department would sign a tripartite memorandum of agreement with the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to tighten measures for “peace and security, which are the very foundations of reopening Mindanao tourism.” Tanya Rabat Tan, the DOT director in the Davao Region, said Mindanao is home to a wide range of attractions, vibrant cultures, friendly communities, and rich history – things that should be capitalized on in the tourism thrust in the Southern Philippines. Davao Mayor Sebastian Duterte, for his part, said the local government was revitalizing the tourism sector in the biggest city in Mindanao by developing “new tourism circuits.” The first Mindanao Tourism Expo features public displays from different DOT regional offices, local governments, tour operators, airline and transportation companies, tourism establishments, food providers, and related service providers. The expo, which is being held until Sunday, includes a wide range of activities such as learning sessions, business-to-business and business-to-customer meetings, and opportunities for travel exchanges. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-calls-united-states-pledge-tanks-ukraine-unethical-crime/,[],"SEOUL – North Korea on Sunday, January 29, criticized for a second day a US decision to send tanks to Ukraine, calling it an “unethical crime” aimed at perpetuating an unstable international situation. Washington’s allegations that North Korea has provided arms to Russia are a “groundless rumor” to justify its own military aid to Ukraine, Kwon Chung-keun, director of US affairs at North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA. “The US is working hard to supply such offensive weapons as (main battle tanks) to Ukraine at any cost in disregard of the just concern and criticism of the international community,” the statement said. “This is an unethical crime aimed at keeping the international situation unstable.” The baseless claims of North Korea-Russia arms deals are a “grave provocation that can never be allowed” and perpetuating them will bring a “really undesirable result,” Kwon added. On Saturday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, denounced US pledges of battle tanks to Ukraine, claiming Washington was “further crossing the red line” to win hegemony by proxy war, KCNA reported. Nuclear-armed North Korea launched an unprecedented number of missiles last year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. US and South Korean officials have also warned the North could be preparing for its first test of a nuclear device since 2017. The White House said in December that North Korea completed an initial arms delivery of infantry rockets and missiles to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to shore up Russian forces in Ukraine. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/israel-promises-swift-response-synagogue-shooting/,[],"JERUSALEM – Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged on Saturday, January 28, a “strong, swift and precise” response to a deadly Palestinian shooting attack near a synagogue on Jerusalem’s outskirts, as its military sent more troops into the occupied West Bank. Seven people were killed in Friday’s attack and two others were wounded in another shooting in the city on Saturday. “We are not seeking escalation, but we are prepared for any scenario,” Netanyahu said as he convened his security cabinet. He later said the security cabinet decided to increase gun permits for licensed civilians to defend against street attacks. Before the meeting, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would push for the move. A 13-year-old Palestinian boy in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Silwan opened fire on Saturday at a group of Israeli passers-by, wounding two, before he was shot and wounded by one of them, police said. The Israeli military said a Palestinian spotted on the edge of a West Bank settlement and armed with a handgun was “neutralized.” The Jerusalem attack on Friday followed an Israeli raid on Thursday in the West Bank city of Jenin that killed nine Palestinians, including seven gunmen, and cross-border fire on Friday between Israel and Gaza. An Israeli military spokesperson said an additional battalion had been sent to the West Bank for reinforcement. There was no sign, however, Israel was preparing for a large-scale operation, and its brief cross-border exchange with Gaza ended with no casualties. On Monday U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is due to arrive for a two-day visit to Israel and the West Bank, where clashes have worsened for months. Thursday’s raid was the deadliest in years in the West Bank, where Israel has stepped up operations since a spate of deadly Palestinian street attacks in its cities last year. At least 30 Palestinians – militants and civilians – have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the month. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the pro-settler Religious Zionism party and like Ben-Gvir is in Netanyahu’s security cabinet, said he demands Israeli settlement construction plans in the West Bank speed up. Netanyahu said after the cabinet meeting that he had decided on steps that would be brought forward this week “to strengthen settlements,” without elaborating. At a Jerusalem hospital treating casualties, Ben-Gvir said more gun permits were justified. “I want weapons on the street. I want Israeli citizens to be able to protect themselves,” he said. Friday’s attack outside a synagogue was the deadliest in the Jerusalem area since 2008. It took place in a neighbourhood on land that Israel annexed to Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East war, in a move not recognised internationally. The gunman, Khaire Alkam, was a 21-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem. Among the dead was a 14-year-old boy, police said. No group has claimed responsibility for the shooting and Alkam’s father told Reuters his son had no links to militants. Forty-two suspects, including his family members, were arrested, police said. Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided to pursue sanctions against families of attackers. Police said Alkam arrived at 8:15 p.m. and opened fire with a handgun, hitting a number of people before he was killed by police. The gunman was a relative of a 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot dead on Wednesday in clashes with Israeli forces in a Jerusalem refugee camp, his family said. His father, Moussa Alkam, said he did not know whether his son was seeking revenge. “He is neither the first nor the last young man to get martyred and what he did is a source of pride,” Alkam said. Shimon Israel, 56, who lives near the attack site, said on Saturday his family was starting their Sabbath dinner when they heard shooting and screaming. He opened the window and saw his neighbour running on the street to get the police. “I told him ‘Eli, don’t go there. Eli don’t go.’ He got married only a year ago. A good neighbour, like a brother. He ran. I saw him fall there,” Israel told Reuters. “Natali, his wife, ran after him. She saw someone here and was trying to resuscitate him. The terrorist came and shot her from behind and got her too,” he said. In Tel Aviv, tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrating against Netanyahu’s plans to overhaul Israel’s judiciary, began the protest on Saturday with a minute of silence for the dead. Friday’s shooting, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, drew wide condemnation, including by Washington, the United Nations and Israel’s Arab and Western allies. A Ukrainian woman was among the dead, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in Kyiv. Saudi Arabia, which does not have formal ties with Israel, condemned the targeting of civilians and an escalation in violence must be halted. Lebanon’s Iran-backed group Hezbollah praised the attack, as did Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas made no mention of the attack in a statement published by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, and blamed Israel for the escalation in violence. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, which has limited governing powers in the West Bank, suspended security cooperation arrangements with Israel after Thursday’s Jenin raid. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/novak-djokovic-battles-stefanos-tsitsipas-high-stakes-2023-australian-open-final/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic will look to rise above the drama that has engulfed him at Melbourne Park and claim a record-extending 10th Australian Open title on Sunday, January 29, in a generational clash against Stefanos Tsitsipas. A year after being deported from Australia on the eve of the Grand Slam for lacking COVID-19 vaccination, Djokovic has battled a hamstring strain, heckling spectators and a media storm over his father mixing with fans toting banned Russian flags at the tennis. In handling everything within his control, though, Djokovic has been supreme. The Serb’s dominant semifinal victory over American Tommy Paul on Friday stretched his winning streak at the event to a record 27 in the professional era, eclipsing Andre Agassi’s 26-match run between 2000 to 2004. Never beaten at Melbourne Park after reaching the semis, fourth seed Djokovic is rated an unbackable favorite to triumph again under the floodlights at Rod Laver Arena. Despite that, the decider presents possibly the best matchup fans could have hoped for following the early exit of injured champion Rafa Nadal. It offers a rematch of the dramatic 2021 French Open final, in which Djokovic came back from two sets down to snatch the title and leave Greek Tsitsipas heartbroken. Not that the match was fresh in Djokovic’s memory. “I think he (Tsitsipas) has never played a (Grand Slam) finals, am I wrong?” Djokovic asked incredulous reporters this week. The stakes are sky-high for both players. At 35, Djokovic needs one major title to draw level with 36-year-old Nadal’s 22 in the all-time Grand Slam race. Meanwhile third seed Tsitsipas is desperate to become the first Greek to win a Grand Slam crown, having put the nation on the tennis map. Whoever wins will take the world No. 1 ranking from Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz, who missed the tournament through injury. At 24, Tsitsipas may feel his time has come. He buried his semifinal hoodoo at Melbourne Park against Russian bruiser Karen Khachanov in four sets on Friday after falling three times previously at the hurdle. “These are the moments I’ve been working hard for,” said Tsitsipas. “To be able to play in finals that have a bigger meaning than just the final.” The atmosphere promises to be electric, and possibly volatile as tension builds. Melbourne’s strong Greek community, the most populous outside Greece itself, will be in full voice at Rod Laver Arena. They will rival the army of Serbian supporters who have gorged on Djokovic’s success since his first title at Melbourne Park as a 20-year-old in 2008. Neutral fans, meanwhile, could well rally behind Tsitsipas in the hope of seeing a genuine contest. With a huge serve, thumping groundstrokes and comfort on all areas of the court, Tsitsipas has the weapons to trouble anyone on tour. Whether he has the endurance and mental fortitude to dislodge iron man Djokovic remains to be seen. For all the huff and puff of the younger generation, only Daniil Medvedev has managed to beat the Serb in a completed match at a hardcourt Grand Slam since a shock fourth round loss to Chung Hyeon in the 2018 Australian Open. Not even Nadal or retired great Roger Federer have ever bested Djokovic in a final at Melbourne Park, and the Serb is hell-bent on extending that incredible record. “Of course, I have professional goals and ambitions. Those are Grand Slams and being No. 1 in the world,” said Djokovic. “So I do want to make more history of this sport, no doubt.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/czech-republic-presidential-election-results-updates-january-28-2023/,[],"PRAGUE, Czech Republic – Former Czech army chief Petr Pavel, a strongly pro-Western candidate who backs aid for Ukraine, was on course to win the Czech Republic’s presidential election as voting results came in on Saturday, January 28. Prime Minister Petr Fiala congratulated Pavel on securing victory after results from 87.9% of the country’s voting districts had him leading the vote count with 56.9% to his rival Andrej Babis’s 43.1%, according to the Czech Statistical Office. Full results from the two-day run-off vote were expected later on Saturday. A projection by news website www.seznamzpravy.cz showed Pavel beating former prime minister Babis with between 57.9% and 58.5% of the vote, while broadcaster CNN Prima News, using voting models from agencies STEM and STEM/MARK, also projected Pavel winning more than 58%. Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the center-right government, which ousted Babis from power in a 2021 parliamentary election. Babis, 68, a combative business magnate, had sought to attract voters struggling with soaring prices by vowing to push the government to do more to help them. A dominant force in Czech politics for the past decade and leader of parliament’s biggest opposition party, Babis had also called the election a referendum on him. Pavel faced a strong chance of keeping his election lead, with larger, urban voting districts which are likely to favor him still to report. Campaign workers for Pavel were already popping champagne at his election base in Prague where hundreds of journalists and guests were gathered and shouts of “president!” were heard. Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has backed keeping the central European country of 10.5 million firmly in the European Union and NATO military alliance, and supports the government’s continued aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last year. He is a backer of adopting the euro, a topic that successive governments have kept on the back burner, and supports gay marriage and other progressive policies. A career soldier, Pavel joined the army in Communist times, was decorated with a French military cross for valor during peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and later rose to lead the Czech general staff and become chairman of NATO’s military committee for three years before retiring in 2018. “I voted for Mr. Pavel because he is a decent and reasonable man and I think that the young generation has a future with him,” said Abdulai Diop, 60, after voting in Prague on Saturday. Babis attacked Pavel for being the government’s candidate. He campaigned on fears of the war in Ukraine spreading, and sought to offer to broker peace talks while suggesting Pavel, as a former soldier, could drag the Czechs into a war, a claim Pavel has rejected. Babis also had the support of outgoing President Milos Zeman, a divisive figure over his 10 years in office who pushed for closer ties with Beijing and – until Russia invaded Ukraine – with Moscow, as well as fringe forces including the pro-Russian Communist Party. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/india-expects-more-clashes-chinese-troops-himalayas/,[],"NEW DELHI, India – A security assessment by Indian police in the Himalayan region of Ladakh says there could be more clashes between Indian and Chinese troops along their contested frontier there as Beijing ramps up military infrastructure in the region. At least 24 soldiers were killed when the armies of the Asian giants clashed in Ladakh, in the western Himalayas, in 2020 but tensions eased after military and diplomatic talks. A fresh clash erupted between the two sides in the eastern Himalayas in December but there were no deaths. The assessment is part of a new, confidential research paper by the Ladakh Police that was submitted at a conference of top police officers held from January 20 to 22 and has been reviewed by Reuters. The Indian army did not respond to a request for comment and China’s foreign ministry said the situation along the border was at present generally stable. The report said the assessment was based on intelligence gathered by local police in the border areas and the pattern of India-China military tensions over the years. The assessment assumes significance as it was submitted at the conference in New Delhi, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India’s defense and foreign ministries also did not respond to requests for comment. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson’s office on Saturday, January 28, said China was maintaining close communication and dialogue through diplomatic and military channels with India. “Aksai Chin is an inseparable part of China’s territory,” the ministry said, referring to a disputed region that lies at the intersection of China’s Xinjiang and Tibet and to the east of Ladakh in India. Since the latest confrontation began in 2020, China has beefed up infrastructure along the Himalayan frontier, building facilities for its soldiers deployed there, storehouses for weapons and ammunition and helipads, among others. The ministry said carrying out normal construction on its own territory is a matter entirely within China’s sovereignty. Referring to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) the Indian research paper said, “Given the domestic compulsions…in China and their economic interests in the region, the PLA would continue to build up its military infrastructure and skirmishes would also get frequent which may or may not follow a pattern.” “If we analyze the pattern of skirmishes and tensions, the intensity has increased since 2013-2014 with an interval of every 2-3 years,” it said. “With the massive infrastructure build up by PLA on Chinese side both the armies are testing each other’s reaction, strength of artillery, and infantry mobilization time”. India and China share a 3,500 kilometers (2,100 miles) border that has been disputed since the 1950s. The two sides went to war over it in 1962. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/tips-dealing-food-poisoning/,['AMANDA T. LAGO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The issue of food poisoning has been in the headlines lately, and in truth, it always hits when you least expect it. After all, you can get food poisoning from practically anything that’s been contaminated. However, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some foods are more often linked to food poisoning cases than others. These include unwashed raw fruits and vegetables, raw or undercooked meat, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, and raw shellfish. The CDC also singled out oysters’ link to food poisoning, saying that they (and other filter-feeding shellfish) can contain viruses or bacteria that lead to illness or even death. For oysters, in particular, they can contain a virus called norovirus or a bacteria called vibrio, both of which cause symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, and fever. If you do end up sick after an unsuspecting dinner out with friends, don’t panic. Most food poisoning cases can be treated at home and resolved within a matter of days. When your stomach starts feeling funky after a meal, here are a few tips to deal with it: Vomitting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration sooner than you think, so when you’re down with food poisoning, make it your number one goal to stay hydrated. Having recently gone through a bout of food poisoning myself, I was told by my doctor that sports beverages are okay but not enough because we lose a lot of electrolytes along with the fluid. Oral rehydration salts such as Hydrite are much more effective. She also advised me to observe my urine frequency. Apparently, going for more than six hours without urinating is a clear sign that you’re dehydrated. When you’re spending the hours at a time on the toilet, it’s likely that the first thing you want to do is pop your favorite anti-diarrhea pill just to make it stop. However, this medication is not recommended for everybody. According to the Mayo Clinic, you may only take antimotility drugs like Loperamide if your stool isn’t bloody or if you have no fever. In any case, it’s best to consult your doctor before taking any medication. Obviously, you don’t want to upset your already upset stomach even further by plying it with food that’s highly-seasoned or difficult to digest. At this point, lugaw is life (also crackers, plain toast, and bananas). The Mayo Clinic also recommends staying away from dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine as you recover. Even when your stomach settles down, take your time and give yourself a few days before eating as you normally would. That samgyupsal all-you-can-eat can wait. If there’s a good reason to take a sick leave from work (or from life), food poisoning might be it. Obviously, diarrhea and vomiting are better dealt with at home, but food poisoning’s other symptoms – headaches, cramps, nausea – can also be eased by simply resting. If your case is not so severe, you might be tempted to just power through it and just take more bathroom breaks than usual, but that might just add to the stress that your body is already feeling. Chances are, taking a day or two to just stay home, relax, and sleep will allow you to recover sooner. If you plan on taking medication, getting in touch with a doctor is important anyway, even if it’s just through teleconsult. But more importantly, if your symptoms are really bad – as in, you aren’t able to keep any fluids down – or if they don’t improve within a few days, head to the nearest emergency room right away. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-women-final-results-aryna-sabalenka-elena-rybakina-january-28-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Aryna Sabalenka bludgeoned her way to a maiden Grand Slam title at the Australian Open with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over Kazakh 22nd seed Elena Rybakina on Saturday, January 28, in a thrilling final between two of the most exciting power-hitters in the women’s game. An 11th straight win of the year also means the Belarusian will return to a career-high ranking of No. 2 behind Iga Swiatek, reaping the rewards of her improved mental stability and service to emerge as a genuine threat in big tournaments. With Russian and Belarusian players only allowed to compete as individual athletes without national affiliation at Melbourne Park due Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Sabalenka also became the first neutral athlete to win a major. She dropped to the floor in delight after securing the win and walked up to Rybakina’s side of the court to give her a hug before climbing up to embrace her emotional entourage in the players’ box. “Thank you so much for an amazing atmosphere,” said Sabalenka, who received the trophy from former world No. 1 Billie Jean King. “And of course my team, the craziest team on tour, I would say. We’ve been through a lot of downs last year, we worked so hard.” “I hope next year I come back and I show you even better tennis, and you guys support me even more,” she added. Russian-born Rybakina went up 3-1 with a comfortable hold after fifth-seed Sabalenka dropped her huge serve with a double fault and sent a forehand long, but the Kazakh came under pressure and allowed her opponent to level the opening set at 4-4. Rybakina hit back immediately, however, turning up the heat in gusty conditions at Rod Laver Arena to grab another break as Sabalenka double-faulted for a fifth time, and going on to seal the set with a big serve that the Belarusian returned into the net. It was the first time that Adelaide champion Sabalenka had dropped a set in 11 matches this year and the nerves began to show just a bit, before the 24-year-old composed herself and saved two breakpoints in the opening game of the next set. Sabalenka then found a bit of consistency to break but had to overcome a wobble to grab a 4-1 lead after which she let out a huge roar and leveled the match with her 11th and 12th aces to take the match at Melbourne Park to a third set. Sabalenka served with venom and hammered deep returns in the decider to punch holes through Rybakina’s defense for a 5-3 lead. She then double-faulted on one match point and squandered two more before finally prevailing to claim the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. She walked to Rybakina’s side of the court and gave her a hug before climbing up to embrace her team in her players box. “I would like to congratulate Aryna… I know how hard you have worked for that,” said Rybakina. “Hopefully we’re going to have many more battles. “I had goosebumps when everyone was cheering for us… I’m looking forward to coming back next year… It was an amazing two weeks for me and hopefully I’m going to have the same results and even better.” – Rappler.com"

Star sniper Juami Tiongson came one point shy of his career-high and finished with 30 points on a stellar 6-of-9 clip from three and 10-of-12 on free throws, while import Jordan Williams followed up his 46-point debut with 29 points, 8 rebounds, 5 steals, and 3 rebounds. Coming off a small 72-67 lead early in the fourth quarter, Terrafirma found a much-needed spark off some stellar spurts of pressure defense and broke away with a 14-2 blitz, ending with consecutive triples from Alex Cabagnot and Tiongson for the 86-69 gap with 7:53 left to play. Although Meralco squeezed out a late 10-0 run to turn a 74-90 deficit to just 6, 84-90, with 1:25 remaining, the Dyip held firm, shutting the door on the Bolts’ comeback with a hustling Eric Camson putback off his own miss for the 92-84 lead with just 24 ticks left. “We had a good start, then in the second and third quarters, I really pushed them,” said Terrafirma head coach Johnedel Cardel in Filipino. “I told them, if I needed to slap them to wake up, I would, and it happened. But I didn’t slap them.” “I wasn’t looking at how many times they have beat us.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/donald-trump-heads-new-hampshire-south-carolina-bid-jump-start-campaign/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – Former US President Donald Trump will swing through New Hampshire and South Carolina on Saturday, January 28, in the first two stops of a presidential campaign that has largely idled since he launched his new White House bid in November. Trump will speak first at the New Hampshire Republican Party’s annual meeting in Salem before heading to Columbia, South Carolina’s capital, where he will unveil his leadership team in the state. Both states are seen as potential kingmakers, as they are among the first to hold their nominating contests. How a candidate performs there often makes or breaks their campaign. Political observers in both the Republican and Democratic parties will be keenly watching to see who shows up to support Trump at the events. Once the undisputed center of gravity in the Republican Party, an increasing number of elected officials have expressed concerns about his ability to beat Democratic President Joe Biden, if he decides to run again, as is widely expected. In New Hampshire, Republican Governor Chris Sununu has said he is having conversations about a primary bid, and many high-ranking Republicans there – including those who supported Trump previously – say publicly they are looking for an alternative. In South Carolina, where Trump will appear alongside Governor Henry McMaster and Senator Lindsey Graham, there will be a number of conspicuous absences. Among those not attending are the state party chairman, at least three Republican US representatives from the state and South Carolina US Senator Tim Scott, who has himself been floated as a potential Republican presidential candidate. Scott and others have cited scheduling conflicts. Several Republican state lawmakers decided against attending after failing to gain assurances from Trump’s team that doing so would not be considered an endorsement, according to a person with knowledge of the planning. “You know, there’s a lot of remaining appetite for Trump, and I think a lot of people still believe that Trump is being treated unfairly,” said Reese Boyd III, a Republican official from the Myrtle Beach area. “But you also see that softening from some groups.” To be sure, Trump retains a significant base of support, particularly among the grassroots. While he loses in some head-to-head polls against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another potential competitor, he wins by significant margins when poll respondents are presented with a broader field of options. Since launching his campaign in November, Trump has maintained a relatively low profile. He called multiple conservative Republicans in the US House of Representatives in early January to persuade them to vote for Kevin McCarthy, an ally, for the new Speaker. Most brushed off his entreaties, though McCarthy was elected to the position after a bruising battle. As with previous events, many Republicans will be looking at whether Trump offers a forward-looking vision or instead retreads false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The latter opinion has proven unpopular with independent voters, and political analysts say it was a factor in the Republicans’ underwhelming performance in the November congressional midterm elections. – Rappler.com"

Michico Lopez Ramos, 38, said she is doing so because she understands how it is to be jobless and with no relatives to ask help from in a foreign land. “I am doing this to help our kababayan (fellow citizens) struggling to find a job,” Ramos told Rappler. “Alam ko kasi ang feeling ng walang-wala – as in walang trabaho, walang kita, halos lahat palabas ang pera, like bayad sa bahay, sa utilities, gas, pagkain, and other bills. Wala din tutulong sa iyo kasi lahat din may kanyang-kanyang problema sa buhay,” she said. Ramos added: “Hindi naman ako mayaman, pero I want to at least be an instrument of God, give them hope and courage to start a new life again, na makatulong in my own little way to lessen their burden sa mga isipin nila sa gastusin para makabangon muli. I’ve been in that situation kaya alam ko ang pakiramdam.“ (I know how it feels to have nothing – to have no job, no savings, to face financial obligations that include rent, utilities, food, and other bills. I’ve been in that situation where nobody else could help because everyone also has problems of their own…. I am not rich, but I just want to at least be an instrument of God to give them hope and courage to start a new life again, and to help in my own little way to lessen their burden. I have been in that tight fix – that’s why I know how it feels.) Lopez said four males have so far taken refuge at the apartment unit located on the Al Rigga strip in Deira, Dubai – a Filipino enclave. She said they could stay there until they find jobs. “‘Yung isa, sa rooftop na lang daw natutulog at namamalimos sa Satwa. ‘Yung isa naman, matagal nang nagtratrabaho pero hindi [umano] pinapasuweldo ng amo, kaya ang ending, wala ding pambayad sa bahay at mapapaso na ang visa, hindi alam saan kukuha ng pambayad,” Ramos said. (One has been sleeping on rooftops, I was told, and begging in Satwa, another Filipino enclave. The other has been working for a while but was allegedly not being paid, and so he has no money to pay the rent. Worse, his visa is about to expire and he has no one to turn to for the fees.) “It’s a great feeling to be of help to people without asking for anything in return. I believe that God blesses us to bless other people. We don’t know how much our small acts of kindness mean to those we were able to help,” she added in a mix of English and the vernacular. Ramos obtained her degree in science and information technology at the Far Eastern University Diliman in 2004. It would usually take her up to two hours to commute from their home in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, to school. Going home after class would also take her that much time. She arrived in Dubai some 15 years ago and had lived through at least three visit visas, which she had to continuously renew to be able to stay in the city while looking for work. A visit visa has a maximum duration of up to three months. Her first job was as sales staff at an electronics shop, selling laptops and mobile phones. A one-bedroom apartment unit in Dubai costs from AED 38,000 to AED 48,000 a year (P563,187 to P711,394). It can be partitioned into at least five smaller rooms at AED 1,200 to AED 1,500 a month (P17,784 to P22,231). Each partitioned room can accommodate two persons sleeping in bunk beds. Ramos could have just easily rented her unit out and earn, as is the usual practice. Ramos runs Creative Group, a company she opened a few years back and now has several high-profile clients. – Rappler.com *AED 1 = P14.83"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/pdrs-innovative-business-tool-attacked-media-chilled-businesses/,['LIAN BUAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – When former president Rodrigo Duterte launched his attacks on media, his government used Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) as a tool to paint news companies like Rappler and ABS-CBN as tax evaders and foreign owned, creating in the process a chilling effect that crossed over to the business sector. In acquitting Rappler and its CEO, Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, the Philippines’ Court of Tax Appeals explained how local laws and regulations innovated to allow businesses to raise capital. One is the use of a holding company, like Rappler Holdings, which issued the PDRs to foreign investors, and the other is PDR. “It is not repugnant to the nature of a holding company to engage in financial activities to raise capital for its subsidiaries,” said the tax court, adding that the concept of a holding company is really to “raise large capital for subsidiaries that have limited access to financing or are restricted to do so by regulatory agencies for various other reasons.” The Constitution requires media companies to be 100% Filipino owned. PDR was a tool to get large capital from a foreign investor without violating this rule. PDR was a common tool not only for media companies but other large companies as well, said Francis Lim, Rappler’s lead counsel in the PDR and tax cases, and former president of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) and the Management Association of the Philippines. “It’s very common. In fact, under my watch [at the PSE], GMA Holdings listed its PDRs of GMA, the TV network. PLDT, Globe Telecom, many…some of them even listed their PDRs in the New York Stock Exchange,” said Lim. ABS-CBN also has PDRs, which were used by legislators allied with Duterte to take away the franchise of the largest TV network and keep them off the air for the first time since the Marcos dictatorship. By “weaponizing” PDRs, said Lim, investors were spooked, impacting the business sector. “I know for a fact there was a [negative] effect. It’s a very bad precedent for business. If I was the business owner and I think that if I do something that will anger the future administration, my business will be shut down, imagine the chilling effect on that,” Lim said in a mix of English and Filipino. “Cases like the one against ABS-CBN would make them a less attractive investment instrument, especially other nationalized companies like telecommunications,” he said. And if these companies have no investment, then they cannot render service, and most importantly, they cannot provide jobs. To prosecute Rappler, the BIR said that when the holding company issued a PDR, it acquired taxable income and therefore must pay income tax and value added tax. The CTA said that there was no taxable income gained in such event because PDRs are defined in Philippine regulation as having “no right of ownership over the underlying shares.” What PDR gave to foreign investors was the right to buy an underlying share compliant to laws. But because media companies should be 100% Filipino owned, Rappler’s PDR holders cannot buy any underlying share. They can only benefit from the shares of the dividend of the subsidiary. “There is nothing in the wordings of the PDR instruments and the PDR subscription agreements that would show the foreign entities Omidyar and North Base Media will become owners of the shares of stock of Rappler Inc. upon the issuance of the PDRs,” said the CTA, concluding that there was no taxable income if there was no sale in the first place. Lim said the foreign investors could also sell the PDR in the future to a Filipino investor, who would then be able to exercise the right to buy shares. “I’ve been in practice since 1981, and this is the first time I’ve seen a case like this where cases started to be filed against a company that was mentioned by no less than the President in his State of the Nation Address,” said Lim, who has had to navigate a case of his specialization but in the backdrop of free speech. What happened to Rappler, ABS-CBN, and even Philippine Daily Inquirer, which Duterte attacked on the basis of its other subsidiaries, are part of a global trend of autocratic leaders attacking the press using confusing laws such as tax and corporate. While in other countries, their congresses or parliaments are more powerful, Lim said it was crucial that the Philippines’ constitutional setup put the executive, legislative, and judiciary in co-equal status. “That’s the reason why we have a check and balance, because if the executive branch is abusing as what happened in this case, then the judiciary can check the abuses,” said Lim. “This is also where press freedom comes in because without an independent press, without a courageous press, abuses such as this will not be publicized, and if it’s kept under wraps, abuses will continue,” said Lim. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/galvez-proposed-rotc-program-timeline-full-implementation/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The proposed Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program can be fully implemented in five years, newly appointed Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Saturday, January 28. “The projected timeline from enactment of the law to initial implementation is 2-3 years, while full implementation can be done in 5 years.” The defense chief, who is also a retired military general, said the DND, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education, and other relevant agencies have already come up with the concept of how the proposed program would be implemented. “We can implement this using a ‘phased approach’ wherein we will have pilot and simulation runs in selected universities while preparing our personnel, logistical, and budgetary requirements for its full implementation,” Galvez explained. According to him, the first phase will be the preparation stage, which will include: curriculum development, selection and training of implementers, personnel, logistics, and budget planning. Also included is the “selection of pilot volunteer schools based on results of evaluation of their facilities and capacities.” Afterward, the program will be implemented in this order: The defense chief, who also oversees the military, added the Regional Community Defense Groups of the Philippine Army, Air Reserve Centers of the Philippine Air Force, and the Naval Reserve Centers of the Philippine Navy would be used to manage the ROTC program. At present, the ROTC is a voluntary program for college students that seeks to produce military reservists. It used to be mandatory but this was scrapped in 2002 following the death of Mark Welson Chua, a University of Santo Tomas student, who exposed the ROTC’s alleged corruption. The ROTC became optional through Republic Act No. 9163 or the National Service Training Program Act of 2001. The revival of mandatory ROTC came after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. pushed to make the program a requirement for senior high students during his first State of the Nation Address in 2022. Various organizations, including youth groups, have slammed the proposal, saying it would be an “added burden to the students.” Instead of the ROTC, the lower chamber passed a bill in December 2022 seeking to require college students to undergo a two-year mandatory National Citizens Service Training (NCST). The NCST program will focus on disaster response and management, survival and safety techniques, and civic duty inculcation. In his statement, Galvez also said he appreciated the “enthusiasm” of former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief turned Senator Ronaldo “Bato” dela Rosa in pushing for the ROTC. “The DND fully supports and greatly appreciates the enthusiasm of our legislators led by Sen. Ronald dela Rosa in pushing for the law, and we commit to take an active part in the legislative process through our full cooperation and inputs, whenever and wherever they are needed.” The defense chief also “assured” Dela Rosa that the DND would be ready to immediately implement the program once the law was passed. “We assure Senator dela Rosa and our distinguished lawmakers that we will be ready to start the program when the law is passed and it will be diligently implemented in coordination with our partner agencies and institutions including the private sector organizations in order to ensure its success,” Galvez said. His statement came exactly three days after Dela Rosa was annoyed during a Senate hearing that discussed the ROTC program. During the hearing, DND Undersecretary Franco Nemesio Gacal gave a reality check and said that to implement the program, the military would need to mobilize around 9,000 to 10,000 personnel for about 2,400 colleges and universities. Irked by Gacal’s remarks, Dela Rosa said he did not like the attitude of the DND official. Galvez and Dela Rosa have ties because they both worked under former president Rodrigo Duterte’s Cabinet. Dela Rosa served as Duterte’s PNP chief while Galvez was the adviser for the peace process. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/aklan-farmers-rabbit-production-food-alternative/,[],"KALIBO, Philippines –  Farmers in the province of Aklan are hoping that rabbit will become popular as food now that the Chinese Calendar has ushered in the year of the water rabbit. Local rabbit food advocate Margarito Andrade told Rappler on January 25 that farmers in Banga town, Aklan started introducing the production of rabbit in 2020 during the height of the COVID 19 pandemic. That was also around the time the Department of Agriculture started exploring the potential of systematically producing rabbit meat as an alternative source of protein. “Currently, there are hundreds of residents in Aklan who are into rabbit production. In January 2022, we counted some 400 plus breeders. Now, I estimate it to possibly reach a thousand residents,” Andrade said in a phone interview. Local farmers see rabbit production as an alternative source to boost food security and help mitigate climate change. Panay island, which includes the provinces of Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guinamas and Iloilo, and Iloilo City had scattered outbreaks in 2022 of African Swine Fever. It forced local governments to tighten borders of provinces, towns, and even barangays against the movement of pork and pork products from affected communities. Explaining how rabbits can help the environment, Andrade pointed out: “According to studies, rabbits do not emit gas in the air ,which helps heal the earth from the threat of global warming.” “Also, through proper research  and training, breeders know that rabbits only feed on dry grasses,” he added. Despite the availability of information on the internet, some breeders rely on commercial feed to feed their rabbits. The rising cost of commercial feed has discouraged some breeders, Andrade acknowledged. Rabbit is still quite pricey, retailing at around P400 per kilo in 2021 Andrade has just organized a chat group of local rabbit breeders. “When we are organized, we could then seek assistance from the Department of Agriculture,” he added Once confederated, Andrade’s group plans to organize a rabbit festival in the province. Banga Municipal Agriculture and Fisheries Council Felino Remaneses has conducted a workshop on rabbit production for farmers and fisherfolk all over province at the Aklan Provincial Food Terminal at Barangay Pook, Kalibo. “We provided rabbit lechon, for all to taste how yummy it is. It is healthier and better than eating lechon baka or lechon baboy (whole roasted cow or pig),” he said. Vicmae Macavinta, an employee of the Provincial Agriculture Office said that at first she was hesitant to eat the rabbit lechon. “But then I got curious as everybody also tasted it and found that it tastes good. I am sure to eat it again once there is an opportunity,” she told Rappler. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/chr-icc-probe-opportunity-marcos-government-demonstrate-transparency/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Human Rights has urged the Philippine government to view the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision on the drug war killings under the Duterte administration as an “opportunity” for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to demonstrate his commitment to transparency and human rights. “In the interest of justice and accountability, the CHR urges the government of the Philippines to view the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber decision as an opportunity to fulfill President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s earlier commitment in ensuring a ‘high-level of accountability’ for human issues and violations during his term,” the CHR said in a statement on Saturday, January 28. “Let this development be a chance for the Philippines to demonstrate openness and transparency as part of the fraternity of nations that values human rights and the rule of law,” it added. The ICC on Thursday, January 26, said its pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the investigation into killings under Duterte’s drug war, moving the probe to the warrants stage. The ICC had paused its investigation in November 2021 after the Philippines asked for a deferral. The Philippine government was given a chance to submit more proof that it was willing and able to genuinely investigate the killings with its own justice system. The pre-trial chamber received submissions from the Philippine government, the ICC Prosecutor, and victims. But the ICC would have deferred jurisdiction over the case if it was satisfied with the submissions. The CHR, the Philippines’ independent national human rights institution, said it extended its “openness and willingness” to assist the Marcos administration in upholding the rights and dignity of Filipinos. “CHR acknowledges that there are present efforts being done by the current administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in improving the human rights situation in the country. The ICC investigation is an opportune occasion for the present government to take the right track in upholding its human rights obligations, especially for those wronged and violated,” the CHR said. Following the ICC’s latest move, Duterte said he will not allow “foreigners” to judge him – his consistent reaction to the ICC case, even from when he was still president. Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra on Friday said the Philippines will appeal the ICC decision. On the same day, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla that the ICC was “insulting” the Philippines with its decision to resume the investigation and that government was still unwilling to cooperate with the probe. During the warrants stage, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan’s office will look for evidence to potentially request the court to issue either summons or warrants. The latest ICC information did not provide specific names, but Duterte and his allies like Dela Rosa, have been mainstays in the probe over Davao Death Squad killings and thousands of drug war deaths. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindoro-mangyan-walk-extra-mile-birth-certificate/,[],"ORIENTAL MINDORO, Philippines – Win-ay Oyonan walked by the river’s edge in Bongabong town, Oriental Mindoro. On a dirt path that led to the next village she crossed one stream and then another on August 19, 2022. She stopped only when she saw a family on the way to their farm. “Registered?” She called out in Mangyan, the language of 9,000 indigenous people in the province, to the mother holding an infant in her arms. “No. I don’t know what to call her,” the mother replied, shaking her head. The two women found a quiet corner in the shade. From an envelope, Win-ay took a piece of paper and listed down these details: mother, father, date of birth. The mother, after taking some time to think, decided to name her child after a famous actress. Win-ay wrote carefully on the form: B-E-L-L-A. That day, the child received her name. In Mindoro, the Mangyan are synonymous with walking. They say the Mangyan can walk all day. And many do. But for years, new parents and pregnant mothers living in mountain communities found it far too long and expensive to trek downhill for the most basic of rights: a legal identity. In 2019, less than half of Mangyan surveyed in the province had a birth certificate, according to a survey conducted by The Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services (IDEALS), a non-government organization that aims to increase birth registration among indigenous people on the island. The most common deterrent is the lack of funds and the distance from their homes to the municipal centers where they need to register their children. “A trip downtown costs P400 both ways,” said Win-ay, who is a member of the Buhid Mangyan ethnic group living in the municipality of Bongabong. To get to the town center from her village, Win-ay either walks or hires a habal-habal or motorcycle taxi to drive her to the municipal hall. Mangyan living farther uphill have it even harder. They make most of their trip on foot, trekking for up to five hours from the mountains before they reach a dirt road fit for vehicles. When they do take the time off, they miss out on a day of farming that would have earned them additional income — a steep price when an average Mangyan earn less than P1000 a month from farming, based on the same survey from IDEALS. Without a birth certificate, unregistered Mangyan do not technically exist according to State records. And if they do not exist, they cannot be entitled to these basic services. Years ago, the Mangyan could afford to “live and die” without so much as a birth record. But these days, birth certificates are required to go to school, access basic healthcare, and receive other government benefits. The documents are also prerequisites to apply for the State’s conditional cash transfer program (4Ps), which is a major monetary support for many Mangyan’s day-to-day living. Win-ay and several Mangyan from all over Oriental Mindoro are working to change this. She is part of a small group of Mangyan who are slowly making birth registration more accessible to their neighbors. For five years, Win-ay has served as a barangay civil registration assistant (CRA) for the Municipality of Bongabong, helping the local Municipal Civil Registrar (MCR) process applications for Mangyan living in remote communities. Win-ay had been trained by a different non-government organization to conduct similar mobile civil registration activities. So she was one of the first two contracted by their local government to help with the registration of Indigenous People. “I know everyone here” Win-ay said, sharing how fellow Mangyan from other villages have pointed neighbors with newborns to her home. Every week, she visits villages that the local registrar’s staff cannot reach. She checks and takes down details of newborns who need to be registered, and submits them to the local civil registrar, which then processes the applications and hands them back to her for distribution. Win-ay receives an honorarium depending on the number of applications she’s facilitated. She estimated the number of Mangyan she has helped register at almost 1,000. Her work takes her as close as the next village or to mountains as far as six hours away from home. “I go anywhere I need to go. Near or far, whether or not I have someone to go with me,” Win-ay said. Bongabong, a sprawling municipality of rivers and hills, was the first town in Oriental Mindoro to directly integrate katutubo, the Filipino word for indigenous people, into their civil registration system. Around 9,000 Mangyan live in the area, spread out across three barangays. Bongabong Municipal Civil Registrar (MCR) Renel Malacapo, whose office is in charge of processing birth certificates and all civil registration documents within the town, said the idea to incorporate Mangyan as partners first came to him in 2017. “We used to conduct mobile civil registration in communities, but whenever we’d arrive, Mangyan would prioritize buying goods [over registering]. They were too shy to approach us,” he recalled in Filipino. “[Now] Our agents go to their houses and interview katutubos at home. [It’s better this way] because it’s hard to ask katutubos to go to activities during the day, when they need to work. Mangyan also need to make a living and eat,” he said. – Rappler.com (Amanda Lingao is a writer and a project development officer for IDEALS, Inc., a human rights NGO based in Metro Manila.)"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/department-migrant-workers-assess-ofw-welfare-kuwait-following-jullebee-ranara-killing/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) will send a team to examine the situation of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Kuwait following the killing of Filipino domestic worker Jullebee Ranara. The OFW was allegedly killed by the 17-year-old son of her employer, whom she had described to her family as “cruel,” according to Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople. The minor has since been arrested and put under Kuwait police custody. “The task at hand is a directive from the secretary to send a fact-finding team to Kuwait to ascertain [and] take stock of the welfare cases there, and to find ways and means to address these welfare cases either by filing cases in Kuwait if need be, or filing cases in labor tribunals and authorities there,” DMW Undersecretary Hans Cacdac said in a media briefing on Saturday, January 28. Some members of the fact-finding team include Philippine social welfare attache Bernard Bonina and lawyer Geraldine Mendez, who is with the DMW’s anti-illegal recruitment branch. “The findings may result in policy reforms and even, if needed, personnel changes based on the performance audit that will be undertaken by this fact-finding team,” said Ople. Ranara’s remains were brought back to the Philippines on Friday night, January 27. Ople, who personally observed burns on Ranara’s body, said that the body was brought to a funeral parlor somewhere in Cavite City. The National Bureau of Investigation was to have begun its autopsy on the body on Saturday morning. Officials from the DMW accompanied Ranara’s siblings and cousins, who were there to receive the OFW’s remains on Friday night. The chairpersons of the Senate and House migrant workers committees, Senator Raffy Tulfo and Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, respectively, were also there for Ranara’s repatriation. Ople said she witnessed the “heartbreaking” reunion of the family with Ranara. In a statement released on Saturday night, Cacdac said Ople had ordered the review of bilateral labor agreements between the Philippines and Kuwait. “Ang direktiba ni Secretary Toots ay napapanahon nang irepaso, to revisit, review itong bilateral labor agreement na ito at paigtingin ang proteksiyon sa mga OFWs (Secretary Toots’ directive was to review, to revisit this bilateral labor agreement and strengthen the protection of our OFWS),” Cacdac explained. The DMW, according to Cacdac, will also review the recruitment process and standards in hiring OFWs in Kuwait. “At sabay nito ay pinatitingnan din ni Secretary Toots iyong recruitment standards para paigtingin iyong safe and ethical recruitments standards para sa mga OFWs to Kuwait, na masiguro natin, halimbawa, iyong mga agencies with clean track records lamang ang makakapag-deploy ng mga OFWs to Kuwait.” (And along with this, Secretary Toots also ordered a look into the recruitment standards to improve the safe and ethical recruitments standards for our OFWS in Kuwait, so we can ensure, for example, that only agencies with clean track records can deploy OFWs to Kuwait.) DMW Undersecretary Bernard Olalia reported that the DMW has issued a preventive suspension against Ranara’s employer, which means they cannot hire Filipino workers. Olalia said that the preventive suspension prompts proceedings that will eventually lead to a final decision for permanent blacklisting. Ranara’s recruitment agencies in the Philippines and Kuwait will also be subject to sanctions. Olalia said that the department is preparing to file a recruitment violation case against Catalyst International Manpower Services Company, and its Kuwait-based counterpart, Platinum International Office for Recruitment of Domestic Manpower. Olalia said that the “most important” obligation of the recruitment agencies is the continuous monitoring of the workers. He said that they are obligated to check in with their OFWs regularly should they have concerns with their workplace, such as if they are being harmed. “Based on the investigation, this was not followed. We did not receive any report in our OFW welfare monitoring system, and we did not receive a report that [Ranara] had an issue with the 17-year-old,” Olalia said in a mix of English and Filipino. The DMW is set to meet with local recruitment agencies sending household service workers to Kuwait on Monday, January 30. On Friday, Senator Tulfo pushed for a total deployment ban on Kuwait, which he said would send “a very strong message.” The Kuwaiti government should also issue a public apology, and not just an apology to Ranara’s family, Tulfo said. “After [imposing] the total deployment ban, that’s the only time we can sit down with them, in bilateral talks, but on our terms. We should give conditions to them. And if they want OFWs, they must follow our conditions,” Tulfo said in a mix of English and Filipino. Pressed by reporters on Saturday regarding the DMW’s decision to stay firm on not imposing a deployment ban, Ople said that it is in the country’s interest to prioritize pursuing labor diplomacy. “Pag nag-impose ka kasi ng deployment ban, you are sending a message that ‘Kuwait is not suitable to our workers.’ Parang sinasabi mo, ‘Galit-galit tayo.’ ‘Di ba? ‘Hindi kami magpapadala sa inyo.’ And naiintindihan namin na mayroong ganoon dahil nga sobrang galit natin sa nangyari, ‘yun ang gustong gawin,” said Ople. “‘Yung sa amin naman, mayroon namang paraan para mag-usap. Ngayon, ang dapat ayusin, ‘yung agenda ng pag-uusapan. Sa tingin namin, mas advantageous sa mga workers natin na nandoon…na patuloy kaming nag-uusap with Kuwait,” she added. (When you impose a deployment ban, you are sending a message that “Kuwait is not suitable to our workers.” It’s like you are saying, “We have beef with each other.” Right? “We will not send you workers.” And we understand why there are calls like that because of our anger over what happened. For us, there are ways to dialogue. Now, we just have to fix the agenda of discussion points. We think it is more advantageous to our workers there…that we continue speaking to Kuwait.) Ople said that some factors that would push the Philippines to impose a ban include consensus between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the DMW, considering what is in the national interest, the advantages and disadvantages of OFWs there and who aspire to work there, and the host government’s willingness to dialogue. “It cannot be a product of emotions and political acoustics because workers are involved. That’s why we at the department are careful,” said Ople, aware that the decision has caused criticism. The Kuwaiti government has expressed its sympathies and signified its drive to pursue justice for Ranara’s case based on its communications to the Philippine government, as released by the DMW. There are more than 200 OFWs staying in shelters in Kuwait who have active welfare cases. Ople said the department has yet to come up with a threshold figure that would indicate the appropriate time to impose a deployment ban. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/search-on-missing-yvonette-plaza-murder-suspects/,[],"DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – Authorities are searching for three of the 10 suspects in the controversial Yvonette Chua Plaza murder case. The suspects went missing before the police filed a murder complaint against them and seven others, including the alleged mastermind, former Presidential Security Group (PSG) chief Brigadier General Jesus Durante III. “As far as I know, three suspects are missing,” Davao Region police chief Brigadier General Benjamin Silo Jr. on Friday, January 27. Army officials suspected that the soldiers’ disappearance had something to do with the murder, Silo said. Those missing include two soldiers and a civilian who served as a military man Friday. Major Eudisan Gultiano, the spokesperson of the Special Investigation Task Group Yvonette Plaza, said Private 1st class Romart Longakit went missing and Private 1st class Rolly Cabal has gone AWOL. “Efforts are ongoing to locate the other two respondents (Longakit and Cabal),” said Philippine Army spokesperson Colonel Medel Aguilar on Friday. The whereabouts of a third suspect, Noel Japitan – a civilian who served soldiers as a “striker” or sidekick – is also unknown. A police matrix released this week showed that Japitan, alias Entod, was the man allegedly ordered to repaint and dismantle parts of a motorcycle used in the bloody gun attack on December 29, outside Plaza’s home in Davao City. Durante, who was the commander of the Army’s 1001st Brigade at the time of the murder, and at least seven others are respondents in a murder complaint submitted by the police to Davao prosecutors on Wednesday, January 25. Aside from murder, the Army general, his former deputy commander, Colonel Michael Licyayo, and Staff Sergeant Gilbert Plaza, were also accused of obstruction of justice along with two John Does. Except for Longakit and Cabal, all the identified soldiers have been placed under military custody, including confessed hitman Sergeant Delfin Sialsa Jr., and Corporal Adrian Cachero who allegedly drove a motorcycle used in the shocking attack. Silo said Longakit was vital to the Plaza murder case, and was “the biggest link.” He did not give more details. Based on the matrix shown by the police, Longakit and Cabal served as lookouts for a team allegedly led on the ground by Staff Sergeant Plaza. The staff sergeant was the same man who was allegedly ordered by Durante’s deputy commander to burn the murder victim’s handbag, cellphone, a credit card, and an identification card, based on the extrajudicial confession of Sergeant Sialsa, the self-confessed gunman. Silo said the enlisted Army soldiers – including Longakit before he went missing – had provided authorities with sufficient information and pieces of evidence. “The suspects and I talked in my office. They told me that, after they executed extrajudicial confessions, they were able to sleep well,” said Silo. Sialsa and Cachero, who allegedly rode a motorcycle in tandem during the attack, had executed extrajudicial confessions, showed the police matrix. “We have very strong evidence, and there are more to come to meet the challenge of establishing a probable cause,” said Silo. The 38-year-old Plaza, a pharmaceutical firm representative, businesswoman, and model, just stepped out of her car and was near the gate of her rented house when she was shot at point-blank range in the village of Mintal in Davao’s Tugbok district, just two nights before New Year’s Eve. None of the suspects have responded to the accusations after the police filed the complaint on Wednesday. But Durante earlier strongly denied having any hand in the murder of Plaza, whom he said was his close friend. He had also condoled with her family. Durante, who led the PSG during part of the Duterte administration – from February 2020 to August 2021 – had also denied beating up Plaza. Plaza had posted photos of her facial injuries and alleged in a social media post months before her murder, claiming, “Jes Durante did this to me.” Durante had claimed that Plaza had retracted her accusation long before the vigilante-style killing. The general’s claim could not be independently verified as of posting time. In a January 27 statement, the Army said it was saddened by the alleged involvement of soldiers in the Plaza murder case. “Through the years, the AFP has always shown its respect to human rights and that it will never condone any unlawful act of its members. Once again, we have demonstrated this by the cooperation we have extended to the SITG Plaza in the conduct of the investigation,” said Army spokesperson Aguilar. Davao Region police said several suspects first confessed to the crime before a military board of inquiry, while the National Bureau of Investigation’s digital forensics work allowed them to build their case and file the complaint less than a month after the murder. Aguilar said the Army has taken proactive measures to further help in the resolution of the case. Durante, Licyayo, and three enlisted Army personnel under military custody “will be made available to face the charges that will be filed against them,” Aguilar said. He said the Army was also conducting a parallel investigation into the respondents’ possible violations of Articles of War and existing Armed Forces regulations without prejudice to the ongoing criminal proceedings. The Army also extended its sympathies to Plaza’s family. “To the family of Yvonette, we feel your grief and pain. Please accept our condolences and we are one with you in praying for her eternal peace,” said Aguilar. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/top-united-states-treasury-official-nelson-to-warn-turkey-united-arab-emirates-sanctions-evasion/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – The US Treasury Department’s top sanctions official on a trip to Turkey and the Middle East next week will warn countries and businesses that they could lose US market access if they do business with entities subject to US curbs as Washington cracks down on Russian attempts to evade sanctions imposed over its war in Ukraine. Brian Nelson, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, will travel to Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey from January 29 to February 3, and meet with government officials as well as businesses and financial institutions to reiterate that Washington will continue to aggressively enforce its sanctions, a Treasury spokesperson told Reuters. “Individuals and institutions operating in permissive jurisdictions risk potentially losing access to US markets on account of doing business with sanctioned entities or not conducting appropriate due diligence,” the spokesperson said. While in the region, Nelson will discuss Treasury’s efforts to crack down on Russian efforts to evade sanctions and export controls imposed over its brutal war against Ukraine, Iran’s destabilizing activity in the region, illicit finance risks undermining economic growth, and foreign investment. The trip marks the latest visit to Turkey by a senior Treasury official to discuss sanctions, following a string of warnings last year by Treasury and Commerce Department officials, as Washington ramped up pressure on Ankara to ensure enforcement of US curbs on Russia. Nelson’s trip coincides with a period of strained ties between the United States and Turkey as the two NATO allies disagree over a host of issues. Most recently, Turkey’s refusal to green-light the NATO bids of Sweden and Finland has troubled Washington, while Ankara is frustrated that its request to buy F-16 fighter jets is increasingly linked to whether the two Nordic countries can join the alliance. Nelson will visit Ankara, the Turkish capital, and financial hub Istanbul on February 2 to 3. He will warn businesses and banks that they should avoid transactions related to potential dual-use technology transfers, which could ultimately be used by Russia’s military, the spokesperson said. Dual-use items can have both commercial and military applications. Washington and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions targeting Moscow since the invasion, which has killed and wounded thousands and reduced Ukrainian cities to rubble. Turkey has condemned Russia’s invasion and sent armed drones to Ukraine. At the same time, it opposes Western sanctions on Russia and has close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, its Black Sea neighbors. It has also ramped up trade and tourism with Russia. Some Turkish firms have purchased or sought to buy Russian assets from Western partners pulling back due to the sanctions, while others maintain large assets in the country. But Ankara has pledged that international sanctions will not be circumvented in Turkey. Washington is also concerned about evasion of US sanctions on Iran. The United States last month imposed sanctions on prominent Turkish businessman Sitki Ayan and his network of firms, accusing him of acting as a facilitator for oil sales and money laundering on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. While in the United Arab Emirates, Nelson will note the “poor sanctions compliance” in the country, the spokesperson said. Washington has imposed a series of sanctions on United Arab Emirates-based companies over Iran-related sanctions evasion and on Thursday designated a UAE-based aviation firm over support to Russian mercenary company the Wagner Group, which is fighting in Ukraine. – Rappler.com"

Klay Thompson chipped in 29 points and Donte DiVincenzo matched Curry with 11 of Golden State’s 40 assists, helping the Warriors win a second straight to complete a three-game homestand. Fred VanVleet had 28 points, Scottie Barnes 24, and Pascal Siakam 21 for the Raptors, who lost OG Anunoby to a left-wrist injury in the second quarter. A tightly contested matchup of 2019 NBA finalists was separated by just 2 points in the Warriors’ favor, 107-105, after VanVleet buried a three-pointer with 6:32 to go. But Golden State, which shot 55.6%, wore down the visitors with continual scoring, with Thompson adding two three-pointers and Curry and DiVincenzo one apiece down the stretch, helping the Warriors pull away. Curry, who also had 7 rebounds, shot 13-for-21 and 4-for-8 on three-pointers for the Warriors, who completed a season-series sweep over the club that denied them a three-peat in 2019. Thompson had a game-high six triples to account for a majority of his 29 points, leading the way as Golden State went 18-for-43 (41.9%) from beyond the arc. Thompson also grabbed 8 rebounds, tying Kevon Looney for team-high honors. Jonathan Kuminga added 15 points, DiVincenzo and Looney 12 apiece and JaMychal Green 10 for the Warriors, who were playing without Andrew Wiggins, out with an illness. Draymond Green added 7 to Golden State’s assist total as the league leaders in assists per game reached 40 for the first time this season. Green also had 7 rebounds and 5 points. Gary Trent Jr. and Precious Achiuwa had 17 points apiece for the Raptors, who saw a two-game winning streak end despite shooting a respectable 45.5%.

https://www.rappler.com/science/earth-space/asteroid-2023-passed-earth-why-that-is-exciting/,[],"There are hundreds of millions of asteroids in our Solar System, which means new asteroids are discovered quite frequently. It also means close encounters between asteroids and Earth are fairly common. Some of these close encounters end up with the asteroid impacting Earth, occasionally with severe consequences. A recently discovered asteroid, named 2023 BU, has made the news it passed very close to Earth. Discovered on Saturday, January 21, by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov in Crimea, 2023 BU passed only about 3,600 kilometers from the surface of Earth (near the southern tip of South America) six days later on January 27. That distance is just slightly farther than the distance between Perth and Sydney, and is only about 1% the distance between Earth and our Moon. The asteroid also passed through the region of space that contains a significant proportion of the human-made satellites orbiting Earth. All this makes 2023 BU the fourth-closest known asteroid encounter with Earth, ignoring those that have actually impacted the planet or our atmosphere. Read more: NASA’s asteroid deflection mission was more successful than expected. An expert explains how 2023 BU is unremarkable, other than that it passed so close to Earth. The diameter of the asteroid is estimated to be just 4–8 meters, which is on the small end of the range of asteroid sizes. There are likely hundreds of millions of such objects in our Solar System, and it is possible 2023 BU has come close to Earth many times before over the millennia. Until now, we have been oblivious to the fact. In context, on average a 4-meter-diameter asteroid will impact Earth every year and an 8-meter-diameter asteroid every five years or so (see the infographic below). Asteroids of this size pose little risk to life on Earth when they hit, because they largely break up in the atmosphere. They produce spectacular fireballs, and some of the asteroid may make it to the ground as meteorites. Now that 2023 BU has been discovered, its orbit around the Sun can be estimated and future visits to Earth predicted. It is estimated there is a 1 in 10,000 chance 2023 BU will impact Earth sometime between 2077 and 2123. So, we have little to fear from 2023 BU or any of the many millions of similar objects in the Solar System. Asteroids need to be greater than 25 meters in diameter to pose any significant risk to life in a collision with Earth; to challenge the existence of civilization, they’d need to be at least a kilometer in diameter. It is estimated there are fewer than 1,000 such asteroids in the Solar System, and could impact Earth every 500,000 years. We know about more than 95% of these objects. Read more: Astronomers have detected another ‘planet killer’ asteroid. Could we miss one coming our way? 2023 BU was the fourth closest pass by an asteroid ever recorded. The three closer passes were by very small asteroids discovered in 2020 and 2021 (2021 UA, 2020 QG and 2020 VT). Asteroid 2023 BU and countless other asteroids have passed very close to Earth during the nearly five billion years of the Solar System’s existence, and this situation will continue into the future. What has changed in recent years is our ability to detect asteroids of this size, such that any threats can be characterized. That an object roughly five meters in size can be detected many thousands of kilometers away by a very dedicated amateur astronomer shows that the technology for making significant astronomical discoveries is within reach of the general public. This is very exciting. Amateurs and professionals can together continue to discover and categorize objects, so threat analyses can be done. Another very exciting recent development came last year, by the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which successfully collided a spacecraft into an asteroid and changed its direction. DART makes plausible the concept of redirecting an asteroid away from a collision course with Earth, if a threat analysis identifies a serious risk with enough warning. – The Conversation | Rappler.com Steven Tingay is a John Curtin Distinguished Professor (Radio Astronomy) at Curtin University.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/drag-too-political-drag-den-philippines-queens/,['AMANDA T. LAGO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The phrase “drag is political” has been thrown around so much in recent years, but never has it been more true than on recently concluded drag reality show Drag Den Philippines. Arguably, no other drag show has leaned in to drag’s political roots as hard as Drag Den has. While other shows highlight the silliness, glamour, and entertainment value of drag, Drag Den did not hold back from pushing the art form’s ability to start conversations on important social issues. Sociopolitical commentary is woven into the show’s DNA – from host Manila Luzon’s closing spiels that throw shade at oppressive systems, to challenges that push the competing drag queens to speak up, whether through their larger-than-life looks or their performances. In the first episode alone, we see Lady Gagita dissing the Pharmally scandal by wearing a giant face shield, which she dubbed “the national headband.” In the episode that followed, the queens were tasked to do a comedy sketch about Philippine politics, and they turned up as every politician stereotype imaginable. In episode six, not at all subtly titled “Drag is Political,” the contenders had to wear their best protest fashion. In the same episode, they had to speak up on their advocacies – from trans rights, to ending bullying. Outspoken as the show and its queens are, it comes as no surprise that not everyone would agree with them. On Twitter, some viewers asked if the show was getting “too political.” As far as the queens are concerned, there’s no such thing as “too political.” For contender Pura Luka Vega, being outspoken is par for the course when it comes to drag. “It’s not something to be shocked about, when drag queens become political. the act of putting on makeup, being loud and proud and out there is already political,” she said at a Drag Den press conference on Tuesday, January 24. Meanwhile, NAIA Black, who was crowned the competition’s winner on Thursday, January 26, said that it’s about redirecting the attention that they get as performers to worthy causes. Before the show aired, NAIA, then a student at the University of the Philippines, became known for her Tiktok videos where she debunked Martial Law myths dressed in full drag. Now with the title of “Drag Supreme” and a bigger platform, she shows no signs of stopping. “ As drag queens we do command so much attention, and I feel like that attention can be used for the greater good and to further platforms and advocacies that we need in this society. As drag queens, maganda na nga kami, may advocacy pa (we’re not only beautiful, we also have an advocacy), like beauty queens as well,” she said. She added that the community built around drag makes it easier to raise your voice. “I think here in the Philippines, there is really a culture to silence dissent. So drag in itself as queer people doing this, it’s truly a protest and you know we learn to stand by each other. It’s easier to be together,” she said. “It’s like a rally almost, when all the Drag Den queens are together with the cast and crew, it’s really a rally.” “It’s hard to fight when you’re alone, but when we’re together as a family, it’s so much easier to…talk shit,” she laughed. That being said, as contender Lady Gagita pointed out, being outspoken also comes with its challenges. Facing criticisms and bashers online is inevitable when they speak up. “Hindi naman talaga maiiwasan ‘yung pressure, lalo na kung ang country natin is nahahati sa dalawang sides. And of course there is always the good side, there is always an evil side. So nagkakaroon talaga kami ng bashers online, nagkakaroon talaga kami ng detractors online, so ang pinaka-ano ko na lang diyan is, we will just stick to the truth,” she explained. (We can’t avoid pressure, especially if our country is divided into two sides. And of course there is always the good side, there is always an evil side. So we really face bashers online, we face detractors online. My take on that is, we will just stick to the truth.) Beyond the signal boost that drag provides, the art form itself – blending fashion, visual art, comedy, and theater – lends itself well to all forms of dissent, allowing even the softest voices to be heard. “For someone like me who is soft spoken and an introvert, I love the way that drag for me serves as this sort of medium to not verbally necessarily but to somehow deliver messages through visuals,” said contender Aries Night. Ultimately, drag also empowers the artists themselves. “Besides sa pagiging political, naging vocal ako dahil sa drag (Aside from being political, I became vocal through drag),” said finalist Shewarma, who shared that it was in drag that she was able to come out to her family. “So for me, super powerful ng drag kasi ‘pag naka-drag ako, kaya ko sabihin lahat (drag is super powerful, because when I’m in drag, I can say anything),” she said.

A state of emergency remained in place in the city of 1.6 million people on New Zealand’s north island as the rains eased after Friday’s flooding in the north, northwest and west. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, less than a week in office, flew by helicopter over the city before touring flood-hit homes. “The level of devastation in some areas is considerable,” Hipkins told reporters, describing the event as “unprecedented” in recent memory. Daylight revealed the impact of the storm, caused by warm air descending from the tropics, sparking heavy rain and thunderstorms, said Auckland Emergency Management, part of the city’s council. “Auckland was clobbered on Friday – Auckland’s wettest day on record – and today we start the clean-up,” the agency’s duty controller, Andrew Clark, said in a statement, urging caution for residents returning home to survey flood damage. While heavy rain had eased, another period of downpours was possible on Sunday, the national weather forecaster said. Showers were “dotted around Auckland” with some heavy west of the city, Auckland Emergency Management tweeted, while warning residents to “stay safe” amid the emergency. “We’re not out of this yet.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-resonates-diverse-audience/,[],"LOS ANGELES, Jan 27 (Reuters) – When Everything Everywhere All at Once was released in March 2022, co-director Daniel Kwan wasn’t sure if audiences would connect with the film and its multiverse premise, but they did. “We tried to make a movie that everyone can relate with, but we thought we’d fail,” said Kwan, who worked with co-creator Daniel Scheinert. “But it turns out we didn’t, like literally everybody has something they can relate with.” It appears Hollywood can relate too. The A24 film garnered more Oscar nominations this week than any other film and is headed back to 1,400 theaters nationwide on Friday after earning 104.1 million globally. The motion picture is up for 11 Oscars at the March 12 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Lead Actress for Michelle Yeoh. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu are vying for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, while Ke Huy Quan is a favorite for Best Supporting Actor. Everything Everywhere All at Once follows Evelyn Wang, portrayed by Yeoh, a Chinese American immigrant struggling with her taxes, her relationship with her family and her overall life. Then she discovers she can traverse parallel universes as different versions of herself to save the multiverse, and possibly her family bonds. Yeoh, who already won a Golden Globe for the role, said even after pouring love and collaboration into the movie, one never knows how it will fare. “Once it is all done and you put it out to the world, there is no control of how it will be received, and I think sometimes it’s the alignment of the stars,” said the Malaysian actress. Kwan believes that without Yeoh, the film would not have been the success it is. He said that she pulled other cast and crew members in like a magnet when they weren’t sure what the project would look like. Hsu plays one of the film’s most complex characters, as both Evelyn’s daughter, Joy, and the multiverse’s villain, Jobu. She said it was a role of a lifetime and a total blast. “I remember filming the hallway scene where we’re introduced to Jobu for the first time,” Hsu said. “And I’m going through all these costumes, I’m like doing kung-fu, I’m like blowing up a cop’s face into confetti.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-hopelessness-impact-economy-self-harm-suicide/,['RALF RIVAS'],"Trigger warning: This article contains references to suicide MANILA, Philippines – Just days after Merlita Gallardo revealed in a Senate hearing that her husband, an onion farmer, took his own life in 2021 because an armyworm infestation had buried them in debt, cops came knocking on her door. The police went to the widow’s home in Bayambang, Pangasinan, eight times in a span of two days, even as late as 11 pm. They asked her to sign a statement recanting her Senate testimony. Police authorities also prepared an affidavit, allegedly asking her to change her husband’s cause of death. “I was scared because they kept coming back. I was worried,” Gallardo told DZBB. The case of Gallardo’s husband is just one of five recorded suicides in the town, according to Elvin Laceda, national president of the Young Farmers Challenge Club of the Philippines, who also testified before the Senate committee on food and agriculture last January 16. “I hope her story is never repeated among other farmers,” Laceda said. Prior to the repeated police visits to Gallardo’s home, Bayambang Mayor Niña Jose-Quiambao disputed what some lawmakers dubbed as the onion suicides. Jose-Quiambao cited data from the town’s health unit and police station, showing that there were no reports of multiple incidents of suicide amid skyrocketing onion prices in 2022. The mayor, however, recognized the death of Gallardo’s husband in 2021. The police eventually apologized to Gallardo for causing fear, and said that they had no ill intention and simply wanted to validate the string of suicide incidents. The incident in Pangasinan is perhaps the most extreme case that illustrates the disjoint between the Philippines’ glowing economic growth figures and the psychologically-challenging realities on the ground. It also reflects how ill-prepared the government is in handling a mental health crisis. The Marcos administration’s economic team may have recently boasted that it exceeded its growth targets in 2022 at 7.6% – so far the highest in Asia – but sociologists and mental health workers are raising the alarm of a possibly dangerous contagion that could linger amid the pandemic. In an economy still struggling to cope with inflation and mismanagement that often leads to financial losses of the poorest in society, the Philippine government cannot afford an inflation of hopelessness. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that suicide incidents rose 25.7% to 3,529 in 2020, the 27th leading cause of death during the first year of the pandemic and the peak of the global recession. The figure is 34% higher than the average recorded from 2015 to 2020. (READ: Filipinos face the mental toll of the COVID-19 pandemic) It is difficult to determine what drove people to end their lives during this period, as the PSA only recorded the cause of death in death certificates. The accuracy of what death certificates indicate can also be questioned, as suicide is often taboo. Suicides may therefore be grossly underreported, given the stigma. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have likewise cautioned against attributing suicide to any single reason on trigger. Suicide is always a confluence of factors. Economic hardships are just one of the factors that may increase the risk of suicide. Understanding how recessions and economic factors increase the risk of suicides is also tricky, as few social scientists, other than those in the field of psychology, have studied it in the Philippines. Mark Quintos, among the few sociologists who have focused on suicidology in the Philippines, noted that sociological research on the topic is inherently difficult, partly due to the stigma of the act in a predominantly Christian society. Death certificates can sometimes hide this as well. Moreover, current literature is youth-focused, as datasets about the younger population are more easily accessible. These factors have effectively limited the understanding of suicide in the country. Moreover, inquiries on the phenomenon of suicide are also often approached from a psychological perspective. “The DSM (Diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders) sees suicide primarily as a result of psychiatric diagnoses such as major depressive disorder. Suicide, consequently, has been considered a mental problem, and efforts to resolve the problem focus on counseling or cognitive therapy. While there is merit in the approach used by our psychologist [colleagues], the perception that suicide is a mental health concern alone is very wanting,” Quintos said. While Philippine data remain scarce, Quintos cited data from the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention that around 54% of people in the US who died by suicide did not have a known mental health condition. “This could either mean that they were undiagnosed prior to their death, or that there was nothing to diagnose and their suicide, rather than a mere mental health condition, is a consequence of bigger social forces at play,” he said. From his own research, Quintos said that an adverse experience of being deprived of something that is needed or wanted, brought about by poverty, increases the risk of suicide. He also emphasized that poverty does not directly lead to suicides. “Poverty, being a long-standing problem in the country, is already accepted as a normal part of the Filipino experience. Even among poor Filipino households. This is properly encapsulated in the quote that Filipinos often abide by: ‘Hindi mo kasalanan na ipinanganak kang mahirap, ngunit kasalanan mo kung mamamatay kang mahirap (It’s not your fault that you were born poor, but it’s your fault if you die poor),’” Quintos said. Quintos added that onion farmers strive daily despite their poverty and hopes that their destiny will soon turn around. But when capital was diminished, frustration must have been too much to bear, as it also effectively took away control of their own destiny. There is also the possibility of other sources of frustration piling up, such as the frustration of no longer finding meaning in the livelihood that they have chosen, as well as the frustration of not being able to adequately provide for their families. Quintos also warned that one case of suicide can produce “social currents,” characterized as great emotional movements fueled by emotions such as indignation, pity, or misery. “It is as if we are swept up by the emotions caused by the act, and we are pushed to do the same. We sometimes also call this contagion – wherein people, upon being exposed to a particular emotional stimulus such as suicide – tend to become influenced to do or engage in the same. This could explain why areas wherein a suicide has happened has a higher risk of having more suicide occurences. Indeed, in my studies, exposure to suicide is a consistent risk factor for one’s own tendency to engage in suicidal behavior,” he said. Richthofen de Jesus, clinical psychologist of Empath, said that people may imitate self-destructive behavior because of vicarious learning. “When a behavior is reinforced, if one sees someone being freed from debt by committing suicide, it can be imitated. It’s not automatic, but it increases the risk. Not all poor people commit suicide, of course. The personality type and coping mechanism are key factors in any decision-making and how people make sense of their situation,” De Jesus warned. It’s hard to imagine the possibility of such a destructive social contagion, especially with economic numbers showing recovery. The Philippines’ GDP growth surpassed the target at 7.6%, when government only aimed for at most 7.5%, primarily driven by household consumption. Filipinos were able to consume more despite inflation surging to as high as 8.1% in 2022. Unemployment is also at an all-time low at 4.2% in November 2022, indicating that there are more employed Filipinos now than before the onset of the pandemic. But these figures in 2022 do not tell the whole story. For instance, farm output shrank 0.1% in 2022, the third consecutive year of contraction. This shows that while the services and industry sectors have reaped the benefits of the global economic reopening, onion farmers and many others in agriculture are still struggling to claw out of the pandemic’s financial impact. Moreover, the country’s underemployment rate remained at double-digits at 14.4%, indicating that while more people found jobs, these jobs are of questionable quality and people need more hours of work to earn what’s needed to make ends meet. The latest consumer expectations survey of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) revealed that Filipinos initially dipped into savings to fund the recent pickup in expenditure, but have since diverted funds to rebuild decimated savings. The survey also indicated that households are tightening their belts after spending in 2022, and taking on less loans. ING Bank senior economist Nicholas Mapa earlier noted that this is an effect of the BSP’s interest rate hikes, which were done to anchor inflation. Mapa also noted that in 2023, households will rebuild their savings and the so-called revenge spending will be reversed. Inflation will also remain elevated in 2023, further straining efforts to save and afford basic necessities. The struggle to balance personal finances has also been observed by psychologists among their patients. De Jesus said that during the pandemic, there were more patients who discontinued therapy sessions to siphon finances to other needs. The issue of debt has also been repeatedly cited as a stress point. De Jesus said that poor people, like farmers who get into debt first before they can start working, have an increased risk of self-destructive behavior. “The common question is, ‘When will this end? Can I pay this off? What is the timeline?’ But as the pressure builds up repetitively, the person is not just seeing any sign of recovery,” De Jesus said. For people to cope with debt-related frustration, De Jesus said that their support system should not downplay the struggles. “Sometimes, people that you talk to about problems, because of the repetitive nature, they lose interest. And when you lose social support, you become crippled,” De Jesus said. For Quintos, he sees better working conditions, not just mental health seminars, as a solution to a dangerous social contagion. “In sociological literature, when people are frustrated, their response is to commit aggression. Suicide is just one side of the coin, with the other being homicide,” he said. Quintos added: “In cultures wherein people are taught that their frustrations are due to their own faults, the tendency is for this aggression to be directed inward: They kill themselves. In cultures wherein people are taught that their frustrations are caused by forces outside of themselves, and where they see themselves as victims of these forces, they tend to aggress in an outward manner: killing other people in the process.” – Rappler.com The Department of Health, through the National Center for Mental Health, has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/newspoint-the-davos-offensive-ferdinand-marcos-jr/,[],"I wondered how the World Economic Forum came to bring itself to invite and listen presumably to Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The annual forum is supposed to assemble, in Davos, Switzerland, many of the “foremost” leaders of nations and sectors of society with the expectation that they would contribute to discussions aimed at “improving the state of the world.” But then I realized the forum also offers, necessarily, an exploitable platform for lobbying. Oh, and did Marcos exploit it! He flew to Davos on a big PR offensive – naturally at the taxpayer’s expense – bringing a reported entourage of 70, which dwarfed every one of the delegations, even outnumbering some of them combined. And the number does not yet include his security detail and technical-support staff. I don’t know who among the Philippine delegates qualified as “foremost” personages; some of them were more like hangers-on, if not downright infamous characters. Marcos himself falls into the last category, being an heir to the plunder perpetrated during his father’s dictatorship (1972-1986). Switzerland itself should feel discomforted by Marcos’s presence: it was in one of its banks that his family hid some of its loot. In any case, going by the absence, so far as I could tell, of any mention of him in the news, except here at home, where its own media covered him dutifully, it appears Marcos played an obscure part at the forum. To be sure, being at the forum, being there at the invitation of the forum’s founder no less, had news value in itself. Never mind how he wangled the invitation; it opened for him an opportunity to make a pitch for his nation on the world stage. The privilege, however, only proved indulgent; true to character, Marcos was clueless, pretentious, deluded, self-interested. He exposed himself shooting his mouth off on three main issues he chose to address. To suit his escapist non-position, he oversimplified the trouble in the West Philippine Sea as a “conflict” between the United States and China. “I don’t work for either,” he said, altogether ignoring the facts that inform the issue. The sea was the object of territorial dispute between China and the Philippines. They had agreed to arbitration, but China bellicosely refused to accept the unfavorable ruling. Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos’s predecessor, did not himself say he worked for China, but gave in all the same. China has since had a run of the sea, monopolizing its resources and, backed by a dedicated sea and air force, dictating its use as international waterways, an arrangement the U.S. questions. Marcos has allowed the treasonous arrangement to continue, telling what audiences he could herd at Davos that the situation “is dynamic…constantly in flux.” That’s the description he uses routinely to justify his unwillingness to drive away the Chinese encroachers. In the gathering global economic crisis, due to the COVID pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine, the recovery of the West Philippine Sea becomes a matter of desperate need for its marine and mineral wealth. Choosing to spare China, however, Marcos is pushing a diversionary alternative: a sovereign wealth fund. At Davos, he promoted the idea to investors he was courting as an example of his self-proclaimed wealth-management sophistication. That was after his nation’s independent economists had come out in one voice and general agreement that the fund was a mistake, pointing out that, as a rule, such a fund is for the well-off nations, who can afford to risk public money in alternative investments, but not for the poor ones, who look on it as an emergency resource and, as in our case, lose yet a scandalous proportion of it to official corruption. To cap his Davos offensive, Marcos launched himself into a fraudulent portrayal of his family’s rise and fall and rebound. In fact, it seems he had got so carried away by his own lies, so confident he had primed his Davos audiences, the unconfessed, if unsurprising, truth just slipped out of him. He said he had run for President “to defend ourselves,” meaning him and his family, whose persecution he constantly fictionalizes. No doubt they need protection. Not even half of the $10 billion they stole has been recovered. His mother was convicted of seven counts of graft, but has remained free on presidential intercession – Duterte’s then, now her son’s. Her son himself owes P203 billion in estate tax, which should give an idea of his scandalous worth, but refuses to pay in defiance of a court order. What is he President for, after all? Not to mention, he was just recently – if you listen to him and his cronies – the toast of Davos, and he’s back home with the news that we’ve become a favorite destination for foreign investment. If that’s not fake news, especially coming as it does from certified lying lips, I don’t know what is.  – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/film-academy-reviews-oscar-campaign-rules-surprise-nomination/,[],"LOS ANGELES, USA – Hollywood’s film academy said on Friday, January 27 it was reviewing this year’s campaigns for Oscar nominations, a day after a media report raised questions about the surprise nod for British actress Andrea Riseborough. On Tuesday, Riseborough was nominated for Best Actress for playing an alcoholic single mother in little-seen film To Leslie, a shock to awards pundits who had not expected her to be in the mix. Media newsletter Puck reported on Thursday, January 26 that the unexpected nomination had sparked questions about whether an aggressive campaign for Riseborough had violated lobbying rules set by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy issued a statement on Friday that said the organization was “conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year’s nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated.” The statement did not name Riseborough. The review also aims “to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication,” the statement said. The academy limits how studios can reach out to voters, how often and what they can say in any communications as part of their Oscars campaigns. Puck reported that the wife of the film director, actress Mary McCormack, and friends had “emailed and called tons of members of the Academy’s actors branch, begging them to see the little-watched alcoholic drama and post online about Riseborough’s searing performance.” Dozens of A-list stars then “sang her praises and helped win her the coveted nomination,” Puck said. Representatives for McCormack and Riseborough did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To Leslie has collected $27,000 at movie box offices since its release in October, according to Box Office Mojo. “We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances,” the academy statement said. Winners of the Academy Awards will be announced on March 12. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/synagogue-attack-west-bank-violence-spirals-january-2023/,[],"JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel’s military said it was boosting its forces in the occupied West Bank a day after a Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and another shooting attack in the city on Saturday, January 28, wounded two people. The attacks come towards the end of a month of growing confrontation and follow an Israeli raid in the West Bank that killed nine Palestinians, including seven gunmen, and cross-border fire between Israel and Gaza that heightened fears of a spiral in bloodshed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new cabinet, which includes hardline nationalist parties that have called for stronger action against Palestinians, was due to meet later on Saturday. Friday’s attack outside a synagogue was the deadliest in the city area since 2008. The gunman, Khairi Alqam, was a 21-year-old Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, according to police. He struck in an area that Israel annexed to Jerusalem after the 1967 war. Alkam’s father told Reuters his son had no links to any Palestinian militant groups. He struck in an area that Israel annexed to Jerusalem after the 1967 war, a move not recognised internationally. Police said he had tried to flee by car but was pursued by officers and shot dead. Forty two suspects, including members of the gunman’s family, had been arrested, the police said. On Saturday, police said a 13-year-old boy from East Jerusalem opened fire and wounded two people before he was shot and wounded by passers-by. That incident took place around Silwan, a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem that lies below the Old City walls and where Israeli settlers have stepped up their presence over the past few years. The attacks underlined the potential for an escalation in violence after months of clashes in the West Bank culminating in a raid in Jenin on Thursday that killed at least nine Palestinians, the deadliest such raid in years. “Following an IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) situational assessment, it was decided to reinforce the Judea and Samaria (West Bank) Division with an additional battalion,” the military said. On Friday night far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the attack, where he was greeted with a mixture of cheers and anger. “The government has to respond, God willing this is what will happen,” he said. Netanyahu urged people not to take the law into their own hands but said measures had been decided. Police said the gunman in the Friday attack arrived at 8:15 pm and opened fire with a handgun, hitting a number of people before he was killed by police. Shimon Israel, 56, who lives nearby, said his family were starting their Sabbath dinner when they heard shooting and screaming. He opened the window and saw his neighbour running on the street to get the police. “I told him ‘Eli, don’t go there. Eli don’t go.’ He got married only a year ago. A good neighbor, like a brother. He ran. I saw him fall there,” Israel told Reuters. “Natali, his wife, ran after him. She saw someone here and was trying to resuscitate him. The terrorist came and shot her from behind and got her too,” he said. The gunman’s father, Moussa Alkam, said he did not know what motivated his son, whom he said was an ordinary person with no militant ties. “He is neither the first nor the last young man to get martyred and what he did is a source of pride,” he said. Alkam was a relative of a 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot dead on Wednesday in clashes with Israeli forces in a Jerusalem refugee camp, his family said. But his father said he did not know whether his son acted out of revenge. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas made no mention of the shootings in a statement published by the official Palestinian agency WAFA, and blamed Israel for the escalation in violence. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, which has limited governing powers in the West Bank, suspended security cooperation arrangements with Israel after the deadly Jenin raid. Friday’s shooting, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, was condemned by the White House and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who urged “utmost restraint.” It came days before a planned visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel and the West Bank. A Ukrainian woman was among the dead, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in Kyiv. Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries that have signed peace treaties with Israel, condemned the shooting as did the United Arab Emirates, one of several Arab states that normalized relations with Israel just over two years ago. Lebanon’s Iran-backed group Hezbollah praised the attack and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas hailed it as a response to Thursday’s Jenin raid. The smaller militant group Islamic Jihad also praised the attack. Shortly after Friday’s shooting, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site, where he was greeted with a mixture of cheers and anger. “The government has to respond, God willing this is what will happen,” he said. Netanyahu, whose nationalist-religious cabinet seeks to expand settlements in the West Bank, urged people not to take the law into their own hands but said measures had been decided. Earlier on Friday, militants in Gaza fired rockets at Israel, causing no casualties but drawing Israeli air strikes in the blockaded coastal strip controlled by Hamas. The Palestinian health ministry said on Friday three Palestinians were taken to hospital after being shot by an Israeli settler in the northern West Bank. Violence in the West Bank surged after a spate of lethal attacks in Israel last year, under the previous Israeli government. At least 30 Palestinians – militants and civilians – have been killed there since the start of 2023. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/australian-colleges-crack-down-chatgpt-disabled-students-defend-artificial-intelligence/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Visually impaired student Adam Whitehead has long relied on a computer and assistive technology to help him read course materials and take exams at the University of Melbourne in Australia. He has watched with concern as universities in Australia and beyond move to crack down on ChatGPT – a free program that generates original text about virtually any subject in response to a prompt – over fears of cheating. As the chatbot stirs debate over the use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in education, disabled students and educators have said the benefits should not be overlooked in a rush to regulate. “We need to have a really careful distinction between making things accessible and getting AI to think for us,” said Whitehead, a 30-year-old philosophy major who uses technology to convert on-screen text to speech. Earlier this month, the Group of Eight (Go8) consortium of top Australian universities announced its members will set more pen-and-paper assessments in response to ChatGPT amid fears students could use it to generate essays and cheat at exams. “Assessment redesign is critical… as we seek to get ahead of AI developments,” its deputy chief executive Matthew Brown told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He said members will also use in-person supervision during assessments, and invigilation tech to monitor students taking exams online or using computers. The consortium did not respond to a request for comment over concerns that anti-AI measures could impact negatively on disabled students. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne – which is part of the Go8 – said: “Submitted assignments are monitored using increasingly advanced technology, with students’ knowledge and consent.” Some professors and students argue universities should put more focus on the potential positive uses of AI tech. “Cheating is obviously a problem,” said Anna Boucher, an associate professor at the University of Sydney who uses an AI-based voice generator to deliver lectures as she has a disability that makes speaking for long periods difficult. “But I don’t think because one aspect of AI raises some concerns that we should dismiss all aspects of AI.” ChatGPT was rolled out for free public testing on Nov. 30. It has already been banned in some public schools in New York City and Seattle, according to US media reports, while several US universities have announced plans to do fewer take-home assessments and more hand-written essays and oral exams. More than 6,000 teachers from universities including Harvard University and Yale University have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that claims to detect AI-generated text, its creator Edward Tian told the New York Times newspaper. Others take a different approach, saying universities should rethink how they teach and assess to work with new tech. For example, educators could set students practical projects such as curating a local exhibition, said Sam Illingworth, an associate professor at Edinburgh Napier University, in an article published in The Conversation. The benefits of AI for students with disabilities are undeniable, said Leslie Loble, a professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who works on tech and education. “There’s strengthening evidence that shows the best of these tools really can help disadvantaged students access learning in often more effective ways,” she said. Under Australian state and federal law, students with disabilities are entitled to “reasonable adjustments” in the classroom. But according to Australian government data, 17% of people with a disability have a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 35% without. Advocates say the divide is at least partly due to lack of accessibility and support for students with disabilities. As AI becomes ever more ubiquitous, educational technology, or edtech, has ballooned into a multi-billion-dollar industry. It is important that such technologies are “well-designed, appropriately used and strongly governed,” said Loble. “We shouldn’t assume the technology is bad. We need to move quickly and put in place strong policies and protections for educators and students,” she said. Elsewhere, there is growing pushback against some forms of AI, with performing artists demanding copyright protection for their images and voices, and a group of artists filing a class action lawsuit this month against AI software Stable Diffusion for using their works to generate images without their consent. But for students and staff with disabilities, AI technology could be revolutionary, said Betty Zhang, a biotechnology major at the University of Melbourne, who is part of a campus advocacy group for students with disabilities. “AI has tremendous potential, especially when it comes to making learning materials more accessible … it makes more sense for universities to embrace the technology,” she said, adding that returning to pen and paper “seems a bit backwards”. “If we’re able to use AI effectively, it’s not just going to benefit disabled students – making things accessible makes it way easier for everyone to learn.” – Rappler.com Originally published on Context"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/catholic-theologian-explanation-pope-francis-statement-being-gay-not-crime/,[],"Once again, Pope Francis has called on Catholics to welcome and accept LGBTQ people. “Being homosexual isn’t a crime,” the pope said in an interview with The Associated Press on January 24, 2023, adding, “let’s distinguish between a sin and a crime.” He also called for the relaxation of laws around the world that target LGBTQ people. Francis’ long history of making similar comments in support of LGBTQ people’s dignity, despite the church’s rejection of homosexuality, has provoked plenty of criticism from some Catholics. But I am a public theologian, and part of what interests me about this debate is that Francis’ inclusiveness is not actually radical. His remarks generally correspond to what the church teaches and calls on Catholics to do. During the first year of Francis’ papacy, when asked about LGBTQ people, he famously replied, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?” – setting the tone for what has become a pattern of inclusiveness. He has given public support more than once to James Martin, a Jesuit priest whose efforts to build bridges between LGBTQ people and the Catholic Church have been a lightning rod for criticism. In remarks captured for a 2020 documentary, Francis expressed support for the legal protections that civil unions can provide for LGBTQ people. And now come the newest remarks. In his recent interview, the pope said the church should oppose laws that criminalize homosexuality. “We are all children of God, and God loves us as we are and for the strength that each of us fights for our dignity,” he said, though he differentiated between “crimes” and actions that go against church teachings. The pope’s support for LGBTQ people’s civil rights does not change Catholic doctrine about marriage or sexuality. The church still teaches – and will certainly go on teaching – that any sexual relationship outside a marriage is wrong, and that marriage is between a man and a woman. It would be a mistake to conclude that Francis is suggesting any change in doctrine. Rather, the pattern of his comments has been a way to express what the Catholic Church says about human dignity in response to rapidly changing attitudes toward the LGBTQ community across the past two decades. Francis is calling on Catholics to take note that they should be concerned about justice for all people. The Catholic Church has condemned discrimination against LGBTQ people for many years, even while it describes homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered” in its catechism. Nevertheless, some bishops around the world support laws that criminalize homosexuality – which Francis acknowledged, saying they “have to have a process of conversion.” The “law of love embraces the entire human family and knows no limits,” the Vatican office concerned with social issues said in a 2005 compilation of the church’s social thought. In 2006, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops recognized that LGBTQ people “have been, and often continue to be, objects of scorn, hatred, and even violence.” And expressing care for other human persons – “especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted” by the indifference or oppression of others – represents obligations for all Catholics to embrace. As the Francis papacy now nears the end of its 10th year, it is becoming more and more common to hear Catholic leaders attempting to make LGBTQ people feel included in the church. Chicago’s Cardinal Blase Cupich has called on pastors to “redouble our efforts to be creative and resilient in finding ways to welcome and encourage all LGBTQ people.” New York’s Cardinal Timothy Dolan has welcomed LGBTQ groups in the St. Patrick’s Day parade, against the wishes of many New York Catholics. In this most recent interview, Francis emphasized that being LGBTQ is “a human condition,” calling Catholics to see other people less through the eyes of doctrine and more through the eyes of mercy. The rapid change that has happened in prevailing social attitudes about the LGBTQ community in recent decades has been difficult to process for a church that has never reacted quickly. This is especially because the questions those developments raise touch on a gray area where moral teaching intersects with social realities outside the church. For decades, church leaders have been working to reconcile the church with the modern world, and Francis is stepping in places where other Catholic bishops have already trodden. In 2018, for example, German bishops reacting to the legalization of gay marriage acknowledged that acceptance of LGBTQ relationships is a new “political reality.” There are signs that parts of the church are moving even more quickly. Catholics in Germany, in particular, have called for changes to church teaching, including permission for priests to bless same-sex couples and the ordination of married men. But those actions are outliers. Francis has criticized the German calls for reform as “elitist” and ideological. When it comes to the civil rights of LGBTQ people, the pope is not changing church teaching, but describing it. I believe the challenge the Vatican faces is to imagine the space that the church can occupy in this new reality, as it has had to do in the face of numerous social and political changes across centuries. But the imperative, as Francis suggests, is to serve justice and to seek justice for all people with mercy above all. Catholics – including bishops, and even the pope – can think, and are thinking, imaginatively about that challenge. – The Conversation | Rappler.com Portions of this article originally appeared in a previous article published on Oct. 22, 2020.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/video-memphis-police-officers-kicking-beating-tyre-nichols/,[],"TENNESSEE, USA – The city of Memphis released shocking, graphic video footage on Friday, January 27, of the violent encounter between Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, and the five police officers charged with murder in his beating death after a traffic stop earlier this month. Tyre Nichols, a Black motorist stopped by Memphis police earlier this month, is seen pummeled into submission while crying “Mom, mom,” as five police officers later charged with his murder deliver kicks, punches and baton blows in graphic video the city released on Friday. The footage from police body-worn cameras and another mounted on a utility pole were posted online a day after the five were charged with second-degree murder, assault, kidnapping, official misconduct, and oppression in the January 10 death of Nichols, age 29. Taken together, the four video clips chronicle a highly aggressive escalation of violence directed at a motorist who police had initially said they pulled over for reckless driving, though the police chief has since said that has not been substantiated. The beatings appear to continue far beyond a point where Nichols could pose any threat to police, and at one point two officers hold him upright as another punches him repeatedly in the face, as other officers on the scene stand idly by without intervening. The first video shows officers dragging Nichols from the driver’s seat of his car as he yells, “Damn, I didn’t do anything…. I am just trying to go home,” then forcing him to the ground as they order him to lie on his stomach and squirt him in the face with pepper spray. Nichols then breaks free, scrambles to his feet and sprints away down a road with officers chasing him on foot; at least one fires a stun gun at him. A separate video shows a subsequent struggle after officers catch up with Nichols again, and are beating him. Two officers are seen holding him down as a third one kicks him and a fourth delivers blows with what appears to be a rod before another punches Nichols. Nichols is heard repeatedly screaming, “Mom! Mom!” as he struggles with officers. His mother has said her son was only about 80 yards (meters) from home when he was beaten. A stretcher is seen arriving 19 minutes after the first emergency medical personnel get to the scene. The four segments of highly anticipated footage from police body-worn cameras and a camera mounted on a utility pole were posted online a day after the officers were charged with second-degree murder, assault, kidnapping, official misconduct, and oppression. The officers, all Black, had already been dismissed from the police department last Saturday following their January 7 confrontation with Nichols after pulling him over. He succumbed to his injuries and died three days later while hospitalized. Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis and lawyers for Nichols’ family who watched the video with his relatives before it was released, warned that the images were brutal and likely to cause outrage, while appealing to the public for calm. “You are going to see acts that defy humanity,” Davis told CNN in describing the footage. As the video first appeared and was being aired on CNN and other news outlets, television images showed a large group of protesters gathering in Memphis, shouting, “no justice, no peace” and carrying signs that said “The people demand: End Police Terror.” The demonstrators appeared to be blocking traffic at one point on Interstate 55. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Nichols’ family, called earlier in the day for the city police department to disband its SCORPIONS unit, a squad that is supposed to focus on violent street crime and to which at least some of the officers involved were assigned. “No mother should go through what I am going through right now, no mother, to lose their child to the violent way that I lost my child,” Tyre Nichols’ mother, RowVaughn Wells, said on Friday. US President Joe Biden said he was “outraged” and “deeply pained” after watching the Memphis video. The footage was likely to transform Nichols, the father of a 4-year-old described as an affable, accomplished skateboarder who recently enrolled in a photography class, into the next face of the US racial justice movement. Raised in Sacramento, California, Nichols moved before the coronavirus pandemic to the Memphis area, where he lived with his mother and stepfather and worked at FedEx, taking a break each day to come home for a meal prepared by his mother. Nichols’ family and President Joe Biden have appealed for protests to stay peaceful in Memphis, a city of 628,000 where nearly 65% of residents are Black. Schools were scheduled to close early and Saturday morning events were canceled. Biden spoke with RowVaughn Wells and Rodney Wells, Nichols’ stepfather, on Friday afternoon to express his condolences, the White House said, adding that it was coordinating with relevant government agencies in case protests turn violent. Nichols’ death marked the latest high-profile instance of police officers accused of using excessive force in the deaths of Black people and other minorities in recent years. These have been publicly condemned as systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. Protests under the banner of the “Black Lives Matter” movement against racial injustice erupted globally following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Antonio Romanucci, another lawyer for Nichols’ family, told National Public Radio in an interview on Friday that Nichols was a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and “basically died for his own cause.” US Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday announced a federal civil rights investigation into Nichols’ death, while law enforcement agencies in some major cities, including New York, Atlanta, and Washington, said they were preparing for possible protests following the video’s release. Police have described the circumstances of Nichols’ arrest in vague terms. Even Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who sought the officers’ indictment, was circumspect when announcing the charges. After Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving, “an altercation” ensued in which officers doused him with pepper spray, and Nichols tried to flee on foot, Mulroy said. “There was another altercation at a nearby location at which the serious injuries were experienced by Mr. Nichols.” Davis said her department has not yet been able determine whether there was probable cause for the officers to pull Nichols over for reckless driving, a traffic stop which set in motion the violent events that followed. Crump said the speed at which the criminal charges were brought against the officers – fewer than three weeks after Nichols’ death – should be a standard for police-involved killings. In some other high-profile cases, such as the police killing of Laquan McDonald in Chicago in 2014, more than a year elapsed before the release of police video and the filing of charges. Crump compared the encounter to the 1991 videotaped beating of Black motorist Rodney King by four police officers whose subsequent acquittal of criminal charges sparked days of riots in Los Angeles. Records show Justin Smith, Desmond Mills Jr., Emmitt Martin III, Demetrius Haley, and Tadarrius Bean, who were fired along with one other officer after Nichols’ death, were released on bond after they were booked into the Shelby County Jail on Thursday morning. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/zelenskiy-vows-campaign-prevent-russia-competing-paris-olympics/,[],"BERLIN, Germany – Ukraine will launch an international campaign to prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday, January 27. Sports Minister Vadim Guttsait earlier said Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes took part. They have been banned in some sports while they are allowed to compete under a neutral flag in others. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), eager to see them back in major competitions, said on Wednesday the Olympic Council of Asia had offered Russian and Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in Asia, giving them a qualification pathway for the Paris Olympics. “Today we will a start a marathon for fair play aimed at clearing the management of international Olympic structures of hypocrisy as well as [preventing] any attempts to drag representatives of the terrorist state into world sport,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. “It is obvious that any neutral flag of Russian athletes would be stained with blood… Olympic principles and war are fundamentally opposed to each other.” In a tweet following his speech, Zelenskiy called on IOC President Thomas Bach to visit the war-torn city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the stage of intense fighting. “I invite Mr. Bach to Bakhmut. So that he could see with his own eyes that neutrality does not exist,” Zelenskiy wrote. Last month Zelenskiy told Bach he opposed the idea of Russian athletes taking part under any kind of neutral banner in the 2024 Summer Games. The IOC is eager to include Russian and Belarusian athletes as neutrals at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday that any attempt to squeeze Moscow out of international sport was “doomed to fail.” Guttsait, writing on Facebook, said if Ukraine failed to ensure the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes, “I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many sports organizations have moved events and suspended Russian teams or athletes, while sponsors have ended contracts in protests against the war. “Russian strikes have claimed the lives of hundreds of Ukrainians who could have enriched world sport with their talent,” said Zelenskiy. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/automakers-electric-vehicles-surge-everything-everywhere-at-once/,[],"The surprise leadership shuffle on Thursday, January 26, at Toyota Motor Corp., renewed urgency at Renault and Nissan Motor Co. to restructure their alliance, and Elon Musk’s declaration that Tesla Inc. will be the world’s No. 1 automaker by a wide margin have one thing in common: What once defined the global auto industry’s center is no longer holding. The announcement that Akio Toyoda will step down as chief executive of the world’s top-selling automaker on April 1 came just hours after Musk used a quarterly earnings call to declare that Tesla was now the auto industry’s leader in profitability and manufacturing efficiency – the crown Toyota held for three decades. Toyota’s incoming CEO, Koji Sato, faces a daunting task. He must accelerate the Japanese automaker’s efforts to develop more competitive electric vehicles. But he will get little breathing room from Tesla or the Chinese EV manufacturers who are using their leads in EV technology and production costs to slash prices. Tesla already earns roughly seven times as much per vehicle as Toyota. Its 17% pretax margins are roughly double the average for the rest of the industry. And after a rough 2022 for the company’s shares, the stock has gained 28% to open up 2023. Musk hinted again on Wednesday that Tesla is working on a new vehicle that could sell profitably for under $30,000 – which would compete head-on with mass market models from Toyota, Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co GM. Musk has in the past teased products that took far longer to deliver than he initially promised, such as the long-delayed Cybertruck. But the Tesla chief’s ambitions are clear: To reorder the auto industry hierarchy that for decades had Toyota at the top. “I don’t think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can’t,” Musk said when asked how the auto industry could look in five years. Global automakers are experienced with periods of feast and famine that come on roughly seven-to-ten year cycles. What is happening now is different. The shocks of the pandemic, two years of supply-chain chaos and possibly a recession this year are colliding with a once-in-a-century shift of the industry’s fundamental technology. As combustion vehicles give way to electric vehicles with high-powered computer chips for brains, many of the advantages of incumbency that Toyota enjoyed are withering away. The shift to electric, computerized and software-driven vehicles has opened the door for Tesla and other startups, particularly in China, to re-set the ground rules for competition. Tesla’s price war could be just the start. “We question whether competitors can keep up in this EV race,” Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note this week. Incumbent automakers can no longer count on refinement of mature vehicle technology to stay competitive. Established automakers are investing heavily in EVs – some faster and with more success than others. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. on Thursday reported better-than-expected results powered in part by strong sales of its new EV lineup. Hyundai forecast its EV sales would grow by 54% this year – a faster growth pace than Tesla has forecast. Chinese manufacturers pouring EVs into Europe have as much as a 10,000 euro cost advantage ($10,600), Patrick Koller, chief executive of auto supplier Forvia, said earlier this month. The intensifying competition puts pressure on Renault and Nissan to resolve negotiations to restructure their alliance. The companies are now aiming to announce a deal – including an investment by Nissan in Renault’s EV unit – by February 6, sources told Reuters. Renault and Nissan once argued that their alliance gave them significant advantages in economies of scale. That potential still exists. But first they will have to fight to stay at their current size as Tesla and Chinese manufacturers try to strip away their sales. “Even though the market is shrinking, we’re growing and EVs have doubled almost year-over-year,” Tesla vice president Lars Moravy told analysts on Wednesday. “We always look at it as how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we’re just going to keep growing in that space. There’s 95% for us to go get.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/dubai-basketball-championship-results-strong-group-philippines-uae-national-team-january-27-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Strong Group Realty Philippine team denied a late rally by the UAE national team and hung on for a 91-87 squeaker to kick off the 32nd Dubai Basketball Championship on Friday, January 27 (Saturday, January 28, Manila time). Just like his heyday in the NBA, former LA Lakers and Golden State Warriors guard Nick Young provided an early scoring spark with a personal 11-2 scoring run that shifted a 19-27 first-quarter deficit to a 34-32 lead for Strong Group. The 34-year-old veteran settled for a 13-point line in 17 minutes off the bench. The performance of the night, however, belonged to Fil-Am gunner Sedrick Barefield, who erupted for 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists in just 21 minutes, while former PBA import and NBA player Shabazz Muhammad topscored with 24 for the Philippine side. Sparked by Young’s early eruption, Strong Group peaked with a 70-50 lead off a BJ Andrade corner three with 4:01 left in the third quarter, and managed to keep a 16-point lead, 90-74, with 3:11 left in regulation. Seemingly out of nowhere, however, UAE captain Omar Alshabebi pulled out a personal 13-0 barrage out of his bag that put the hosts within striking distance, 87-90, with just 14.4 ticks left on the clock. Forced into a timeout, Strong Group then got the ball to Barefield, who split his charities for the two-possession lead, 91-87, with 10.5 seconds left. Alshabebi then missed a pull-up three with 5.5 ticks left, followed by an airballed Mohamed Alhashmi downtown heave as time expired. Alshabebi led all scorers in the heartbreaking loss with a spirited 33-point performance on 14-of-28 shooting, while Julius Coles, Jr. came at a distant second with 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals in 24 minutes. Strong Group will aim for a better outing on Sunday, January 29, 1 am (Manila time) as it next faces Al Nasr Libya.

https://btf.rappler.com/161/scattered-flickers-of-light-the-education-outlook-of-the-megacity-of-metro-manila/,[],"How might we imagine a livable Manila in the next few decades? How can we build an inclusive, sustainable, and competitive megacity that embraces sustainable urbanism to support a high quality of life and holistic development? According to a 2018 report by the Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA), Manila is the most densely-populated city in the world, with over 42,000 inhabitants per square kilometer. And Metro Manila’s population alone is estimated at 21.3 million. This leads to several other issues such as the widening inequity between the rich and the poor and the contrast in their living conditions, the rise of peri-urban communities that added up to the worsening traffic crisis in the city, and the recurring human settlements issue, among many others. Education is one of the often forgotten issues in the megacity of Metro Manila. Composed of 16 cities and 1 municipality, Metro Manila is home to a string of challenges that are common to any rising city with its fair share of urban planning challenges. Large class sizes that impede the quality of learning, low salaries of teachers driving the exodus of workers to other countries, and lack of modern education facilities or even basic infrastructure such as toilets, among many others, leading up to a boiling point of challenges in what others describe as ‘bloody’, to say the least. To fully understand the complete educational panorama of Metro Manila, we need to run down the issues that plagued the sector before the pandemic. In 2019, the Department of Education (DepEd) has to cope with a staggering classroom shortage of 34,000 nationwide. In the previous years, the entire country also lacked elementary and high school teachers in what was described as ‘even larger when teacher credentials are factored in’. These are similar issues that Metro Manila was facing even before the pandemic. With the onset of COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, these problems have only worsened as Metro Manila’s educational institutions struggle with a lack of resources and strained support systems. The pandemic further highlighted these pre-existing problems as classrooms closed nationwide and schools had to transition to online learning. The sudden closure of schools also resulted in a huge number of out-of-school youth (OSY) who were unable to pursue their education due to social, economic, and geographic reasons. As a consequence, a World Bank study in 2021 revealed that about 9 of 10 children in the Philippines were suffering from ‘learning poverty’, or the inability of children by age 10 to read and understand a simple story. The Philippines is also one of the last countries in the world to resume face-to-face classes, sparking further concerns about the education crisis in the country. With Manila being the pilot implementor of any education program that gets rolled out nationwide, education leaders believe that the COVID-19 pandemic presented a whole new level of educational fiasco for the metro. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a road map for achieving a more sustainable future for all. Goal 4 on quality education ensures inclusive and equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities. But what does “quality education” mean in the context of sustainable development? How are schools achieving sustainable learning in a megacity such as Metro Manila? What is the current state of education in the country’s largest metropolis? According to AECOM’s Asia-Pacific president Sean Chiao in a 2018 interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI), solving the issues of Metro Manila requires coming up with a plan where each area is interlocked and connected with each other, like a jigsaw puzzle. Since Metro Manila is composed of 16 highly-urbanized cities and 1 municipality, each of these constituent local government units (LGUs) has different approaches to addressing their education problems. Education advocate Christian Gino Florendo, who just recently topped the recent Fisheries Professionals Licensure Examination, stressed the importance of collaboration and good governance.  He believes that progressive cities like Pasig should talk to low-income cities like Malabon. He further added that all of the cities of Metro Manila should be discussing within themselves how to improve the educational system of all cities, should know that it’s not a competition, and should adopt best practices that complement one another. He cited a scenario that a Pasigueño who studied in Pasig to complete his basic education might eventually work in Makati City, so the local government of Makati will eventually stand to benefit. This interconnectedness of the situation should be a strong case for shared approaches to policy-level interventions. He also said that avenues for the merging of ideas should be opened in order to facilitate these policy-level conversations and that organizations such as the Metro Manila Council are perfect grounds for these conversations to happen. With school buildings closed and public gatherings prohibited during the pandemic, education in the megacity has shifted to a completely different level. New learning paths were adopted by the Department of Education (DepEd) as early as October 2020. These include continuous learning initiatives and action plans, such as using special funds to help provide modules, worksheets, and study guides approved by the Department of Education (DepEd) for use by learners. Flexibility and access to digital tools are some advantages of remote learning. It also lessens physical contact, which is essential during this time of social distancing. Local government units (LGUs) in Metro Manila have worked hand-in-hand with DepEd to implement strategies that ensure quality education delivery despite the timeline of the pandemic. To strengthen support for distance and blended learning programs, LGUs provided more access to internet connectivity through free Wi-Fi installation in public areas while also giving out gadgets such as tablets or laptops for students to use at home. LGUs then partnered with private companies and organizations for additional resources such as webinars, online tutorials, and training for teachers so they could better manage virtual classrooms. A Secondary Teacher at Parang High School in the Philippines, Ms. Gemma Soneja, has taught for over twenty years and has seen first-hand how technology has revolutionized her profession. Soneja understands that it is difficult for some teachers who may not have had adequate experience with technology before the pandemic outbreak. She said, “Aside from laptops and smart TVs, internet allowance, our local LGUs and respective Schools Division Offices of DepEd conducted workshops and seminars focusing on teaching methods suitable for remote learning.” While these interventions are greatly appreciated by teachers like Gemma Soneja, she believes that more can still be done. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, the state of education in Metro Manila remains unclear. With 89% of the student population, or 1.52 billion children and youth, out of school due to closures, among them are close to 4 million students from the Philippines alone (DepEd). This unprecedented situation has left Metro Manila pushing for sustainable learning amidst this global health crisis. In response, government authorities had to implement rapid changes in learning approaches, such as shifting from face-to-face instruction to remote learning through online platforms and alternative educational media tools provided by DepEd.In order for students and schools to adapt swiftly, special funds were made available for them to create modules, worksheets, and study guides that have been approved by the Department of Education (DepEd). Despite the numerous challenges they faced while transitioning into a new normal, many local communities have risen to support each other through various initiatives driven by civic organizations and private sector partners. For example, free internet access is provided by some private organizations like Smart Communications Inc., Globe Telecom, and PLDT, while some DepEd-approved educational apps are being used as supplementary tools for teaching and learning, such as Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams. Achieving sustainable learning in a megacity is no easy feat; however, this can be made possible with the right resources and support from both the public and private sectors. Access to quality education is a distant dream for students living in Metro Manila’s urban poor communities. The challenge of gaining entry into healthy learning institutions (HLIs) in Metro Manila has become an increasingly difficult task for many impoverished families. From outdated teaching modules and an insufficient teacher-student ratio to unfulfilled K-12 implementations, the reality of providing quality education in these areas often falls painfully short of expectations. The president of Youth for Mental Health PH, Alyannah Lagasca, has spoken out about these issues and believes that providing quality education in urban poor communities should be prioritized by policymakers. She believes that social protection through free education, like Canada’s model, should be given precedence, with politicians visiting “laylayan” (urban poor” areas and communities and LGUs having local scholarship funds that nurture both academic and life skills. Such initiatives include allocating more funds towards improving the curriculum by updating modules and providing additional resources such as computers, reducing overcrowding in classrooms, and properly implementing K–12 to ensure that the children receive an adequate education regardless of their socio-economic status. The pandemic might have made the whole world stop, but that did not stop Metro Manila from working toward a better future of learning and education. Hopeful stories emerged amidst struggles to keep schools afloat in an ever-changing environment. The government’s efforts to maintain quality tertiary education while addressing poverty issues were an inspiring feat for many Filipinos, particularly those living in urban poor communities. For instance, the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (UAQTEA) institutionalized free tuition. It exempted other fees at state universities and colleges (SUCs) as well as local universities and colleges (LUCs). This program is part of a larger initiative towards creating healthy learning institutions (HLIs), which seek to provide an ideal student–teacher ratio through policies like teacher capacity-building initiatives and financial aid programs for students. Despite economic hardships, many local governments in Metro Manila are pushing for education reform and sustainable development in their communities. One of the initiatives is providing scholarship programs for urban low-income families so that their children may have access to quality education. For example, the Pasig City government allotted  5 million pesos worth of scholarships in 2022. At the same time, HLIs also strive to build relationships between private institutions and public school districts. This kind of collaboration goes beyond just having classes: it involves resource sharing between stakeholders, such as free textbooks, e-learning courses, and even shared facilities like libraries or computer laboratories. This way, not only can everyone benefit from the advantages of technology, but they can also acquire relevant knowledge for their respective fields of study. The success stories don’t end here: LGUs have partnered with local businesses and organizations to provide more employment opportunities for out-of-school youth (OSYs). Through this initiative, OSYs can receive free job training and mentorship programs that will help them build their skill set and gain meaningful employment once they finish their studies. All these efforts are just a few examples of how Metropolitan Manila strives to become an ideal location for sustainable development through quality education opportunities and initiatives prioritizing access over privilege. Though much more work is needed for these goals to be fully realized, it’s reassuring that despite facing unprecedented times, hope remains alive through innovative solutions such as those implemented by our local government units. The dream of a livable Metro Manila is here to stay. As we slowly transition out of the pandemic, the megacity of Metro Manila is back on its feet in opening its urban learning environments. Students have seen redesigned classrooms, urban poor communities are slowly receiving free training in training centers and other areas where education drives are possible, and policymakers are slowly rolling out consortiums and strategic planning for more targeted education policies and programs that support equitable education in the megacity. Leading-edge thinkers have also crafted plans for investing more resources into improving existing remote learning solutions as well as introducing new technologies and platforms that are accessible and affordable for all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic background or ability level. Additionally, more inclusive programs for marginalized populations, such as those with disabilities, are also being explored to ensure that everyone has equal access to quality education. Joie Cruz, an education champion in the country who has helped educate 10,000 beneficiaries of a digital literacy program, believes that for Metro Manila to keep up with the educational challenges brought about by the metropolis’ rising population, digitization should be at the core of the education department’s mandate, modern learning centers must be dispersed, the curriculum must be updated to improve competitiveness in the job, transportation infrastructures must be improved to facilitate ease of access to schools, and most importantly, teachers must have a good quality of life, are paid enough, and are not bombarded with clerical work. Joie also highlighted that a megacity doesn’t stand by itself and that its issues are interconnected to the issues that other parts of the country are facing. Hence, she believes that while the government is addressing issues on outdated curriculum, job mismatch, and underemployment in the metropolis, it also needs to decentralize and develop more digital cities, invest more in other future cities, and ‘de-imperialize’ outside Metro Manila to redistribute opportunities. According to her, looking at the problem on a macro-level that way can help improve the quality of education in Metro Manila in the future. For Alyannah Lagasca, who herself champions education for the youth in the megacity, sustainable development requires a holistic approach that considers both social and economic elements. She believes that a sustainable education system in Metro Manila can help address other issues such as income inequality and promote a culture of inclusion, acceptance, and collaboration between different sectors within the city, eventually leading to economic growth while also improving the overall quality of life. And that’s her hope for Metro Manila, an inclusive, sustainable, and competitive megacity striving towards greater sustainability and equality in its educational systems. As how Alyannah puts it, the dream is not over. Notwithstanding the several challenges, as a whole, the state of education in the megacity is slowly moving forward. One step at a time, but always onward."
https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/cash-strapped-finland-zoo-return-giant-pandas-china/,[],"HELSINKI, Finland – A cash-strapped Finnish zoo said on Friday, January 27, it was preparing to return two giant pandas on loan from China as it could no longer afford their upkeep. The pandas, named Lumi and Pyry, were brought to Finland in January 2018, nine months after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Nordic country and signed a joint agreement on protecting the animals. Ahtari Zoo, a private company which had hoped the pandas would bring visitors to the central Finland location, said it had instead accumulated mounting debts as the pandemic curbed travel. Finland’s government, which gave one-off support of 200,000 euros in 2021, declined an application for a 5 million euro ($5.4 million) grant. The decision came after some members of parliament pointed out that the amount was higher than what the country spends annually on protecting some of its own endangered species. The foreign ministry said it had established a working group to seek a solution, but added there was no certainty one would be found. “If the pandas were returned, we believe that China would understand it would be a business decision of a private company in a difficult financial situation,” a ministry spokesperson said. “We do not believe that this would have wider effects on the relations between Finland and China.” A final decision on whether to return the pandas will be made on Feb. 28, the zoo said. Giant pandas, whose black and white faces have made them beloved around the world, are considered a vulnerable species, with much of their mountainous natural habitat in southwest China under threat from deforestation. China’s modern panda diplomacy dates back to at least 1972 when it donated two giant pandas to the United States. – Rappler.com"

The American import got to show why the Elasto Painters brought him in as he finished with 35 points, 17 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 blocks, and 2 steals to redeem himself from his underwhelming Rain or Shine debut against Meralco. In the 105-87 defeat to the Bolts, Qualls recorded 14 points after making just 3 of his 22 field goals for a horrific 14% clip. “That is part of the good sign that we can take away from this game today,” Elasto Painters head coach Yeng Guiao said of Qualls’ upgraded performance. “I had a talk with him, he really got frustrated in the first game. He also got frustrated in this game. Actually he was missing free throws, he was taking bad shots towards the end, but it is still a lot better than the Meralco game.” Although Qualls can still work on his efficiency after going 10-of-26 (39%) from the field and 12-of-19 (63%) from the free throw line, he sank crucial buckets that allowed Rain or Shine to stay in the game. Qualls scored a triple and a floater in succession to pull the Elasto Painters within 100-102 before Mikey Williams sealed the win for the Tropang Giga with his own clutch three-pointer. “I think just like the whole team, I’ll take this kind of game anytime from these guys. We can only get better,” said Guiao. Despite going down 0-2, Guiao feels the way his wards fought against TNT is a step in the right direction as the team continues its hunt for its first win. “It is still a sign of improvement,” said Guiao. “I guess once we break the ice, we’ll play better.” Rain or Shine faces another tough test as it battles unbeaten Converge next on February 2 at the PhilSports Arena. – Rappler.com"

TNT head coach Jojo Lastimosa said Williams will eventually reclaim his starting spot, especially after his all-around outing fueled a 105-100 comeback win over Rain or Shine in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Friday, January 27. Williams finished with 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists, capping his impressive performance with a clutch three-pointer with 30 seconds left that sealed the victory for the Tropang Giga. “Mikey is eventually going to go back to the starting lineup,” said Lastimosa. “He already started the second half. It is going to be like that. That is his spot.” “Now that we can see that he is already close to his normal self, you can see more of him of course.” The reigning PBA scoring champion started 59 out of the 65 games he played for TNT going into the Governors’ Cup. So it came as a surprise when Williams came off the bench in their conference-opening 123-119 win over Phoenix, where he produced just 9 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals in over 27 minutes of play. Just a few months ago, Lastimosa, who concurrently serves as the Tropang Giga team manager, cracked the whip on Williams by suspending the Filipino-American guard last conference when he repeatedly skipped practices. During that mess, Lastimosa said the First Mythical Team member was “acting like he is on another level.” But Lastimosa clarified the team simply did not want to rush Williams as he continues to recover from a leg injury he sustained earlier this season. Lastimosa even gave Williams a pat on the back before the post-game presser. “There is a reason why he was coming off the bench at the beginning – because he was not in shape yet. Not yet. He was trying to get back in shape. He had a really difficult time rehabbing his two Achilles heels,” Lastimosa said. Williams, for his part, said he is slowly but surely regaining his top form. “I’m just trying to gradually get it back right each and every day, just trying to do everything I can to make sure it is strengthened.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-army-set-to-cement-rule-with-tough-new-election-criteria/,[],"Myanmar’s ruling junta on Friday, January 27, announced tough requirements for parties to contest an election this year, including a huge increase in their membership, a move that could sideline the military’s opponents and cement its grip on politics. Myanmar’s top generals led a coup in February 2021 after five years of tense power-sharing under a quasi-civilian political system that was created by the military, which led to a decade of unprecedented reform. The country has been in chaos since the putsch, with a resistance movement fighting the military on multiple fronts after a bloody crackdown on opponents that saw Western sanctions re-imposed. The military has pledged to hold an election in August this year. An announcement in Friday’s state media said parties intending to compete nationally must have at least 100,000 members, up from 1,000 previously, and commit to running in the election in the next 60 days or be de-registered as a party. The rules favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a military proxy stacked with former generals, which was trounced by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party in 2015 and 2020 elections. The NLD was decimated by the coup, with thousands of its members arrested or jailed, including Suu Kyi, and many more in hiding. Richard Horsey, senior adviser to the International Crisis Group, who was based in Myanmar for 15 years, said the rules aimed to restore a political system the military can control. “Parties are going to be either too scared, offended at the sham that the election is, or it will just be too expensive for them to mount a nationwide campaign in that kind of environment. Who would fund a political party right now?” he said. “This whole exercise is something to perpetuate military rule. It’s a piece of theater. It doesn’t have to work, because they’ve decided what the outcome will be.” The junta says it is committed to democracy and seized power because of unaddressed violations in a 2020 election won in a landslide by the ruling NLD. The NLD in November described the election as “phoney” and said it would not acknowledge it. The election has also been dismissed as a sham by Western governments. – Rappler.com"

Williams finished with 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists, hitting a gutsy triple inside the final 30 seconds that allowed the Tropang Giga to complete their fightback from an 18-point hole and stay unbeaten in two games. Elasto Painters import Michael Qualls scored 5 straight points to singlehandedly trim a seven-point deficit to 100-102 with 50 seconds left before Williams put the nail in the coffin with a casual trey. “Mikey bailed us out with that shot,” said TNT head coach Jojo Lastimosa. Jalen Hudson also finished with 24 points to go with 14 rebounds, while Roger Pogoy fired 22 points as they teamed up with M. Williams in their 44-point explosion in the third quarter that turned things around for the Tropang Giga. Rain or Shine opened its biggest lead of the game with a 47-29 cushion in the second quarter but TNT clawed its way back and got within 80-84 going into the final salvo. Pogoy (14), Hudson (13), and M. Williams (8) combined for 35 points in the third quarter to match what the Elasto Painters produced in the period. The Tropang Giga then finally seized the upper hand off a Kelly Williams bucket with six minutes remaining, 93-92, before Hudson, Pogoy, and M. Williams provided the finishing touches. K. Williams added 13 points and 8 rebounds, while Justin Chua and Jayson Castro contributed 8 and 7 points, respectively, in the win. Qualls redeemed himself from his dismal shooting display in an 18-point loss to Meralco five days prior with 35 points, 17 rebounds, 5 rebounds, 2 blocks, and 2 steals. But not even his upgraded performance could prevent the Elasto Painters from suffering their second straight defeat to start the conference.

https://www.rappler.com/business/ltfrb-report-commuters-using-illegal-russian-ride-hailing-apps-transportation-crisis/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – With high transportation fares and a lack of services, some commuters are resorting to illegal and potentially dangerous ride-hailing apps, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Friday, January 27. The LTFRB has identified two popular Russian-based ride-hailing apps – InDrive and Maxim – offering transport network vehicle service (TNVS) operations without any accreditation. That means these operators are not vetted when it comes to financial capacity, customer service, and driver accreditation and training. “It undermines ‘yung security ng mga riding public natin. Hindi mo identified ‘yung tao, and then pag may nangyari sa’yo, there is no insurance na sasagot,” said LTFRB Chairman Teofilo Guadiz III in a press conference on Friday. (It undermines the security of our riding public. You can’t identify the person, and then if something happens to you, there’s no insurance to cover you.) For context, companies with TNVS operations must obtain permits from the LTFRB that certify them as transport network companies (TNC). “If you are the TNVS company, gusto mo mag-conduct ng business dito, you have to go through the legitimate government process. Magparehistro ka muna, have yourself accredited, have yourself registered with the different government agencies,” the chairman said. “Hindi naman po namin sinasaway si InDrive at Maxim to enter into a legitimate business in the Philippines.” (If you are the TNVS company and you want to conduct business here, you have to go through the legitimate government process. Register first, have yourself accredited, and have yourself registered with the different government agencies. We aren’t dissuading InDrive and Maxim from entering into a legitimate business in the Philippines.) Both InDrive and Maxim are Russian-owned companies. Although they have legitimate operations in other countries, the same isn’t true when it comes to the Philippines. They have no local offices, and no licenses or accreditation with government agencies. Currently, the apps offer four-wheel and two-wheel ride-hailing services, along with food delivery services, depending on the area. Since they have no physical presence in the country, the LTFRB said that both companies recruit drivers through Facebook community posts. As of January 27, both apps are still available for download in the Philippines through the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, although the LTFRB is coordinating with the Department of Information and Communications Technology to restrict access to the apps. Here’s a quick rundown of each of the illegal ride-hailing services. The LTFRB warned that using these apps – or any unaccredited transport service – may expose passengers to “poor service quality, reliability, and safety.” “Pag may nangyari sa inyo po sa daan – just like what happened in Metro Manila – hindi namin mahabol ‘yung kompanya (If something happens to you on the road – just like what happened in Metro Manila – we can’t go after the company) because there is no company to talk with in the first place,” he said. Guadiz was referring to social media posts about a private motor vehicle posing as a TNVS provider and operating around a mall in Quezon City. “The LTFRB received reports coming from social media networks about a vehicle allegedly offering TNVS services among commuters but in a forcible manner and charged a much higher fare,” the LTFRB said in a statement on Wednesday, January 25. Despite lacking any government accreditation, Guadiz noted that commuters continue to avail of their services. He cited two possible: lower fare prices and a lack of ride-hailing services, particularly in the provinces. Because passengers can negotiate the price with the driver, fares can come out cheaper than those of licensed TNVS providers. “It’s cheaper. Unlike in other companies, may mga fixed price. Dito po, pag sagot ng driver, may negotiations kaagad. Magkano ang binibigay mo (there is a fixed price. Here, when the driver replies, you start negotiating. You give an offer), the driver makes a counteroffer, and then takes you for a ride,” the LTFRB chairman said. Guadiz explained that the fares are lower in part because these companies are unregulated and most likely do not pay any local taxes. “They don’t pay government fees. Mababa po ang singil nito (They charge less). But then again, these are illegitimate. Kapag may nangyari sa’yo, there’s no way for the LTFRB or for other government agencies na habulin ‘yung tao (If something happens to you, there’s no way for the LTFRB or for other government agencies to go after these people).” However, the fact that commuters resort to illegitimate TNVS operators may also point to inadequate service providers, especially in the provinces. “The very reason why these companies come up is because of probably lack of TNVC servicing units sa mga probinsya (in the provinces),” Guadiz admitted. “But ang solusyon po niyan (the solution is) is not for these companies to operate illegally, but to come in legally, register with us, and we will give them their proper franchise to operate in the province – hindi po ‘yung patago na ginagawa nila (not sneaking around like what they’re doing).” Nevertheless, Guadiz maintained that the country has an “adequate number of TNVCs,” despite the proliferation of these unaccredited services. He warned that owners and riders may face stiff penalties as the LTFRB begins to crack down on the illegal operations. Four-wheeled vehicle owners violating colorum rules may be fined up to P200,000, while two-wheeled vehicles may be fined P50,000. Drivers may have their license revoked and may also face jail time. “Pakiusap na lang po, sa mga kababyan natin who are using these apps, ‘yung mga drivers (I’m asking those who use these apps, and the drivers), you better cease and desist. One of these days, ang sasakay po sa inyo will be an LTFRB agent or an HPG agent, and just like in Cebu, hinuli po ang driver. Inimpound po ang sasakyan (you’ll pick up an LTFRB agent or an HPG agent, and just like in Cebu, the driver will be caught. Your vehicle will be impounded),” the LTFRB chief warned. – Rappler.com"

The Bossing are set to welcome back Troy Rosario from his injury after ending a seven-game skid by way of a 108-105 victory over Phoenix in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Friday, January 27. Blackwater head coach Ariel Vanguardia said Rosario will make his conference debut either against San Miguel on February 1 or against Meralco on February 4. “It is a huge, huge upgrade – a huge addition if he can play, if we get at least an 80 percent Troy Rosario,” said Vanguardia in a mix of Filipino and English. Rosario played just five games for the Bossing last conference and averaged 12.6 points, 5 rebounds, and 1.8 assists. The former Gilas Pilipinas mainstay suffered a foot injury and has now missed eight straight games, including their 124-102 loss to NLEX that opened their Governors’ Cup campaign last January 22. Coincidentally, the last time Rosario suited up for Blackwater was also the last time it won a game – a 93-86 victory over Terrafirma in October – before the Bossing arrested their losing streak by beating the Fuel Masters. “Troy is like a Swiss Army knife. He can play the three, four, and five positions. We all know the veteran leadership and poise that he can give the team,” said Vanguardia. While the return of Rosario will prompt Vanguardia to tweak his rotation, which now includes newcomers Tyrus Hill and RK Ilagan and returnee Mike DiGregorio, he called it a “pleasant problem.” Vanguardia added Rosario will help reduce the burden on import Shawn Glover, who is averaging 28.5 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 blocks, and 1.5 steals. “It is better to have a lot of players that you can use instead of the opposite,” said Vanguardia. – Rappler.com"

Coming mostly from the poorest communities across the Philippines, they pine for justice and accountability, some still pinning hopes on the International Criminal Court to investigate the killings. In this series, Rappler revisits some of those who were left behind – to listen and retell their stories – as they seek justice in the face of continuing fear and challenges post-Duterte. Second of 4 parts
PART 1 | Drug war widow: Why is Duterte still free when our loved ones are dead? MANILA, Philippines – If the narrow and densely populated alleys in Metro Manila could talk, they would say Niño* was more than just one of the lifeless bodies dumped on the streets in Rodrigo Duterte’s Philippines. He sometimes drank to the point of inebriation, but a sober Niño was often seen mingling with people and spreading the word of the Lord to anyone who listened, freshly picked from the Bible that he loved to read. Mila described her brother as a good person, generous with compliments and advice for family and friends. He was a caring and thoughtful person who wanted the best for everyone. The last time Mila saw him, Niño reminded her to take good care of her children. But these did not matter to merciless killers who thrived during the Duterte administration. In the end, it was Niño’s only vice – drinking – that triggered a nightmare that the family would try their best to escape from for the rest of their lives. A drunk Niño was accosted and brought to the barangay (village) hall one day in March 2017. A younger brother followed not half an hour later to bring him home and resume what should have been another ordinary day, only to be told that Niño had already been released. “Wala naman siya sa bahay kaya bumalik siya kasama nanay namin pero sabi uuwi rin iyong kapatid namin, pero iyong mga pulis nang-insulto pa, sabi baka nasa bulsa nila,” Mila recalled. “Walang magawa ang nanay ko at kapatid ko kaya umuwi na lang sila at patuloy na naghanap kung saan-saan, pero hindi talaga nila nakita,” Mila recalled. (No one was at home so my brother and our mother went back to the station only to be waved off, saying our brother would eventually find his way home. But the police also insulted them, that maybe he was in their pocket. My brother and mother couldn’t do anything so they just continued looking everywhere to no avail.) It was nine in the morning when Mila received a call that Niño was already found. By then, it had been three days since he was accosted. Knowing that his brother did not use illegal drugs, she asked: How is he? What time did he arrive home? But the reality was far from what Mila expected. Niño’s lifeless body was discovered near a creek not far from the family home. His head was covered with a black trash bag and secured with packaging tape. Police allegedly found illegal drugs in his pocket. It was a familiar and recurring scene in Duterte’s drug war. Thousands of Filipinos, mostly from the poorest communities, ended up dead with their bodies wrapped in plastic, dumped on streets that turn quiet at night. In many cases, there would be a cardboard sign tagging victims as either drug users or drug peddlers – a warning sign for what’s to come for those who dared. The body the family saw in the funeral parlor worsened their suffering. Niño reportedly had black eyes and visibly bruised arms and legs. There was also a questionable mark on his neck. A death certificate Rappler reviewed stated that he had gunshot wounds in the head. “Nanginig iyong laman ko noong nakita ko siya, parang pinagbagsakan ako ng langit at lupa kasi kitang-kita na pinahirapan nila iyong kapatid ko, napakasakit talaga,” she told Rappler. “Hindi ko naman inisip na magiging ganoon kasi lasing lang naman siya at wala naman ginagawa sa kanila iyong tao pero bakit nila pinatay?” Mila said. (My whole body trembled when I saw my dead brother’s body. Like the world collapsed on me because I saw that they tortured him. It was really painful. I never expected that it would happen to him because he was just drunk and didn’t do anything bad. Why did they have to kill him?) Mila, then nine months pregnant, wanted to cry and yell. She desperately wanted answers about why his 31-year-old brother’s life was cut short. But as the second eldest, Mila knew she had to stay strong for her mother and the remaining siblings. Niño’s death was only the beginning of heartbreak and pain. Two more brothers would be killed after him – one in 2019 under Duterte and another in September 2022, less than three months into the Marcos administration. Three family members were brutally killed in a span of five years. Eight siblings were brought down to five. Danilo had big dreams for everyone around him, but most especially for the child he had as a teenager. At 21, he was determined to go back to school to finish his studies, hoping it would lead to a better life than what he’d known so far. It was the same reason he cited as he begged for his life in front of alleged police one night in June 2019. “Sir, huwag po, wala po akong alam diyan, gusto ko lang po mag-aral (Sir, please don’t, I don’t have anything to do with that, I only want to study),” witnesses recalled hearing from the dark alley where Danilo was dragged to, according to Mila. He cried for his mother, he cried for everyone dear to him, but the words fell on deaf ears. The neighbors told Mila the police punched her brother, placed a gun to his head, and shot him dead. It was an anti-drug police operation that reportedly targeted the house of Danilo’s friend, just one of the many operations in the area that night. Mila was awakened by a phone call at five in the morning with the news that her second to the youngest brother was dead. Her brother, the one who sought refuge at her house to ask advice about life, the one whom neighbors loved for always being available to lend a hand in the community, was accused of fighting back. When their eldest sibling Niño was killed in 2017, Mila begged her other brothers to stay out of trouble and not leave the house at night. But these reminders were useless. “Nataranta ako noon, hindi ko alam gagawin ko kaya natulala na lang ako kasi bakit iyong kapatid ko pa na mabait, bakit siya pinatay?” Mila said. (My head was a mess, I didn’t know what to do, because why would they kill my kind brother?) Careful not to wake up her children, Mila rushed to the scene of the crime where she met the rest of the shell-shocked family. They were still reeling from a tragic loss just two years prior, and now Duterte’s drug war claimed another one of their own flesh and blood. The atmosphere was tense a few feet from where Danilo and three others were killed. There was an exchange of words on what to do next. Mila’s family wanted to see Danilo immediately, but the authorities told them to just retrieve the body from the funeral parlor. “Hindi ko makakalimutan kung gaano kasama ang titig [ng mga pulis] sa aming magkapamilya,” Mila recalled. (I will never forget how the police looked at me and my family.) By some chance, according to Mila, a sibling was able to pull the blanket covering Danilo. What they saw took them back to the moment they saw their eldest brother Niño in the funeral parlor in 2017. According to Mila, Danilo’s body and face were also black and bruised. A death certificate that Rappler reviewed stated that he also suffered from gunshot wounds to the head and trunk. “Sabi pa naman ng nanay namin noong 2017, mag-ingat kami at huwag na lumaban noong namatay ang kuya namin kasi baka kung ano pa mangyari sa iba naming mga kapatid, pero nangyari pa rin kaya napakasakit,” she said. (My mother told us in 2017 that we should be careful and not challenge the police over what happened to our oldest brother because they might go after us. But it still happened, another brother was killed so it’s really painful.) The absence of Danilo and Niño was felt in the family home in the years following their deaths. There were two less people during celebrations, outings, or the normal meals the family shared in the past years. There was confusion, there was anger, but most of all there was sadness. Two brothers killed in cold blood just two years apart, leaving a family wondering what they did to deserve such tragedy. The siblings knew they couldn’t let their mother stay at home, so they encouraged her to continue working in a nearby factory. The silence in the house was all too much for the family matriarch. “Isang buwan na tulala ang nanay namin at hindi namin siya nakausap kasi laging umiiyak,” Mila said. “Pinapalakas namin ang loob niya at sinasabihan na ‘andito pa kami, lumaban siya para sa amin.” (For a month, my mother kept on staring in space and refused to talk to us, she was always crying. We told her to stay strong, if only for us.) Duterte stepped down from the presidency on June 30, 2022 leaving a trail of blood across the country. In May, a month before Duterte left office, government data showed that at least 6,252 individuals were killed by the police. This number does not include those killed vigilante-style which human rights groups estimate to be between 27,000 to 30,000. There was initial confusion as to what the anti-illegal drug campaign under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. would look like. But in September, Marcos said it will focus on prevention and rehabilitation as enforcement “only gets you so far.” But Duterte’s culture of impunity and violence is so far-reaching that the impact would be felt for generations to come. Mila’s family saw it first-hand. Joel, the third of eight siblings, spent most of the past years in and out of detention facilities for various reasons, including illegal drugs. He had a harder life compared to the rest of the family, Mila admitted, as their mother paid little attention to him growing up. Joel was let out of prison for the last time in May 2022 and was looking forward to spending Christmas again with the entire family after years of being apart. But six unidentified men had other plans for him. In September 2022, Joel was shot dead while he was out to buy something from the neighborhood convenience store. The perpetrators used a gun silencer, according to witnesses, and really made sure their target was killed. Mila considers Joel her closest sibling. They were born only a few years apart and went through the most important periods of their lives together. She didn’t expect she would never share anything with him anymore. “Akala ko hindi na ako iiyak, kasi baka bato na ako pero nung nakita ko ang katawan niya, nawasak na naman ang mundo ko (I thought I was not going to cry anymore because I’m numb, but when I saw his dead body, my world collapsed again),” Mila said. In less than six years, Mila lost three brothers to the senseless violence that dominated the country since Duterte came into power in 2016. Their mother grieves for three sons. A child will grow up without a father. Mila looked at her remaining siblings and told them to be careful. But she knew it was out of their hands, such as in the cases of their three slain siblings. “Nagtatrabaho sila, lumalayo sa barkada, pero puwedeng bigla na lang silang pinatay kahit na walang may karapatan na gumawa ng ganoon,” she said. “Sabi ko sa kapatid ko sa burol niya, binulong ko sa kanya sa kabaong niya, ikaw na ang huli, isama mo na iyong lahat ng gulo sa iyo, tama na kasi hindi ko na kaya,” Mila recalled. (My brothers all had jobs, stayed away from bad influences, but they were still killed even if no one had the right to do that. I told my brother Joel during his wake, I whispered to his lifeless body, to make sure he would be the last one, that he should bring with him to the afterlife all the trouble we have had to live through, because I cannot take it happening again.) Mila’s family wanted to get justice, to question the police’s narratives about what happened to their three brothers. They took inspiration from other families of drug war victims who organized themselves into groups, who filed communications before the International Criminal Court (ICC). But the initial steps they took were dismissed, if not met with hostility from authorities. There were many times Mila had to step back and let her other sibling talk to the police, fearing that she’d get carried away. Sometimes she’s tempted to fight, but she knows the deadly cost of speaking out. The alleged perpetrators, after all, were still assigned to the nearby communities. Her family doesn’t trust the police nor the government anymore. “Iniisip ko na lang na wala naman akong ginagawang masama pero kung iyong iba nga, hindi naman gumawa ng hindi maganda pero pinatay pa rin nila,” she said. “Kung gusto ka nilang patayin, papatayin ka nila talaga,” Mila continued. (I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong so I should not be afraid. But you see several cases where they still killed people who didn’t do anything wrong. If they want to kill you, they will.) If it was up to Mila, she’d want Duterte to be held responsible for the slaughter of thousands of Filipinos. But as it stands, the former president continues to evade any semblance of accountability six months into the Marcos administration that promised “real justice in real time.” “Galit na galit ako, masakit, naiinis kasi parang mga hayop na pinagpapatay dito tapos siya ang saya-saya niya sa lugar niya na parang balewala lang,” Mila added. “Iyong kasalukuyang presidente natin ngayon, wala rin siyang ginagawa, kinakalimutan na nila iyong mga pamilyang naghahanap ng hustisya, dahil lang ba mahihirap kami?” she asked. (I am so incensed, so hurt, and annoyed that people were killed like animals and yet Duterte is still so happy in his hometown as if nothing happened. The current president is doing nothing and just ignoring the families who are still looking for justice. Is it because we are poor?) Mila is looking forward to proceedings at the ICC, the last resort many families cling to in the hopes of getting any semblance of justice for their slain loved ones. She said she’s willing to engage if needed. On Friday morning Manila time, the ICC announced that the pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the investigation into the drug war killings under Duterte. Mila will continue calling out the double-faced approach of the Marcos administration to the human rights issue – even if just in front of her television screen. “Kapag nanonood ako ng balita, para akong may kaaway, sabi ko, hoy ‘wag ‘nyo kaming lokohin,” she said. “Sabi ng asawa ko para akong baliw kasi hindi naman daw ako ang kausap, pero at least alam ko na mali sila.” (When I watch news on television, it’s like I’m fighting someone, because I say out loud that they can’t fool us. My husband thinks I’m crazy, but at least I know those in power are wrong.) – Rappler.com *Names have been changed for their protection PART 3 | After losing mother to Duterte’s drug war, 17-year-old asks: Will justice ever come?"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/comelec-rejects-pimentel-pacquiao-appeal-cusi-wing-heads-pdp-laban/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Nearly 10 months after the conclusion of the 2022 presidential polls, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) denied an appeal from Senator Aquilino Pimentel and then presidential candidate Manny Pacquiao for the body to reconsider its decision on who truly leads the once-ruling PDP-Laban. The commission en banc announced on Friday, January 27, that it denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Pimentel and Pacquiao over the leadership squabble in the party. On May 6, or three days before Election Day in 2022, the Comelec’s Special Second Division voted 2-1 in favor of the PDP-Laban faction headed by former Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi with Melvin Matibag as secretary-general. The Cusi wing is the one that then-President Rodrigo Duterte chaired. The Comelec ruling meant that the Cusi-led wing represented the PDP-Laban leadership and not the one headed by Pimentel and Pacquiao. Pimentel is the son of PDP-Laban co-founder Aquilino “Nene” Pimentel Jr. The commission en banc decided it was correct in recognizing the Cusi and Matibag faction’s case and referring it to the Special Second Division. The said division then recognized meetings and elections held by the Cusi-led wing. Yet even as the Cusi-wing won the challenge before Comelec, it was the majority-party only in name, at least in the national race. PDP-Laban, despite having the incumbent president then as one of its leaders, was without a standard-bearer for the 2022 presidential polls. Instead, it adopted as its vice presidential candidate Duterte’s daughter Sara Duterte and later, her coalition partner Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as presidential candidate. Sara Duterte was a Lakas-CMD candidate while Marcos ran under the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas. Marcos and Duterte both secured big wins in the 2022 elections. Pacquiao also ran as president but under the obscure PROMDI party because of the mess over PDP-Laban’s leadership. But what the May 6 Comelec decision meant that since it was still the dominant political party, PDP-Laban had priority access to election returns and polling places – a crucial advantage for candidates in local races. In a statement released by Matibag, PDP-Laban said it was “elated” by the Comelec ruling. “The ‘D’ in PDP-Laban stands for ‘DEMOKRATIKO’ – it is the core principle in which the party was built. The PDP- Laban is about representative democracy,” said Matibag, saying it was its members who were incumbent elected officials who chose in July 2021, Duterte and Cusi as leaders of the party. Pimentel said they will elevate the case to the Supreme Court. “We will appeal to the Supreme Court. The Comelec should refrain from using the phrase ‘vox populi, vox Dei’ in their press statements because that is just the statement of the Comelec not the voice of the people. Our Comelec people might slowly get some kind of messianic complex if they start believing that what they say is the voice of God,” he said in a statement on Friday. PDP-Laban was founded by the elder Pimentel in the 1980s as a challenge to the incumbent President’s father and namesake, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. It was part of the ruling political coalition under the presidency of the late Cory Aquino, who took over after the ouster of the tyrant Marcos. In an ironic twist, PDP-Laban leader and then president Duterte would grant a hero’s burial for the deposed dictator. – Rappler.com"

Nine-time champion Djokovic will meet third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday’s decider after the Greek booked his first final at Melbourne Park by beating Russian Karen Khachanov in the earlier semifinal. Serbian Djokovic’s father Srdjan created a distraction for his son ahead of the semifinal after a video emerged showing him posing with fans holding Russian flags, which were banned at Melbourne Park early in the tournament. With Srdjan declining to attend the semifinal for fear of creating further disruption for his son, fourth seed Djokovic was in a foul mood early at Rod Laver Arena and surrendered a 5-1 lead in the first set as unseeded Paul rallied to 5-5. Djokovic then knuckled down. In a furious counter-attack, he won 14 of the next 17 games to seal another one-sided victory in his bid for a 22nd Grand Slam title to match Rafa Nadal. “I’m really thankful that I still have enough gas in my legs to play at this level on one of the biggest tennis courts in the world,” said Djokovic on court. The run has given Paul a taste of the latter stages of a Slam which he hopes can become a regular feeling. “I mean, great, great two weeks for me. Obviously got to carry it throughout the whole season. It’s about consistency. I don’t want to be a one-hit wonder,” Paul told reporters. It was Paul’s first meeting with the 21-time Grand Slam champion and it was every bit as tough as he imagined. “I mean, walking on the court was cool. Playing the match and getting beaten like that kind of sucked,” Paul said. “But it’s great I got to see the level of where I want to be and know how good I have to play if I want to beat people like that. It was, I think, a good experience. “He didn’t really let me execute any game plan.” Amid criticism from local politicians and the Ukraine embassy, Srdjan Djokovic declined to attend the semifinal, saying he wanted to prevent “disruption” for his son. For all that, a man in the terraces held up a Ukraine flag when Djokovic served in his direction and put it away when he swapped ends. Whether or not his father’s absence was weighing on him, Djokovic was in a foul mood even as he raced to a 5-1 lead in the first set, repeatedly yelling at his players’ box in Serbian. He bickered with the chair umpire over the time taken to get a towel between points, drawing loud jeers from fans. Sensing his chance, Paul raised the pressure with some outstanding tennis, breaking the Serb twice and leveling the match at 5-5 after edging Djokovic in a 30-shot rally. However, that was as good as it got for Paul, as Djokovic knuckled down to win 14 of the last 17 games in a stunning counter-attack 15 years to the day after his first Australian Open title as a 20-year-old. “I know that without my family and my team, these things wouldn’t be possible,” said Djokovic. Sunday’s decider will be a rematch of the 2021 French Open final, which Djokovic won from two sets down to leave the Greek heartbroken. The winner will take the No. 1 ranking from Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz. “I’d like that number,” said Tsitsipas. “It’s a cornerstone final… It’s a childhood dream to be capturing the No. 1 spot one day, I’m close.” Tsitsipas can rely on a huge contingent of Greek fans to rival Djokovic’s army of Serbian supporters. They were in full voice as he traded breaks with Khachanov in a see-sawing opening set before he came alive in the tiebreak. Tsitsipas was rattled by three foot-faults and two time violations on serve but steadied to take the second set. A break down in the third, Khachanov showed great courage to fight back to 5-5 and take the tiebreak after Tsitsipas blew two match points. Tsitsipas regrouped, though, and roared to 3-0 in the last set before closing it out in dominant fashion. – Rappler.com"

Tsukii, the Philippines’ top karateka now ranked world No. 3 in the female kumite -50 kilogram category, will face a tough field made up of the finest karatekas in the world. Sixteen of the top 20 karatekas in the world, eight of whom are in the top 10, will aim to be crowned champion of the first major tournament of the year. Leading the cast are world No. 1 Yorgelis Salazar of Venezuela and second-ranked Serap Ozcelik Arapoglu of Turkey. Other notable participants are two-time world champion and world No. 7 Miyo Miyahara of Japan, 2021 world championship silver medalist and sixth-ranked Shara Hubrich of Germany, and world No. 9 and former European champion Bettina Plank of Austria, who won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics. Despite the crack list, Tsukii likes her chances of advancing deep in the competition given her familiarity with most of her opponents. Tsukii made history last year when she became the first Filipina athlete to win a gold medal in the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, United States. The Karate 1-Premier League is largely considered the most important league event in the world of karate. In 2021 when karate competitions resumed after the COVID lockdown, Tsukii twice emerged champion of the Karate 1-Premier League in Lisbon, Portugal and in Cairo, Egypt. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-next-move-appeal-icc-decision-resume-probe-drug-war-warrants-stage/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra on Friday, January 27, said the Philippines will appeal the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to resume the investigation into drug war killings. “While we have not received an official copy of this resolution, it is our intention to exhaust our legal remedies, more particularly elevating the matter to the ICC appeals chamber,” Guevarra, who was also Duterte’s former justice chief, told reporters on Friday. The solicitor general, who serves as the government’s principal lawyer, added that the Philippines’ judicial system should prevail over that of the ICC: “We wish to emphasize that our own domestic investigative and judicial processes should take precedence, and we can show that despite structural and resource limitations in our legal system, it is still a well-functioning system that yields positive results in its own time.” On Friday, the ICC moved its investigation to the warrants stage. The court’s pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the probe because it found the Philippine government’s intervention to the alleged killings unsatisfactory. During the warrants stage, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan’s office will look for evidence to potentially request the court to issue either summons or warrants. The latest ICC information did not provide specific names, but former president Rodrigo Duterte and his allies like Senator Ronald dela Rosa, have been at the center of the probe for Davao Death Squad killings and thousands of drug war deaths. In a press conference on Friday, Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said the ICC is “insulting” the Philippines, adding that the government is still unwilling to cooperate with the probe. “Well, they’re insulting us. With the many limitations as to our – to many of the things that we do in the country right now, the NBI is in the process of reorganizing, the modernization is pushing through, we’re about to hire 1,000 more agents. We are building capacity. It is a capacity building exercise that we’re doing,” Remulla said in response to a question about the ICC’s observation about the lack of vital information on drug war cases. The justice secretary said he will not welcome the ICC in the Philippines “unless they make it clear that they will respect us in this regard.” “They will have no compulsory process in the country. They will not even be empowered to issue subpoenas in the country. They have not even coordinated with us about it. So if they want to come in as a hostile government, as a hostile force, come in. But they cannot do that to us.” On multiple occasions, both the administrations of Duterte and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have said they will not cooperate with the ICC. At one point, Remulla even said that Khan is doing the ICC a “disservice” for challenging the Philippine system. Requests for a statement on the developments in the ICC have been ignored by the Palace. Malacañang was supposed to host both the justice department and interior department for a briefing on the developments in the ICC probe but the press briefing was eventually moved to the DOJ. But President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has made it clear that he has no intention of rejoining the ICC. Speaking to his wedding godchild and celebrity endorser Toni Gonzaga in September 2022, Marcos said a “whole system collapse” of government – particularly the judiciary and police – would be the only reason for the ICC to enter the Philippines. Senator Ronald dela Rosa earlier said his “future actions are dependent on the actions of this government,” while citing Marcos’ earlier pronouncements. Dela Rosa supported Marcos in the 2022 polls, sometimes campaigning alongside him as a campaign proxy for now-Vice President Sara Duterte. A briefing provided by nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) provided the next things that might happen after the ICC decided to continue the probe. HRW said Khan’s office will now start the probe, adding that there is no strict timeline that the probe follows. “It is really difficult to say and there are no strict timelines. In the past, it has varied from situation to situation: in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo), it took almost two years between the opening of the investigation and the first arrest warrant; in Georgia it was almost six years,” the rights group said. The HRW said that although the probe has already resumed, the trial will not happen soon because there is still a long process beginning from the warrants stage. “First, the prosecutor needs to conduct his investigation; then he will request the judges to issue summons to appear or arrest warrants, which sometimes are sealed; the judges then have to analyze and issue them, and the suspects need to either surrender or be arrested.” The rights group added: “Finally, before the beginning of an actual trial, there are pre-trial proceedings to confirm the charges against the accused persons.” – with reports from Bea Cupin/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/israel-hits-gaza-conflict-flares-after-west-bank-clashes/,[],"Israeli jets struck Gaza overnight on Friday, January 27, in retaliation for two rockets fired by Palestinian militants, further escalating tensions after one of the worst days of violence in the occupied West Bank in years. The rockets fired from Gaza overnight set off alarms in Israeli communities near the border with the southern coastal strip controlled by the Islamist movement Hamas but there were no reports of casualties. The cross-border fire came after an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the West Bank on Thursday, January 26, that killed at least nine Palestinians, including militant gunmen and at least two civilians, the highest single-day death toll in years. Another man died in a separate incident in al-Ramm outside Jerusalem, bringing the Palestinian death toll so far in 2023 to at least 30. The raid, the latest in a near-daily series of clashes in the West Bank over the past year, came days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to visit Israel and the West Bank. Palestinian officials said CIA director William Burns, who was visiting Israel and the West Bank on a trip arranged before the latest violence, would meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday, January 28. No comment was immediately available from US officials in Jerusalem. The months of violence, which surged after a spate of lethal attacks in Israel last year, have drawn fears the already unpredictable conflict could spiral out of control, triggering a broader confrontation between Palestinians and Israel. The US State Department issued a statement on Thursday saying it was “deeply concerned” with the violence in the West Bank and urged both sides to de-escalate the conflict. The United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have also urged calm, Palestinian officials said. In Gaza, large rallies were planned for the afternoon following Friday prayers as residents inured to years of exchanges of rockets and airstrikes between Israel and Hamas feared further clashes. “We didn’t sleep the whole night, bombing and missiles,” said 50 year-old Abdallah Al-Husary. “There is worry and there is fear, any minute a war can happen. With any clash in the West Bank, there can be war along the borders in Gaza.” In the aftermath of Thursday’s raid, the Palestinian Authority, which has limited governing powers in the West Bank, said it was suspending a security cooperation arrangement with Israel that is widely credited with helping to keep order in the territory and preventing attacks against Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned to power this year at the head of one of the most right-wing governments in Israel’s history, said Israel was not looking to escalate the situation, although he ordered security forces to be on alert. The Israeli Defense Force said Friday’s air strikes in Gaza targeted an underground rocket manufacturing site and a military base used by Hamas. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/supreme-court-decision-banning-party-list-nominees-who-previously-lost/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday, January 24, declared unconstitutional the provisions of the Party-List System Act and the Commission on Elections (Comelec) rules that ban candidates who lost in one election from being party-list nominees in the ensuing election. The Court ruled in favor of Catalina Leonen-Pizzaro and Glen Quintos Albano, who were candidates for party representatives in the 2019 elections. They questioned the constitutionality of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941, or the Party-List System Act, as well as Sections 5(d) and 10 of Comelec Resolution No. 10717, which govern the submission of nominees for groups or organizations seeking representation in the party-list system. The provisions prevented candidates for any elective office, or a person who lost a bid for elective office in the preceding election, from being included in the list of nominees in the next party list election. The petitioners also argued that Congress did not have the power to augment the qualifications that Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution provides for the House of Representatives. The SC declared invalid and unconstitutional the following phrases: The Court found that the ban on losing candidates “violates the constitutional guaranty of substantive due process, as it effectively intrudes on the right of losing candidates in the immediately preceding elections from participating in the present elections.” It is the SC’s opinion that eligibility for public office should not be based on a candidate’s failure to win in a previous election. The state should not use a failed election performance as a way to gauge a person’s ability to serve, the Court said. But the Court did rule that Congress has the power to provide for the qualifications of party list representatives based on Section 5(1), Article VI of the Constitution. Still, Congress must yield to the general limitations on legislation, particularly its duty to equal protection, the SC said. The SC held that the questioned provisions must be struck down, “as no substantial distinction exists between candidates who lost in the immediately preceding election vis-a-vis those who won or did not participate therein.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/status-kadiwa-program-marcos-jr-administration-january-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has made bringing down the price of basic goods and services as one of his priorities, symbolized by his taking on the agriculture portfolio. One of Marcos’ plans to achieve this is through the Kadiwa Program, in which agricultural products produced by Farmers and Fisherfolk Cooperatives and Associations (FCAs) and Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) are brought by the government directly to consumers through strategically located Kadiwa stores. Here’s a look at the well-publicized Kadiwa Program. Not all Kadiwa stores are the same. The Kadiwa store near you might be different from the one in your neighboring village, town, or city. An official of the Department of Agriculture – Agribusiness and Marketing Assistance Service (DA-AMAS), who requested anonymity, explained that there are two main modalities under the Kadiwa Program: Kadiwa retail selling and Kadiwa online. The Kadiwa stores that people see in their localities are under Kadiwa retail selling, which is further broken down into three sub-categories – Kadiwa stores, Kadiwa pop-up stores, and Kadiwa on wheels: How many people are reached or served by Kadiwa outlets? The DA-AMAS official told Rappler that in 2022, the Kadiwa Program served a total of 1.82 million households, conducted 34,794 selling activities, and generated P621 million in sales. It would be hard to determine how many repeat buyers there were among these households. Regardless, the Kadiwa program has not been able to serve all 5.6 million poor families in 2022, based on the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s Listahan 3 survey. Records from the DA-AMAS show that there are currently 215 Kadiwa stores, 60 Kadiwa pop-up stores, and 23 Kadiwa on wheels nationwide. Former socio-economic planning secretary and economics professor Solita Winnie Monsod is not impressed by the impact of Kadiwa stores in relation to the upsurge in onion prices which has affected all households. She cited a particular incident where onions, which the DA bought at P140 million from a multi-purpose cooperative at a reported price of P537 per kilo, were sold in the Kadiwa stores at P170 per kilo. “Each customer was allowed to buy 1 kg. Do the arithmetic, Reader. The P140 million could buy 260,707.6 kgs of onions. Assuming they sold it all (it seems they didn’t spend the whole amount), and assuming that each kg. sold represented one family, that means 261,000 families were accommodated. Compare that with the 25 million families in the Philippines,” she said in a recent blog on the high prices of onions. “Management by illusion,” said Monsod, recalling what former Marcos executive secretary Rafael Salas (who would later exit his Cabinet) said of his boss’ leadership style. The Kadiwa Program was already revived twice by two chief executives: former presidents Joseph Estrada and Rodrigo Duterte. Although Marcos’ Kadiwa Program is an extension of Duterte’s reboot of the program, the reason why Kadiwa is so close to Marcos Jr.’s heart is that it was first implemented during his father’s presidency. According to an article published by VERA Files, the birth of Kadiwa stores can be attributed to the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 which resulted in soaring food prices. Jürgen Rüland, said in a 1986 article in the Asian Journal of Public Administration, that the inspiration for the Kadiwa Program was the “rolling stores” project of the Metropolitan Manila Commission (MMC) in 1979. At the time, the MMC was led by Imelda Marcos, wife of then-president Ferdinand E. Marcos and mother of the current president. In his book, From Parastatals to Private Trade: Lessons from Asian Agriculture, Ramon L. Clarete said that after the elder Marcos designated Imelda as National Food Authority head, the agency launched the Kadiwa Program. The original Kadiwa Program, just like today, operated mobile and retail stores where basic food items like rice, sugar, cooking oil, coffee, milk, and noodles were sold at subsidized prices. However, while the Kadiwa Program had its pros, it also had its cons. Leandro A. Viloria and Dolores A. Endriga, in their perception study published in the October 1984 issue of the Philippine Planning Journal, said that many poor families were discouraged from buying from Kadiwa stores due to long queues, and many of the stores were not near their households. In some localities, there were no Kadiwa stores at all. “Distance, time and money involved in going to other areas for the service prevented the poor from availing of the program,” Viloria and Endriga said in the study. These reasons led to many people preferring alternatives to the Kadiwa stores like going to nearer wet and dry markets for lower transportation expenses, aside from having “sukis” (frequented sellers) who gave discounts from time to time. The study also noted that those who only needed a few items depended on “sari-sari” (small neighborhood) stores because, unlike Kadiwa Stores, they could buy items on credit from these stores. The three types of Kadiwa stores under the Kadiwa retail selling modality have different sources of funding, the DA-AMAS official said. Kadiwa stores have the biggest slice of the program’s budget. The Enhanced Kadiwa Grant, which is given to FCAs and CBOs under this category, had a P300 million budget in 2022 and a P750 million budget in 2023. According to the same official, the beneficiaries of this mode are from FCAs, CBOs, state universities (SUCs), and local government units (LGUs). These beneficiaries apply for the grant to establish a Kadiwa store. If the FCAs and CBOs cannot comply with the requirements for the grant, they can apply through their respective LGUs. The two other types of Kadiwa stores under the same modality had a combined budget of P35,521,000 in 2022 and P18,125,000 in 2023. The Kadiwa stores are not intended to be permanent. Marcos said that the Kadiwa stores will only remain open until the prices of basic commodities have stabilized. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Philippines’ inflation rate soared to 8.1% in December 2022, the highest since November 2008. “Once we get to a point where it’s no longer necessary, where the prices in the markets are the same as what we can give in the Kadiwa, then we don’t need the Kadiwa anymore,” Marcos told reporters on December 1, 2022. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/human-rights-groups-statements-icc-drug-war-probe-resumption/,['JODESZ GAVILAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Human rights groups on Friday, January 27, welcomed the “much awaited” decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to resume the investigation into the violent war on drugs under former president Rodrigo Duterte. The Philippine Coalition for the International Criminal Court (PCICC) said that the move “brings light amid darkness” as justice continues to be out of reach for thousands of victims and their families. It called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to also hold the Duterte government accountable for its human rights abuses. “The Philippine government should now realize that diplomatic runs and rhetorics on justice will not stop the ICC to do its work to deliver justice for serious crimes in international law,” PCICC co-chairperson Aurora Parong said in a statement. “The ICC does not need general statements, it needs evidence that there are serious criminal prosecutions for specific cases in the Philippines,” she added. The ICC pre-trial chamber on Thursday night Dutch time, January 26, announced that it’s “not satisfied that the Philippines is undertaking relevant investigations that would warrant a deferral of the Court’s investigations on the basis of the complementarity principle.” This move means that the office of ICC prosecutor Karim Khan can continue its investigation to seek more evidence that could potentially request the issuance of summons or warrants to those involved in the drug war. While it is not yet clear who would be the subject of these possible issuances, the ICC is usually interested in high-ranking officials. For Fr. Flavie Villanueva, an activist-priest who helps the families of drug war victims, the recent ICC development means Duterte cannot run away from his alleged crimes. “The ICC’s most recent decision to re-open its investigation of the bloody war-on-drugs orchestrated by former President Duterte and his cohorts speaks loud and clear that ‘you cannot run away from your past sins,'” the priest said in a statement. He added: “Personally, my invitation to him, ‘if you are one who truly does not back out from trouble, come face this investigation and let the Truth stand.’ For truly, you cannot run from your past sins.” Karapatan hoped the ICC would continue its proceedings until Duterte is “convicted and punished” for his violent drug war. “This should also serve as a warning to the current regime for essentially continuing Duterte’s policies on the drug war,” Karapatan secretary-general Cristina Palabay said. “With the help of international mechanisms provided by bodies like the ICC, we can make a dent on the culture of impunity that has stymied the quest for justice for so long,” Palabay added. The group also said that other international bodies, particularly the United Nations Human Rights Council, should see this as a signal to conduct its own independent investigation. Despite the efforts of stakeholders, the extent that the council had done was to provide “technical assistance” to the Philippine government despite the continued rising number of deaths. Official government data shows that at least 6,252 people had died at the hands of the police during anti-illegal drug operations as of May 31, 2022 – a month before Duterte left office in June of the same year. This tally does not include victims of vigilante-style killings, which human rights groups estimate to pull the number up to around 30,000. Human Rights Watch (HRW) welcomed the latest move of the ICC, as it is the “only credible avenue for justice for the victims and their families.” “The ICC offers a path forward to fill the accountability vacuum,” HRW deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said. A May 2020 report by HRW detailed the “harmful consequences” on children left behind by victims of Duterte’s war on drugs. It documented “drastic changes” in children, including those brought about by psychological distress. The Philippine Human Rights Center (PhilRights) said the latest ICC move “offers hope” to the victims, who can be expected to support the investigation. “It also reveals the Philippine government’s belated efforts to investigate for the hollow gesture that it is,” PhilRights executive director Nymia Simbulan said. “We call on all Filipinos to join this call for justice and demand an absolute end to all state-sponsored violence,” she added. – Rappler.com"

Shawn Glover delivered a double-double of 31 points, 13 rebounds, 2 blocks, and 2 steals as the Bossing ended a seven-game skid dating back to last conference despite frittering away a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The Fuel Masters used a 29-18 run capped by a Tyler Tio bucket in the fourth quarter to erase a 69-79 deficit and seize a 98-97 lead with under two minutes remaining. Glover and JVee Casio, though, knocked down key buckets down the stretch that gave Blackwater enough separation to clinch its first victory since October. The Bossing kept the comeback door ajar after missing 3 of its 10 free throws in the final 30 seconds, with Glover splitting his foul shots for a 108-105 edge with six ticks left, but Phoenix failed to capitalize. Baser Amer backstopped Glover in scoring with 17 points, while rookie Ato Ular produced a double-double for the second straight game with 14 points and 11 rebounds to compensate for the absence of forward Troy Rosario. Rosario missed the first two games of the conference due to foot injury. Du’Vaughn Maxwell put the Fuel Masters on his back with 37 points, 17 rebounds, 6 blocks, and 4 assists, erupting for 14 points in their fourth-quarter comeback.

Michele Boccoz told Philippine media that Marcos had accepted the invitation from French President Emmanuel Macron. A state visit is the highest type of visit a head of state can undertake. It only happens upon invitation of the host country and involves more pomp and pageantry as compared to other forms of visits, such as working or official visits. State visits also mean it’s the host country that will shoulder most, if not all of the cost of the visit. According to state-run Philippine News Agency, the visit is set to take place by the first half of the year, although other details have yet to be ironed out. Boccoz said priority areas of engagement for the two countries include food security, energy, maritime security, climate change, biodiversity, and people-to-people ties. Marcos and Macron formally met the first time on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Bangkok, Thailand back in November 2022. This trip would be Marcos’ third state visit in 2023 to date, and his fifth overall. His first state visits were to Indonesia and Singapore in September 2022, then to China in January 2023. He is set to have a state visit Japan in February 2023. Marcos, who assumed the presidency last June 30, 2022, has been criticized for his frequent trips abroad. Between his state visits, he has also travelled overseas on working or official visits to the United States, Cambodia, Thailand, Belgium, and Switzerland. Between his trip to the US and Cambodia, Marcos also went on a Singapore sojourn to watch Formula 1 Grand Prix. That trip was unannounced and was confirmed only by the Palace after various media reports and posts on social media. Following his five-day visit to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, Marcos told a media panel: “‘Yung mga biyahe medyo babawasan na namin for the rest of the year (We’ll lessen the amount of trips for the rest of the year).” In November 2022, after participating in the APEC Summit, Marcos told traveling media that they had accepted “all” state visit invites, but that it was a matter of scheduling. Aside from the February 2023 Japan state visit and the upcoming state visit to France, Marcos is set to return to the US for the APEC Summit in November 2023. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-response-icc-probe-drug-war-warrants-stage/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Former president Rodrigo Duterte, through his former spokesperson Harry Roque, said he will not allow “foreigners” to judge him after the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced it is resuming the probe into the drug war killings. “Former President Duterte reiterates his position that he would never allow foreigners to sit in judgment of him as long as Philippine courts are willing and able to do so,” Roque said, adding that Duterte “shrugged off” the ICC’s latest move. On Friday, the ICC moved its investigation to the warrants stage, which means its pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the probe because it was not satisfied with the Philippine government’s intervention in the alleged killings. Duterte is at the center of the probe – both for the Davao Death Squad (DDS) killings and his bloody drug war implemented by the Philippine National Police. As Davao City mayor, the DDS flourished under Duterte, and became known for carrying out orders to kill people – including those that allegedly came from no other than Duterte. Former cop, DDS member, and whistleblower Arturo Lascañas said in his affidavit that he “killed for Duterte.” Another important witness, Edgar Matobato, also a self-confessed DDS member, testified that Duterte instructed them to execute people. Meanwhile, the government said there have been 6,252 people who have died at the hands of the police during anti-illegal drug operations between July 2016 and May 31, 2022 – under Duterte’s term. Human rights groups refute this, saying actual numbers could reach 30,000 if vigilante-style killings are included. Roque said Duterte would submit himself to the “prosecution and judgment of any local court,” but will not subject himself to a foreign body. The former Palace spokesperson added Duterte is ready to face his accusers. “But the former chief executive would never subject himself under the legal jurisdiction of any foreign body because it is an insult to the competence and impartiality of our functioning criminal justice system.” The government has repeatedly claimed that the ICC, being an international body, has no jurisdiction over the Philippines. However, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan already refuted it and said there’s nothing in the Rome Statute that states the Philippines can “challenge the resumption of an investigation on jurisdictional or gravity grounds at this stage of proceedings.” Although the Duterte administration unilaterally withdrew membership from the ICC, Article 127 of the Rome Statute states that all proceedings prior to the withdrawal remain valid – the same position taken by the Philippine Supreme Court. In reality, even for high-profile drug war cases, justice has been elusive. Since 2016, there were only two significant convictions in the drug war cases: one for Kian delos Santos, where cops were convicted in 2018, and another for Carl Angelo Arnaiz and Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, where cops were only convicted in 2022 of torture and planting of evidence. The murder case of Arnaiz and De Guzman is still pending before a Navotas court, as of 2023 – six years after they were brutally killed. The report recently published by the ICC also said that the domestic initiatives and proceedings “do not amount to tangible, concrete, and progressive investigative steps” in a way that mirrors the ICC’s probe. Khan also earlier called the DOJ’s drug war review a mere “desk review.” In his statement, Roque said he supports Duterte’s stand that the local justice system is working: “I support former President Duterte’s firm stand. Our domestic courts are willing and able to carry out fair proceedings vis-à-vis cases related to the war on drugs campaign.” Roque also said the resumption of the ICC probe is a waste of resources, and that the ICC should focus on other countries like Ukraine. Roque added that Duterte has repeatedly urged the drug war victims to file a case before the local courts. Many have refused to come forward, fearful for their lives. (READ: Drug war widow: Why is Duterte still free, when our loved ones are dead?) President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who ran in 2022 promising to “continue” the supposed gains of the Duterte administration, has said that there are no plans to rejoin the ICC, citing the same reasons as Duterte. “The ICC very simply is supposed to take action when a country no longer has a functioning judiciary, has no longer some…the organs of state, the police…. That condition does not exist in the Philippines. So I do not see why…what role ICC is going to play here in the Philippines,” Marcos had said in a sit-down interview with his wedding godchild and celebrity endorser Toni Gonzaga in September 2022. Despite requests from media, the Palace has not issued a statement on the ICC’s most recent move. Meanwhile, Senator Ronald dela Rosa, among the chief architects of Duterte’s “drug war,” said that his “future actions are depending on the actions of this government.” Dela Rosa supported Marcos in the 2022 elections and often campaigned alongside him as one of Vice President Sara Duterte’s campaign substitutes. – with reports from Bea Cupin/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/bea-alonzo-response-being-friends-again-gerald-anderson/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Bea Alonzo said there would be no chance she would be friends again with ex-boyfriend Gerald Anderson. In an episode of Fast Talk with Boy Abunda on Thursday, January 26, she was asked if she would ever rekindle her friendship with Gerald. Bea gave a no, saying she could “never be friends with somebody she doesn’t trust,” and “somebody who doesn’t take responsibility for his actions.” After watching Gerald’s interview with Boy Abunda in March 2021, Bea said that her feelings were hurt as she is, after all, human. In 2019, Gerald also revealed in an ABS-CBN interview that he realized his relationship with Bea was “no longer healthy” and “that you’re just hurting each other and [that] you don’t want it anymore.” Bea also expressed relief that Tito Boy expressed concern about Bea’s feelings after that interview. “Kung sino man ang i-interview-hin siya at that time, it would hurt especially if half the time, he wasn’t telling the truth,” Bea said. She did however admit that she broke down in tears after the exclusive interview was aired, as it hurt her a lot. “Pero dahil tao din ako at natututo din ako, na-realize ko that it’s part of your job. As a great interviewer, alam ko na both sides of the story, kailangan mong malaman,” Bea added. (Because I’m human and I’m able to learn, I realized that it’s part of your job. As a great interviewer, I know that you need to know both sides of the story.) “This is part of my past. Of course, parte siya ng pagkatao ko,” Bea said. (It is now is part of who I am as a person). Rumors that the celebrity couple broke up started when Bea made several cryptic posts alluding to betrayal and hurt. In a chance interview with media, Bea later said that Gerald just stopped speaking to her. Their high-profile relationship came to a controversial end in 2019. Fans speculated that Gerald had cheated on Bea with his Between Maybes co-star Julia Barretto, after they were seen together at a party. Gerald and Julia initially denied being involved in any cheating. The two made their relationship public shortly after. In 2021, Bea said that she was “gaslit” and “cheated on” by Gerald. In the same year, after months of speculation, Bea confirmed her relationship with actor Dominic Roque in August. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/buzzfeed-help-generate-content-for-facebook-deal-expand-ai-use-wsj/,['GELO GONZALES'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Wednesday, January 25 (US time), reported details about an agreement between Meta and BuzzFeed for the latter to help generate creator content (paywalled) for Facebook and Instagram. The agreement is said to be part of a $10-million deal that was signed in 2022, with both companies looking to capitalize on the creator economy, which sees individual users building audiences on social media platforms by uploading videos and other forms of content, and monetizing these followings with partnerships and sponsorships with brands. BuzzFeed will also be providing training to creators to help them build audiences, and is “helping creators understand what makes content resonate widely.” The report added that BuzzFeed had historically been among the publishers that Facebook had looked to in order to understand trends and internet culture. In 2016, Meta paid $50 million to a number of publishers, including BuzzFeed, to generate live video content, which had been a big trend at the time. Facebook faces a challenge in TikTok, whose users and their videos drew in more than a billion monthly active users in 2022. Meta’s deal with BuzzFeed is an attempt to make more effective creators in terms of drawing and keeping eyes glued to its platforms. The WSJ followed up on the report on the Meta-BuzzFeed deal about the latter’s interest in using more AI-enabled tools (paywalled) in 2023, including those from OpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. One example of the company’s proposed uses of AI includes personalized quizzes that can generate unique write-ups out of a user’s responses. CEO Jonah Peretti in a memo to employees and reviewed by the WSJ, said he expected AI to assist in the creative process, with humans playing the role of providing ideas with “inspired prompts.” In 15 years, he expects AI to be advanced enough to help “create, personalize, and animate the content itself.” Some employees have expressed concern about the memo, specifically with regards to the current issues surrounding the use of copyrighted artwork in training art-generating AI, whether the use of AI would mean a reduction in the BuzzFeed workforce, and concerns on fact-checking AI-generated content. At a meeting, Peretti was said to have told staff that BuzzFeed’s approach would be to make creative use of AI technology, and that using it merely to cut costs and produce low-quality content would be a terrible use of the technology. – Rappler.com."
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-fastest-economic-growth-46-years-context-caveats/,['JC PUNONGBAYAN'],"Economic officials gleefully reported on January 26 that the Philippine economy grew by 7.6% for the entire 2022. They pointed out that that’s the fastest growth on record since 1976, or in 46 years (Figure 1). It’s also a little over their 2022 target of 6.5-7.5%. At the same time, they boasted that the economy grew by 7.2% in the last quarter of 2022, despite skyrocketing prices. What can we make of these numbers? Is the economy truly in tip-top shape? Not entirely. Data suggest that we could, in fact, be growing a lot faster than this. So, 7.6% is arguably disappointing. Let me share with you here some context and caveats behind the numbers. First, growth is so high in 2022 because the economy dropped so low during the pandemic. Recall that in 2020, total production – as measured by GDP or gross domestic product – dropped by almost 10%. That’s the worst economic downturn of the Philippines since the 14% decline during Martial Law in 1984 and 1985 (believe it or not, that crisis remains the country’s worst postwar recession, even taking into account the pandemic). Figure 2 shows that as of 2021, total output was still 4% below the pre-pandemic level in 2019. It was not until late 2022 that GDP went back to its 2019 levels. Do you remember 2021 – or was it all a blur? Our economy was still under much stress then. Lockdowns were still in place, we were still wearing face shields, mass vaccination was just getting started, children were still having classes online (they didn’t go back to school until November 2022), and the Duterte government was still denying the poor aid or ayuda. That’s the economy we are comparing against to compute the 2022 growth rate of 7.6%. We were coming from such a low base in 2021, so naturally any recovery in 2022 will register as a sizable growth rate. Long story short, the 7.6% growth in 2022 still bears this so-called “base effect.” One of my Twitter mutuals, Doc Ligot, unearthed an old tweet of mine back in January 29, 2021: “I’m worried about base effects. For sure gov’t will trumpet the ‘impressive’ growth rates no end.” True enough… But now that our lives are returning to normal (traffic is so bad again, kids are back to school, etc.), such base effects will disappear in 2023, and this year we’ll see the true nature of growth. Magkakaalaman na. Apart from base effects, another thing that propped up growth in 2022 is the so-called “pent-up demand,” more popularly known as “revenge spending.” After two years under lockdown (2020 and 2021), Filipinos just couldn’t wait to go out, eat at restaurants, book hotels and flights, and spend their money in 2022 – anything to give them a sense of normalcy, to try out things they haven’t done in two years.  Higher demand means more consumption, and therefore more spending and income and production. Hence, high growth. People also seem to be spending despite rising prices of certain commodities like bread and vegetables like red onions, and despite not having too much savings. (READ: Inflation, ’di hadlang sa gastos ng mga Pinoy?) Yet another thing made 2022 special: elections happened. And historically, elections bring about a boost in spending especially in the first quarter (January to March). Figure 3 shows that growth clocked in at 8.15% in the first quarter of 2022. Note, though, that growth has been declining since then. In fact, the 7.2% growth in the last quarter of 2022 was the year’s lowest. The thing is, growth in 2022 could have been a lot higher had President Bongbong Marcos done his job to abate inflation. You see, if prices are skyrocketing, you’re more likely to have second thoughts about eating out at a restaurant or booking flights. Many analysts surmised that inflation might have eaten away at growth in 2022. This is somewhat validated in the data. Figure 4 shows that the growth of private households’ consumption slowed down throughout 2022. In the 4th quarter, consumption spending contributed less than half of what it did in the 1st quarter. Spending on transportation and restaurants is also a lot lower in the last quarter of 2022. Aside from consumption, investment spending is also a huge driver of growth historically. But investments have contributed a lot less to growth in recent quarters (Figure 5). Even if the economy is reopening a lot, many investors may be thinking twice before investing huge sums into new operations, or expanding their current operations, because of the rising costs of inputs like construction materials or parts used in manufacturing. High inflation is painful for investors, too. If the Marcos government really wants to prop up growth in 2023, they need to address inflation once and for all – something they’ve miserably failed to do and pay attention to in 2022. (A few weeks in office, Marcos Jr. “disagreed” with the latest inflation statistics then, adding, “We’re not that high…”) In terms of sectors, the bright spot continues to be the service sector (Figure 6). Services grew a lot in 2022, but that’s easy to understand because they suffered a lot during the lockdowns. (Remember the crises among, say, PUV drivers and salespersons when transportation and malls closed down.) Now that the economy has all but fully reopened, most service workers are back in business. But note as well in Figure 6 that industry’s contribution to growth has been declining since early 2022. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector even shrank by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2022, and this manifested in the short supply of basic agricultural commodities like red onions. This reflects terribly on the agriculture secretary, who happens to be Marcos Jr. himself. Time to appoint a full-time secretary? Finally, the 7.6% growth is not so impressive compared to the 9.18% growth needed for us to fully recover and get back on our feet completely. You see, more than getting back to its pre-pandemic level, GDP needs to go back to its pre-pandemic trajectory. Other economies, like the US, have already fully recovered in this sense. Sadly, we’re still a long way off from that. Last year I projected that the Philippine economy must grow yearly at a rate of 9.18% per year, from 2023 all the way up to 2028, if we are to return to the pre-pandemic trajectory of output by the end of Marcos Jr.’s administration. But now that 2022 growth has come in at just 7.6%, we will now need to grow by 9.44% yearly until 2028 if full recovery is to be met within the Marcos Jr. administration (Figure 7). If the Marcos government settles with 7.6% growth annually, Figure 7 shows we will never converge with our pre-pandemic trajectory. In that sense, the economic scars from the pandemic will prove deep and permanent. Sad. Achieving 9.44% growth yearly is a feat I doubt the Marcos administration will ever achieve – and one they definitely can’t achieve by just resorting to their PR machinery. They can’t vlog their way out of this one. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of the forthcoming book, False Nostalgia: The Marcos Golden Age Myths and How to Debunk Them.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/pido-jarencio-likely-set-ust-growling-tigers-head-coach-return/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Pido Jarencio is likely set for a return to the collegiate ranks as the new head coach of the UST Growling Tigers, a source confirmed on Friday, January 27. This development comes on the heels of Bal David’s resignation from UST just last Thursday, January 26, and NorthPort team manager Bonnie Tan’s switch with Jarencio to the Batang Pier head coaching post last January 13. If the move comes to fruition, Jarencio will retake control of a UST basketball program that recently finished last place with a 1-13 record in the UAAP Season 85 men’s basketball tournament. Set to enter his ninth season as the Growling Tigers’ head coach, Jarencio brought in some rookie magic back in 2006 after leading UST to its 18th UAAP basketball championship, forging a second-place tie with the school’s longtime rival UE Red Warriors. Although the Tigers stayed in the title hunt for the next seven seasons, the program was unable to relive its Season 69 peak. Jarencio then resigned in 2013 after two consecutive finals appearances in Seasons 75 and 76, losing back-to-back to rival schools Ateneo and La Salle. In eight seasons total, Jarencio tallied a 58-54 win-loss record with one championship, three finals stints, and two missed Final Four berths. If his return is finalized, the 58-year-old mentor is set to guide a hungry Growling Tiger pack led by rising star Nic Cabanero and reinforcement Adama Faye. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/army-nbi-police-work-chua-plaza-murder-case/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – It was an Army board that got several suspects in the shocking murder of Davao City-based businesswoman and model Yvonette Chua Plaza to confess, while the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) extracted much of the electronic evidence to help the police in building a case against former Presidential Security Group (PSG) chief Brigadier General Jesus Durante III and his subordinates. The collaboration, with authorities getting a boost because of a P1-million reward given by concerned citizens, resulted in the filing of the complaint against Durante, his deputy commander, several other soldiers, and a civilian, Special Investigation Task Group Yvonette spokesperson Major Eudisan Gultiano told Rappler on Friday, January 27. Authorities submitted a complaint against the suspects to Davao prosecutors on Wednesday, January 25, less than a month after Plaza was killed in a gun attack outside her Green Meadows home in Davao City’s Tugbok District. It was the same day they identified Durante as the alleged brains behind the murder. Gultiano said witnesses, all of them civilians, went to the police to identify the soldiers who allegedly carried out the December 29, 2022 gun attack right after the Davao City Police Office (DCPO) announced a P1-million reward for informers. With some of the suspects identified, the special team of police investigators proceeded with their work on the Plaza case, while a military board of inquiry pressed a group of soldiers under the Army’s 1001st Brigade for information. “They confessed to the military board of inquiry,” said Gultiano. The NBI, meanwhile, worked to extract pieces of digital information which helped establish her and Durante’s links. On Wednesday, Davao regional police director Brigadier General Benjamin Silo Jr. called it a “tight case,” and added that the “clarity of circumstance” and the extra-judicial confessions “interlocked.” The confession of the alleged triggerman offered the most damning revelation so far. Sergeant Delfin Sialsa Jr., who was among the first suspects to surrender and confess to the crime, alleged that it was Durante’s close aide, Colonel Michael Licyayo, who ordered the burning of the victim’s belongings after the murder. Police have filed a complaint for murder and obstruction of justice against Licyayo who served as deputy commander of the 1001st Infantry Brigade under Durante. The general was facing similar charges. Sialsa alleged that it was Licyayo who relayed Durante’s supposed order, and provided information and logistical support so they could stage the fatal gun attack. He claimed that he handed over the victim’s personal belongings to Colonel Licyayo, who then allegedly ordered another suspect, Staff Sergeant Gilbert Plaza, to burn them. Sialsa alleged that the victim’s belongings, which he claimed he took after pulling the trigger, included a handbag containing her smartphone, a credit card, and an identification card. Davao-based broadcaster 91.5 Brigada News FM reported that Sialsa, in his extra-judicial confession, alleged that the ID showed that the victim had been a PSG consultant. Durante was appointed as the PSG commander in February 2020, two years before former President Rodrigo Duterte stepped down from Malacanang. “We have no way of knowing that because the ID was burned. That is not in the complaint we filed,” said Major Gultiano. She said it could have been part of unvalidated information that Plaza had worked as a writer for Durante. “It does not have anything to do with the case,” Gultiano said. Meanwhile, police filed a complaint for murder and theft against Sialsa and Corporal Adrian Cachero, who allegedly served as the driver of the motorcycle used during the gun attack. Also accused by the police of murder are Staff Sergeant Plaza, Private 1st class Rolly Cabal, Private 1st class Romart Longakit, civilian Noel H. Japitan, and two John Does. Staff Sergeant Plaza, in addition to being accused of murder, was also slapped with an obstruction of justice complaint for allegedly burning the victim’s belongings. Longakit and Japitan were also accused of murder, while the two John Does – one referred to as “Junior” and the other as “Master Sergeant” – were facing charges for obstruction of justice. Sialsa’s group turned over the murder weapon – a military-issued caliber .45 pistol – and the clothing they wore on the night of the killing, which, police said, further strengthened their case against the suspects. Brigadier General Silo said other key evidence included CCTV footage and photographs that were consistent with accounts of the incident. Plaza’s family had also turned over her laptop to authorities, which provided further useful information. The laptop reportedly contained Plaza’s contacts, intimate photos, and showed her email exchanges with Durante. Silo said that Durante allegedly had an affair with Plaza, and described the murder as a “crime of passion.” It was also alleged that Durante paid the rent for the victim’s home. Without providing further details, Silo said investigators had also discovered that Plaza had “sensitive information” that she had used to blackmail the general. Silo said the team of investigators, in collaboration with the Army and NBI, had ensured that all the requirements of the prosecutors had been met so that a case could be brought to court. – Rappler.com"

The two pilots on board died in the accident. While the cause of the accident is being determined, other similar aircraft are grounded as a standard procedure in the investigation. (READ: 2 killed in Bataan military plane crash) Which aircraft does the PAF use in training? How many are currently in use? Due to the costly price of the purchase and maintenance of aircraft, some planes in service often double as training planes. On the PAF’s website, there are three trainer-classified planes in active use: The American Cessna T-41 Mescalero, as well as the Italian SIAI-Marchetti S-211 (redesignated to AS-211) and SIAI-Marchetti SF-260. In undergoing training, pilots must fly the T-41 for primary training, move to the SF-260 for basic flight training, and finally fly the AS-211 for advanced training. The AS-211 is a jet trainer aircraft, meaning that it is powered by a turbine fan or turbofan. The SF-260, on the other hand, is fitted with a turboprop engine. The main difference between the two aircraft is their design. The SF-260 has an external “prop” or blade in front of the craft, while the AS-211 uses an internal blade inside its engine. 15 T-41 trainer planes were donated to the Philippines by South Korea in March 2009. 24 brand-new AS-211 jets were acquired from Italy in 1989, but only 3 remain in service due to attrition and a lack of available spare parts. The last 3 jets were recently utilized for training after being replaced by 12 South Korean FA-50PH jets in July 2022. The SF-260TP variant was first used on July 1, 1993. There are 21 SF-260 planes currently in service, according to the 2022 Directory of World Air Forces. The PAF opened bidding to supply engine parts for 2 of its SF-260TPs in 2018. Both Italian planes saw combat action during the 2017 Marawi siege. At least 10 Filipino soldiers were killed by a friendly airstrike, with the New York Times reporting that the AS-11 jet was used during the strike. – Rappler.com"

Prawit, an adept political dealmaker in Thailand’s conservative establishment and current deputy prime minister, will likely go against the Pheu Thai Party’s Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of self-exiled former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, who has declared her readiness for the top job. “He is the center of the party…our members, parliamentarians all see him as talented and most suitable,” Palang Pracharat’s deputy leader Paiboon Nititawan said after a party meeting. Prawit, 77, could also face off with incumbent prime minister and protege Prayuth Chan-ocha, 68, who has joined the United Thai Nation Party and has hinted at a bid to extend his rule, which started with a coup he led eight years ago. Both are former army chiefs who often refer to each other as brothers, hailing from the elite Queen’s Guard unit. Both were involved in coups against governments controlled by the Shinawatra family. Prawit could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday but when asked last week if he was ready to be premier, he said: “Just vote for me.” In a Facebook post on Wednesday, January 25, Prawit said “politicians must be able to work with all parties, compromise to reduce conflict and adhere to the public interest.” Despite sharing a conservative electoral base, some observers say the two generals running for different parties could be strategic and advantageous in ensuring they stay in power. “There is a strong likelihood that they will work together during and after the vote,” said Ben Kiatkwankul, partner at government affairs advisory, Maverick Consulting Group. A “divide and conquer” strategy might work, he added, with Prawit’s party able to win votes in areas where Prayuth may not be popular. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-semifinal-results-stefanos-tsitsipas-karen-khachanov-january-27-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Stefanos Tsitsipas blazed his way into a first Australian Open final with a 7-6(2), 6-4, 6-7(6), 6-3 win over Russian 18th seed Karen Khachanov on Friday, January 27. Greek third seed Tsitsipas, who had crashed three times at the semifinal stage at Melbourne Park, will play either favorite Novak Djokovic or Tommy Paul for the title. Winning his first Grand Slam crown on Sunday would see Tsitsipas take the No. 1 spot from Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz, who is absent from the tournament due to injury. “I’d like that number,” Tsitsipas said. “These are the moments that I have been working hard for, to be able to play in finals like this, but finals that have a bigger meaning than just the final. So it’s a cornerstone final. “I’m fighting for the No. 1 spot. It’s a childhood dream to be capturing the No. 1 spot one day, I’m close.” Playing in glorious sunshine on Rod Laver Arena, the 2021 French Open runner-up forced an error on the Khachanov forehand to grab an early break only to immediately surrender his serve. The pair traded breaks again in a see-sawing opening set but Tsitsipas came alive in the tiebreak and surged ahead in the match before getting his nose in front in the next set when Khachanov’s level dropped. Despite being rattled by three foot faults and two time violations on serve, Tsitsipas looked more comfortable after wining the second set. The 24-year-old broke Khachanov for a 2-1 lead in the third but the Russian bravely drew level at 5-5 before it went to a tiebreak. Tsitsipas hit two superb inside-out forehands to draw roars from the crowd but squandered two match points and allowed Khachanov to take the set. The Greek regrouped in the fourth set to go 3-0 up and finished the match in style to claim a place in his second Grand Slam final. “I’ve been wanting for many years now to put Greek tennis on the map, and me and Maria (Sakkari) have done an incredible job,” Tsitsipas said. “I know it probably doesn’t mean as much for Australians because they’ve been always producing players and they’ve always had their fair share of top players but coming from a small country like Greece I’m so grateful I get some more like this.” Looking to join him in the final is Djokovic, who is bidding for a record-extending 10th Australian Open title and 22nd Grand Slam to equal Rafa Nadal, but the Serbian great will not have his father in the stands in the evening semifinal. Srdjan Djokovic said he would not attend his son’s match and would instead “watch from home” after a video emerged showing him posing at Melbourne Park with fans holding Russian flags on Wednesday. Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete as individual athletes without national affiliation at the tournament, though their flags are banned from the grounds after a complaint by Ukraine’s ambassador last week. The video caused controversy in Australia, leading to the country’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reiterating Australian support for Ukraine and criticizing supporters of Russia’s invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation.” Srdjan Djokovic said he did not want to be a distraction. “I am here to support my son only,” he said in an emailed statement. “I had no intention of causing such headlines or disruption. “So there is no disruption to tonight’s semifinal for my son or for the other player, I have chosen to watch from home.” Earlier on Friday, Brazilian pair Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos beat India’s Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna, 7-6(2), 6-2 ,to win the mixed doubles final, with the result marking the end of Mirza’s Grand Slam career. “I’ve had the privilege to come back here again and again, and win tournaments and play some great finals,” an emotional Mirza said. “Rod Laver Arena has been special in my life and I couldn’t think of a better arena to finish my career at a Grand Slam.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/korean-popular-music/all-six-momoland-members-leave-mld-entertainment/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – All six members of K-pop girl group Momoland are leaving MLD Entertainment after having “a long discussion” with the agency. MLD Entertainment made the announcement on Friday, January 27, in a statement published on Korean platform Naver. In the statement, the agency said it had a discussion with the girl group members, after which they “agreed to terminate the exclusive contract upon expiration of the contract period.” “We would like to express our deep gratitude to Momoland, who has been with us for a long time, and we will sincerely wish the best for the members’ future endeavors,” MLD Entertainment said. Momoland is made up of Hyebin, Jane, Nayun, JooE, Ahin, and Nancy. They debuted in 2016 and originally had seven members, with former member Yeonwoo as part of the lineup. In 2017, the group expanded to nine members with the addition of Daisy and Taeha, though they would also eventually depart, leaving the group with its current lineup. Momoland’s debut mini album Welcome to Momoland was released in November 2016, while their first studio album Chiri Chiri was released in September 2019. The group is known for their songs “Bboom Bboom,” “Baam,” and “Pinky Love.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/cops-urged-testify-against-most-responsible-drug-war-killings-international-criminal-court/,['JODESZ GAVILAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Lawyers and families of victims on Friday, January 27, urged state forces and officials to come out and testify against the top minds involved in the bloody anti-illegal drug campaign under then-president Rodrigo Duterte. National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) and Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a group composed of families left behind, released this call as the International Criminal Court (ICC) pre-trial chamber resumes the investigation into the drug war killings. “Apela namin na lumantad ang mga pulis, ahente, asset, o tao na alam ang sistema at pagkakawing-kawing ng mga direktiba, at tumestigo laban sa mga ultimong salarin,” lawyers Neri Colmenares and Kristina Conti said on behalf of the two groups. “Nakabantay kami sa mga ‘ika nga ay ‘gawalang guilty’ – pagsisinungaling, panlilihis, pagtuturuan, pagsisihan, pagwasak ng ebidensiya, pananakot ng biktima at saksi,” they said. (We appeal to cops, agents, assets, or anyone who knows the drug war system and directives to testify against those most responsible. We will be vigilante against moves by the guilty, including lying, deceiving, blaming, destroying of evidence, or even harassing of victims and witnesses.) The pre-trial chamber on Thursday evening Dutch time, January 26, announced that it was “not satisfied that the Philippines is undertaking relevant investigations that would warrant a deferral of the Court’s investigations on the basis of the complementarity principle.” This move means that the office of ICC prosecutor Karim Khan can continue his investigation. He is also expected to seek more evidence that could potentially request for the issuance of summons or warrants to those involved in the drug war. It is not clear who will be the subject of possible summons or warrants, but the ICC is usually interested in high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, the investigation will also cover the killings in Davao City that occurred from 2011 to 2016, when Duterte was mayor and then vice mayor, and his daugher, now-Vice President Sara Duterte, was mayor. The most high-profile insider that came out and gave firsthand information on Duterte’s involvement in killings is former Davao City policeman Arturo Lascañas, whom the ICC has granted limited immunity. NUPL and Rise UP called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to cooperate with the investigation, and to initiate the process of the Philippines’ return to the ICC as a member-state. Duterte unilaterally withdrew the country from ICC in 2018. “Bagaman may kaba at takot dahil sa patuloy na kawalang pananagutan ng mga akusada, makikipagtulungan kami sa ICC dahil ito ang pinakapatas na pagkakataon para makakuha ng hustisya ang mga biktima,” the groups said. “Mas mainam din na maging aktibong kalahok tayong lahat,” they added. (Despite fear because of the continued culture of impunity among the accused, we shall be cooperating with the ICC because it is the right time for families of victims to get justice. It is important that everyone engages with the proceedings.) Official government data shows that at least 6,252 people have died at the hands of the police during anti-illegal drug operations as of May 31, 2022, a month before Duterte left office in June. This tally does not include victims of vigilante-style killings, which human rights groups estimate to pull the number up to around 30,000. Documents obtained by Rappler show that the Philippine National Police (PNP) already recorded 7,884 deaths between July 1, 2016 and August 31, 2020. Families continue to face challenges in seeking justice for their loved ones slain in the violent war on drugs, including being denied access to the most basic documents from the police. They see the ICC as their only hope for justice. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/ltfrb-says-libreng-sakay-likely-be-replaced-discounted-rides/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Free rides likely won’t be coming back, but commuters may still find relief through discounted fares, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Friday, January 27. The LTFRB said that the Libreng Sakay program, which offered free rides for EDSA Carousel buses, does not have enough budget to be totally free. Instead, the LTFRB and Department of Transportation (DOTr) are planning to offer discounted fares for several modes of public transportation. “The intention of the leadership is to stretch the money for as long as we can. And we include jeepneys, shuttle rides. Hindi lang ho buses. So malamang ang gagawin dito (It won’t just be for buses. So most likely, what will happen here is that) we will just be giving discounts,” said LTFRB Chairman Teofilo Guadiz III in a press conference on Friday, January 27. Although the specifics of the revamped program is still being discussed, Guadiz said that the subsidies will continue to benefit both passengers and drivers of public utility vehicles (PUVs). “It is a subsidy. Probably on a per person basis, and of course we still have the subsidy din para sa mga drivers sa mga gasolina po (for drivers for their gasoline), which is P1,000,” Guadiz clarified. Under the 2023 budget, the PUV service contracting program is set to receive P2.16 billion in funding, with P1.285 billion in programmed appropriations and P875 million in unprogrammed appropriations. The LTFRB chairman said that this amount would quickly run out if the Libreng Sakay program for the EDSA Carousel – which offered 24/7 free rides in December 2022 – were to resume, echoing the sentiment of Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista last December. “Amin po namin na kung ang pinagiisipan po natin is totally libre na sakay, hindi po kakayanin. In fact ‘pag ginamit mo lang ‘yan sa EDSA, doon sa carousel nila (If we’re talking about resuming totally free rides, we’re not capable of doing that. In fact, if we use that for the EDSA Carousel), that would only be good for three or four months,” Guadiz said. Guadiz also added that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is about to turn over the P1.285 billion budget to the LTFRB. However, the agency is still awaiting instruction from the DOTr on how to mobilize the money. Senator Sonny Angara, who serves as chairman of the Senate finance committee, had earlier pushed for the continuation of the Libreng Sakay program since the budget provided was a “substantial amount.” “Malaking bagay ang pagpapatuloy ng Libreng Sakay sa panahon na ito lalo na at mabigat pa din ang pasanin ng karamihan ng ating mga kababayan dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng mga bilihin,” the senator had said. (The continuation of Libreng Sakay is a big help at this time, especially now that most of us are burdened by the continued rise of prices of goods.) – Rappler.com"

Instead, VAT-registered taxpayers need only file quarterly VAT returns (BIR Form No. 2550Q). Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 5-2023 provides for the transitory provisions for the implementation of the Quarterly Filing of VAT returns starting January 1, 2023. Transitory provisions are hereby provided: For taxpayers with the quarter ending January 31, 2023, the deadline of filing the BIR form 2550Q shall not be later than February 27, 2023 since the 25th day falls on Saturday. However, they are still required to file for BIR form 2550M for the transactions covering December 2022 on or before January 20, 2023.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/chances-to-locate-missing-cessna-plane-now-higher-due-to-smaller-search-area/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Although it’s hard to tell if the missing Cessna plane in Isabela will be located on Friday, January 27, the Isabela local government said the chances are now higher due to the narrowed-down search area. “Mahirap pong sabihin. Unang-una, ‘yon pong weather. Pero tumaas, tumaas ‘yong chance na mahanap today because ang liit na lang ngayon ng search area and puwede pang ma-pinpoint. Pero ang problema po talaga natin ay si weather,” Constante Foronda, head of Isabela’s Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO), said in a press conference on Friday. (It’s hard to tell. First, the bad weather. But the chance of locating the plane today is higher because the search area has been narrowed down and can be pinpointed. But our main problem is the weather.) Foronda was responding to a question on whether the missing plane will be located within the day. The Isabela Incident Management Team had narrowed down the search area to Divilacan town, after they received information that a farmer saw a distressed plane flying towards Maconacon airport. The area is within Barangay Dicaruyan in Divilacan – only 10 kilometers from the cell site of the town of Maconacon. Earlier, the authorities said a cellphone of one of the passengers was able to register within the cell site’s radius. The Cessna plane, with tail number RP-C1174 and six people on board, has been missing since January 24 after it took off from the Cauayan Domestic Airport in Isabela province. The plane was supposed to arrive at 3 pm on the same day in Maconacon town. Foronda added that authorities have yet to deploy a drone in the area because of bad weather. The official added they cannot say if there is a “high” probability that the passengers survived until they see signs of life, but added that they are hopeful. “In fact, we’re so optimistic. Nakakarga po sa chopper ay mga pagkain na ihuhulog doon sa site, puwedeng kainin no’ng mga survivors (The chopper contains food that will be dropped at the site for the survivors). That’s how optimistic we are,” Foronda said. The Isabela PDRRMO head said they also set up a triage in their command center to immediately attend to the survivors’ medical needs in case they are rescued. The operation remains at search and rescue level, as of Friday. Foronda also responded to criticisms that authorities are not doing enough. The Isabela official said it’s hard to operate because of the area’s topography. “Akala siguro nila patag ‘yan na madali mong galugarin. Hindi nila alam na bulubundukin ‘yan, matataas na bundok, magkakatabi. Magkamali ka lang eh puwede kayong sumemplang doon sa tagiliran ng bundok o mahalikan ng helicopter ‘yong bundok,” he explained. (They think it’s easy to search because they think the area is flat. They don’t know it’s actually a mountain range, tall mountains standing together. When you make a mistake, you can fall at the side of the mountain, or the helicopter will crash in the mountain.) Planes have an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) that can be used to identify the location of an aircraft in case of an emergency. During the briefing, Foronda and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines explained that an ELT is a device attached to a plane. In case of collision or plane crash, the device will notify the system and will activate the plane’s location. But, according to Foronda, they have yet to receive information through the Cessna plane’s ELT. He added there could be a lot of factors as to why the ELT system has yet to provide information about the plane. “Hanggang ngayon, wala. Dapat tumawag na ‘yong nasa Singapore, I understand. Ang tatawag ‘yong Singapore doon sa may-ari na sasabihin, ‘na-activate ‘yong ELT ninyo at sasabihin nila nandito ‘yong location,’ wala. Kung mayroon sana, mabilis nating nahanap ‘yan,” the official said. (Until now, there’s none. I understand, the representatives of the ELT’s system from Singapore should have called by now. Singapore will call the plane’s owner and will say, ‘Your ELT has been activated and here’s the location,’ but there’s none. If we already received the information, it would be easier to search.) – Rappler.com"

https://factsfirstph-partners.rappler.com/6065/fact-check-video-claims-sara-duterte-scrap-k-12-curriculum/,[],"CLAIM: In a video with the headline “KAKAPASOK LANG HALA KA! SEN RAFFY TULFO UMAKSYON NA K-12 PROGRAM ni PNOY TANG-GAL NA VPSARA PBBM.!” YouTube channel Banat News TV released January 18 claims that Senator Raffy Tulfo supports the alleged decision of Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte to remove the K-12 curriculum and replace it with a two-year mandatory military service program. As of writing, the video has more than 60,000 views and almost 2,000 likes. Why it is false While Sara Duterte has previously expressed that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. instructed her to review the implementation of K-12, she has not explicitly stated her desire to scrap it. In fact, she said in an interview that the abolition of K-12 cannot be decided overnight. DepEd is still reviewing the K-12 curriculum and is set to release their updates on January 30. There may be revisions in the said curriculum, but DepEd did not mention anything about its abolition. Additionally, the implementation of the K-12 curriculum is mandated by Republic Act No. 10533 or the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013. Being a law, its repeal is within the powers of the legislative branch and not the Department of Education. In 2018, DepEd already released a statement that it could not arbitrarily discontinue the K-12 program. The concerned video also featured Sen. Tulfo suggesting that he supports Sara Duterte’s plan to scrap K-12. The statements featured were not recent but were made by Sen. Tulfo on June 24, 2022, on his Raffy Tulfo in Action YouTube channel. The said statements were in response to the news that Sara Duterte would look into the implementation of K-12.

Dorian Finney-Smith had 18 points and 12 rebounds, Dwight Powell added 15 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 11, and Reggie Bullock had 10 for Dallas, which snapped the Suns’ four-game winning streak. Doncic, who entered the night as the NBA’s leading scorer at 33.8 points per game, exited early in the first quarter due to a sprained left ankle and did not return. X-rays were negative. Chris Paul and Cameron Johnson led Phoenix with 22 points apiece, while Deandre Ayton had 19 points and 20 rebounds after missing the last three games due to a non-COVID illness. Mikal Bridges scored 16 points and Paul tallied 10 assists. Phoenix trailed by 9 with 3:34 remaining before cutting the deficit to 96-95 on Paul’s layup with 19.7 seconds remaining. Bullock then made the first of two foul shots before missing the second attempt. Powell was fouled while grabbing the rebound and knocked down two free throws to secure the victory. Dinwiddie helped the Mavericks win for just the third time in 10 games while shooting 5-of-6 from three-point range and 11-of-14 from the foul line.

Phoenix trailed by two late in the second period before Dallas scored 9 of the final 14 points to take a 54-48 lead into the half. The Mavericks maintained their lead throughout the third quarter thanks in large part to Dinwiddie, who scored 10 points for the third straight period. Dallas held a seven-point advantage to start the fourth quarter and stretched its lead to 89-81 on Finney-Smith’s trey with 6:55 remaining.

Brunson added 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 blocks, rejecting Malcolm Brogdon’s potential game-tying three at the buzzer.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/us-fbi-infiltration-hive-ransomware-gang-helping-300-victims/,[],"The FBI on Thursday, January 26, revealed it had secretly hacked and disrupted a prolific ransomware gang called Hive, a maneuver that allowed the bureau to thwart the group from collecting more than $130 million in ransomware demands from more than 300 victims. At a news conference, US Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco said government hackers broke into Hive’s network and put the gang under surveillance, surreptitiously stealing the digital keys the group used to unlock victim organizations’ data. They were then able to alert victims in advance so they could take steps to protect their systems before Hive demanded the payments. “Using lawful means, we hacked the hackers,” Monaco told reporters. “We turned the tables on Hive.” News of the takedown first leaked on Thursday morning when Hive’s website was replaced with a flashing message that said: “The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of coordinated law enforcement action taken against Hive Ransomware.” Hive’s servers were also seized by the German Federal Criminal Police and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit. “Intensive cooperation across national borders and continents, characterized by mutual trust, is the key to fighting serious cybercrime effectively,” said German police commissioner Udo Vogel in a statement from police and prosecutors in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, who assisted in the probe. Reuters was not immediately able to locate contact details for Hive. It is unclear where they were geographically based. The takedown of Hive is distinct from some of the other high-profile ransomware cases the US Justice Department has announced in recent years, such as a cyber attack in 2021 against the Colonial Pipeline Co. In that case, the Justice Department seized some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom after the company had already paid the hackers. Here, there were no seizures because investigators intervened before Hive demanded the payments. The undercover infiltration, which started in July 2022, went undetected by the gang until now. Hive was one the most prolific among a wide range of cybercriminal groups that extort international businesses by encrypting their data and demanding massive cryptocurrency payments in return. The Justice Department said that over the years, Hive has targeted more than 1,500 victims in 80 different countries, and has collected more than $100 million in ransomware payments. Although there were no arrests announced on Wednesday, Garland said the investigation was ongoing and one department official told reporters to “stay tuned.” Garland said the FBI’s operation helped a wide range of victims, including a Texas school district. “The bureau provided decryption keys to the school district, saving it from making a $5 million ransom payment,” he said. A Louisiana hospital, meanwhile, was spared $3 million. Hive was a ransomware-as-a-service organization (sometimes abbreviated RaaS) which means that it farmed out aspects of its hacking spree to affiliates in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. Canadian researcher Brett Callow, of cybersecurity company Emsisoft, said in an email it was “one of the most active groups around, if not the most active.” International law enforcement has struggled for years to beat the hydra-like scourge of ransomware, which has periodically crippled companies, government bodies and – increasingly – critical infrastructure. Short of any arrests, Hive’s hackers will likely soon “either set up shop under a different brand or get recruited into other RaaS groups,” said Jim Simpson, director of threat intelligence at British firm Searchlight Cyber. Simpson still welcomed the move, saying that “either way, the operation has imposed a significant cost on Hive’s activities.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/zamboanga-del-norte-dipolog-tension-donation-dispute/,[],"DIPOLOG CITY, Philippines – The Zamboanga del Norte provincial government and the Dipolog city government are on the brink of a legal showdown as the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged irregularities in the provincial capitol’s donation of vehicles, equipment, and pieces of land to city hall and other local governments in the province during the administration of former governor Roberto Uy. The mass donations, made with authority from the previous Zamboanga del Norte provincial board immediately before a change in administration in June last year, were widely seen as sabotage, and a political statement against the election victory of Governor Rosalina Jalosjos, Uy’s political foe. On January 19, COA released an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), signed by COA team leader Jonathan Manuel and supervising auditor Jeanette Calamohoy, stating that the donations “were not in accordance with pertinent provisions on the Rules and Regulations on Supply and Property Management in the Local Governments.” he COA recommended that the provincial capitol “institute legal actions to recover the donated vehicles, equipment, and lands.” Of the 67 provincial board resolutions for donation to other local governments, 40 have deeds of donation covering 26 donees, while 27 were without deeds of donation, the state auditors noted. The donations included at least 116 vehicles, equipment, and parcels of land. The COA stated that the modality used for the mass donations can be seen, based on Rule 21, Section 166-b of COA Circular 92-386, as “transfer without cost which is dependent only on the two established criteria: 1. Become unserviceable, and 2. No longer needed.” However, the COA said that all of the donations were “serviceable, mostly in its best condition, being newly procured, currently in use, and with values,” making the acts “invalid.” City hall, however, was defiant on Thursday, January 26, and hung tarpaulins at the old provincial hospital compound with the message: “Unauthorized persons keep out: Property of the City Government of Dipolog.” The property, one of the donations of the Uy administration to the Dipolog City government, currently houses a storage facility for COVID-19 vaccines and offices being used by the following: On October 19, 2022, Dipolog Mayor Darel Dexter Uy, the former governor’s son, wrote to the offices to inform them that city hall had already acquired the lot through a deed of donation. The tension between the capitol and city hall is nearing boiling point, with both sides taking drastic measures to assert their claim over the disputed property. The provincial government, armed with the COA recommendations to recover the disputed donations, has deployed militias to secure the compound. Meanwhile, the city government, determined to hold on to the property it claims to have acquired through a lawful deed of donation, has also sent its own militias to protect its interests. With both sides refusing to back down, observers said the stage is set for a high-stakes legal battle that could have far-reaching consequences for local politics and the future of the province. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/fiji-suspends-police-commissioner-scraps-china-policing-arrangement/,[],"Fiji’s president on Friday, January 27, suspended the commissioner of police after a general election saw the first change in government in the Pacific island nation in 16 years, after the military earlier warned against “sweeping changes.” President Ratu Wiliame Katonivere said Commissioner of Police Sitiveni Qiliho had been suspended on the advice of the Constitutional Offices Commission, “pending investigation and referral to and appointment of, a tribunal.” The Supervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem was also suspended by the commission, the statement said. Qiliho declined to comment to local media because he said he will face a tribunal over his conduct. He was seen as being close to former prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who led Fiji for 16 years before a coalition of parties narrowly won December’s election and installed Sitiveni Rabuka as leader of the strategically important Pacific nation. The day before a coalition agreement was struck, Qiliho and Bainimarama called on the military to maintain law and order because they said the hung election result had sparked ethnic tensions, a claim disputed by the coalition parties. The Pacific island nation, which has a history of military coups, has been pivotal to the region’s response to competition between China and the United States, and struck a deal with Australia in October for greater defense cooperation. On Thursday, Fiji Times reported Rabuka said his government would end a police training and exchange agreement with China. “Our system of democracy and justice systems are different so we will go back to those that have similar systems with us,” the prime minister was quoted as saying, referring to Australia and New Zealand. The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Republic of Fiji Military Forces Commander Major General Jone Kalouniwai earlier this month warned Rabuka’s government against making “sweeping changes”, and has insisted it abide by a 2013 constitution which gives the military a key role. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/oscar-contenders-court-box-office-bounce-drama-audiences-dwindle/,[],"LOS ANGELES, USA – More movie theaters this weekend will be showing The Fablemans, Tar, and Women Talking, a move to capitalize on the films’ Oscar nominations at a time when dramas are struggling to draw people to cinemas. After moviegoing plunged during the pandemic, audiences have returned in droves to action-packed blockbusters such as Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water. The Avatar sequel has raked in more than $2 billion, ranking as the sixth-highest grossing film of all time. Many of the Hollywood dramas targeted at adult viewers have not fared nearly as well. Some older moviegoers simply have not returned to the local megaplex, industry executives told Reuters. Others have decided to wait to stream movies that do not have a visual spectacle that pops off a big screen. Studios are now making movies available to watch at home as soon as 17 days after their theatrical debut. But filmmakers hope the publicity leading up to the Oscars in March will lure some moviegoers back to their neighborhood cinema. Box office receipts can rise as much as 75% in the weeks following a Best Picture nomination, according to Comscore data. Best Picture nominee Women Talking, about a religious colony grappling with a series of rapes, will expand from 153 theaters to more than 700 this weekend, according to a person familiar with the film’s rollout. Its ticket sales so far total less than $1.3 million. The distributor, United Artists Releasing, planned the release strategy to coincide with this week’s Oscar nominations, with the hope the movie would benefit from a box-office bounce. The move was a gamble, the person said, since nominations are never guaranteed. Tar, a Best Picture contender starring Cate Blanchett as a manipulative orchestra conductor, will expand to 535 theaters from 100. The movie has collected about $7.2 million at global cinemas to date. Even legendary director Steven Spielberg has had trouble drawing crowds to Best Picture nominee The Fabelmans, his autobiographical story about family strife and anti-Semitism he faced as a teenager. Since its release in November, the film has brought in $21.8 million worldwide. The Fabelmans will play in 1,800 cinemas this weekend, nearly double the number from a week ago, according to a source familiar with the plans. Spielberg told Reuters earlier this month that he was concerned about the dwindling turnout for adult dramas. “But there’s been some bright spots this year, some very, very bright spots where films for older people are actually getting older people out to see those films in motion picture theaters,” he said. “So I’m kind of optimistic about it.” One drama that has bucked the trend is Sony Corp’s A Man Called Otto starring Tom Hanks as a grumpy older man grieving the loss of his wife. The film has pulled in more than $57 million at theaters since its late December debut. Best Picture nominee Elvis became a hit last summer by aiming to entertain viewers of all ages, incorporating music from contemporary artists such as Doja Cat and Diplo alongside the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s classic recordings. “We held very passionately the idea that we had to get volumes of young and old back into the theaters,” director Baz Luhrmann said in an interview. Elvis has collected $287.3 million at theaters. Warner Bros is re-releasing the film in movie houses this weekend after it landed eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor. Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures made Tar and The Fabelmans available to rent at home via premium video-on-demand even as they continued to play in theaters. The company has not disclosed revenue from those sales, though its executives have credited this strategy with lifting some films into profitability. Sarah Polley, the director of Women Talking, said that as a moviegoer she enjoys seeing “smaller, more intimate human dramas” in theaters. “I really love the feeling of sensing an audience, and sensing someone’s breath or emotion, or the beginning of a laugh, or crying,” she said in an interview this month. “Not being able to be attuned to the others in a room is something that would make me sad if that started to disappear,” she said. “It’s not looking great at the moment.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-27-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Ukraine on Friday, January 27, battled Russian troops trying to pierce its lines in the east and northeast before Kyiv takes delivery of tanks from its Western allies, saying the fighting showed it needed more weapons to repel the invaders. Kyiv said fierce battles were under way, a day after at least 11 people were killed in missile and drone strikes which were widely seen in Ukraine as a response to the promises by important allies to send it tanks. After weeks of wrangling, Germany and the United States this week said they would send Ukraine dozens of modern tanks to help push back Russian forces, opening the way for others to follow suit. Poland gave Ukraine a further boost on Friday by promising an additional 60 tanks on top of 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it had already pledged. Both sides in the war are widely expected to launch spring offensives though Washington has advised Ukraine against doing so until the latest weapons are in place and training has been provided – a process expected to take several months. Russia said the United States was “pumping weapons into Ukraine,” which Moscow says does Washington’s bidding, and chided President Joe Biden, saying he held the key to ending the conflict but had not used it. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked allies for their support but renewed calls for tougher sanctions on Moscow and more weapons in the twelfth month of the war. “This evil, this Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly television address on Thursday. Hours after he spoke, Ukrainian officials reported fierce battles in the northeast and east of the country, scene of some of the heaviest combat since Russia’s invasion on February 24 last year. “Fierce fighting continues along the front lines,” said Oleh Synehubov, governor of the northeastern region of Kharkiv, adding that Ukrainian forces were holding out. Millions of Ukrainians faced electricity shortages after Thursday’s missile and drone strikes, the latest to target energy facilities and deprive people of heat, light and water. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of targeting civilian infrastructure, a charge that Moscow denies. Russia said the strikes focused on “facilities that operate Ukraine’s defense industrial complex and transport system,” and limited Ukraine’s ability to repair military hardware and transport arms provided by its allies. “The goals of the massive attack have been reached. All the assigned targets have been neutralized,” it said. Reuters could not verify the battlefield reports. Front lines have been largely frozen for two months, with Russia trying to gain ground in the east after occupying swathes of territory there and protect a corridor of land it has seized in southern Ukraine. Oleskandr Musiyenko, head of the Military and Strategic Research Centre of Ukraine, said Russia was sending in more reinforcements, mainly conscripts, to block Ukrainian advances. “But they do not have the level of artillery and tank support they had on February 24,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian television. Britain said in an intelligence update that Russian forces had probably conducted probing attacks near Orikhiv in southeastern Ukraine and in Vuhledar in the east, but were unlikely to have achieved “substantive advances.” Kyiv also accuses Moscow of deporting children as well as adults from occupied areas and giving them Russian passports. Filippo Grandi, the UN’s refugee agency chief, said this violated “the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war” and that Russia must stop it. Japan tightened sanctions on Friday, expanding an export ban list and freezing assets of Russian officials and entities. But Ukraine’s hopes that the European Union will impose sanctions affecting nuclear energy were dealt a blow by Hungary, which said that it would veto such moves. Hungary has a Russian-built nuclear plant which it plans to expand. Russia tightened its own moves against Western entities, with communications regulator Roskomnadzor saying it had blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Eritrea on the last stop of a tour of Africa that was intended to shore up support and began in South Africa, which plans joint military drills with Russia and China. Ending her own tour of African nations, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she had discussed economic sanctions on Russia during every stop and hoped an agreement could be reached soon on the next cap on the price of Russian oil. Kyiv and its allies say Russia’s oil profits can be used to fund Moscow’s war effort. Russia has shifted the focus of its rhetoric from “denazifying” and “demilitarising” Ukraine to confronting what is says is an aggressive and expansionist US-led NATO alliance. Ukraine and the West say the invasion was an unprovoked act of aggression. – Rappler.com"

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it would look at more than 100 influencers after several consumers informed the regulator about some endorsements and testimonials which they said were misleading. “The number of tip-offs reflects the community concern about the ever-increasing number of manipulative marketing techniques on social media, designed to exploit or pressure consumers into purchasing goods or services,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement. As part of the sweep, ACCC has begun reviewing Meta Platforms Inc’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc’s Snapchat, Alphabet Inc’s YouTube and Amazon.com Inc’s streaming service Twitch, Cass-Gottlieb said. The probe will target influencers in fashion, cosmetics, food and beverage, travel, fitness, parenting, gaming and technology.

https://www.rappler.com/business/philippines-gets-loans-asian-development-bank-january-2023/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $500-million (P27.2 billion) loan for the Philippines’ programs to boost job creation in pandemic-hit sectors, and another $500-million loan for agricultural reform. Under the ADB’s Post-COVID-19 Business and Employment Recovery Program, the multilateral lender supports the government’s jobs and business recovery blueprint. It also supports the private sector-led SkillsUpNet Philippines, which provides grants to enterprises for upskilling workers in information technology, construction, agribusiness, and tourism. While the unemployment rate declined to 4.2% in November 2022 from 6.5% a year earlier, recovery remains uneven. The ADB noted that wage employment in private establishments remains lower than pre-pandemic levels. Similarly, informal employment remains higher, even though it has declined in recent months. “With the economy slowly moving towards a sustainable growth path, it is important to ensure private enterprises are supported with policies that make it easier for them to do business and generate employment,” said ADB Senior Public Management Economist Sameer Khatiwada. Meanwhile, the $500 million for agricultural reform is under the ADB’s Competitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program, which seeks to further develop the agriculture sector with trade policy and regulatory framework reforms. “This new loan aims to support the Philippines’ efforts to attain food security by building a competitive and inclusive agriculture sector that is characterized by improved efficiency, enhanced diversity, strengthened climate resilience, and higher farm incomes,” said ADB Principal Natural Resources and Agriculture Economist for Southeast Asia Takeshi Ueda. From 2020 to 2022, the ADB committed $8.9 billion for the Philippines’ recovery efforts. The loans in 2023 bring the total commitments by the multilateral institution during the pandemic to $9.9 billion. In 2020, the ADB committed 11 loan deals worth $4 billion. In 2021, there were six commitments worth $2.23 billion. In 2022, there were four loan agreements worth $2.5 billion. – Rappler.com $1 = P54.40"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/jack-animam-signs-french-basketball-club-toulouse-metropole-basket/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Jack Animam, the country’s top female basketball player, will finally make her long-awaited comeback from a knee injury that sidelined her for a year. Animam’s return, though, will not be in the local basketball scene. Instead, she is taking her talents to one of the elite women’s professional basketball leagues in Europe, the Ligue Féminine de Basketball (LFB), after she was signed by the French ballclub Toulouse Metropole Basket, the national team star confirmed on Friday, January 27. The LFB or the Women’s Basketball League is the premier division of the women’s professional basketball league in France. Animam hopes to make it in time for Toulouse’s game on Sunday, January 29, against Flammes Carolo. Toulouse is currently 11th in the standings in the 12-team LFB. Her entry might just be the shot in the arm the squad needs this season where they have struggled with just two wins against eight losses. “To be honest I don’t know what to feel. Halo-halong emosyon (mixed emotions). I’m nervous, anxious but I’m just so excited,” Animam told Rappler. “This is what I’ve been working for a year and a month now. As I said, all I need is an opportunity. And this is it! This is the cultivation of my hard work and sacrifices all throughout my rehab journey. And right now I’m already very thankful to my new team for taking a chance on me. I can’t wait to play with and for them.” The 6-foot-3 Animam has proven that at her best, she can dominate even against foreign competition. In 2020, she led the Shin Hsin University to an 18-0 record en route to winning Taiwan’s University Basketball Association (UBA). In 2021, Animam made history by becoming the first Philippine-born player to be signed by a European professional basketball club when she joined Radnicki Kragujevac in the First Women’s Basketball League of Serbia. The former National University standout was a double-double machine for Radnicki and posted averages of 20 points, 14.3 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game. Her stint with Radnicki, unfortunately, was cut short after seven games when she suffered a season-ending knee injury. Toulouse has a number of solid players that Animam will be teaming up with like Kalis Lloyd, the six-foot forward and member of Sweden’s national team who leads the French squad in scoring at 15.6 points per outing; and starting point guard Kyra Lambert, an American who was a former captain of Duke University in the US NCAA and norms 9 points and 5 assists. Veteran guard Isabelle Strunc, who has played in the Women’s National Basketball League in Australia, power forward Noemie Brochant, and 6-foot-4 starting center Aminata Gueye are also averaging in double figures for Toulouse. Strunc, Brochant, and Gueye have all played for the French national under-20 team. Animam will be expected to shore up the Toulouse frontline and help out Gueye and Brochant. Former WNBA center, 6-foot-3 Megan Huff, has put up underwhelming numbers for Toulouse with her averages of just 6.3 points and 3 rebounds. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/sandiganbayan-affirms-graft-conviction-roderick-paulate/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has affirmed the graft conviction of former Quezon City councilor Roderick Paulate over the hiring of ghost employees in 2010. In a 26-page resolution dated January 23, 2023, the Sandiganbayan 7th Division denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Paulate and his staff, Vicente Bajamunde, in relation to their November 25, 2022 conviction. “We deny the motion for lack of merit. After a careful perusal of the arguments raised by accused, the court finds no cogent reason to disturb its earlier findings,” the court said. The court affirmed their conviction on one count of graft punishable by six to eight years imprisonment, and as well as Paulate’s guilty verdict on nine counts of falsification of public documents, which carries a prison term of six months to six years and a fine of P10,000 for each count. The defendants had argued that the court erred in requiring the defense to prove that the contractual employees in question were real persons. Paulate also claimed that the prosecution failed to prove that he had prior knowledge that the job contractors under his office payroll were fictitious. The court, however, stood by its November 25, 2022 decision, noting that the former councilor failed to submit evidence to back his argument that the 30 names in the payroll were real employees. “It bears to note that those names/people were recommended by accused to be hired, he certified that they performed work for 40 hours per week, he signed their payroll, and denied that they are ghost employees,” the anti-graft court said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/eastern-visayas-pnp-probing-cops-links-narcotics/,[],"LEYTE, Philippines-  Some cops in Eastern Visayas are under investigation for alleged involvement in illegal drug trade. PNP Eastern Visayas spokesperson Police Colonel Bella Rentuaya told Rappler on Thursday, January 26, that “the investigation on them is continuing and they are now assigned at the PNP Regional Office” in Palo, Leyte. Rentuaya did not mention how many cops were under probe but said they have ranks below full colonel. On January 19, Eastern Visayas police chief Brigadier General Rommel Francisco Marbil relieved Catbalogan City OIC police chief Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Cuntapay and six of his subordinates – Senior Master Sergeant Dennis Figueroa Padayao, senior staff sergeants Hermar Abotog, and Macario Rosal Fulgencio Jr., and corporals Harrison Duranggo Cinco, Steven Michael Tamayo Dadulla, and Igie Boy Saldino Rabuya. Marbil reassigned all seven cops to the regional office in Palo, Leyte, and appointed Leyte Provincial police intelligence unit chief Lieutenant Colonel Dinvir Revita to replace Cuntapay. “I don’t have any personal knowledge or information why they were relieved,  but since there was an order from the PNP Director, it’s valid and legal,” Rentuaya told Rappler. Rappler is trying to reach Cuntapay and will update with new developments as soon as he responds. The Eastern Visayas police spokesperson said the office frequently rotates cops to prevent corruption. “Usually narerelieve ang isang police ‘pag lampas na ito sa time niya sa post (cop are relieved if they overstays in a post), or if you are involved in something. So that you won’t have the power to maneuver, you are relieved while the investigation is underway,” she said in a mix of English and Filipino. “Every day, we closely monitor our personnel,” Rentuaya added. “The PNP is trying to clean the house and we want to send a message that nobody is immune.” Twenty-one key PNP Easter Visayas officials, including two brigadier generals and 19 colonels, have followed the January 4 directive of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to submit their courtesy resignation Abalos’ order is part of efforts to purge the PNP of cops with drug links.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/dela-rosa-response-icc-probe-warrants-stage/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief of Rodrigo Duterte, said he is ready for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) probe into alleged killings under Duterte. “‘Yong sabi ko nga, fear of the unknown dahil ibang animal itong [ICC] sila, ibang entity. Hindi natin alam kung ano sila and ano ‘yong motive behind nila, bakit sila insisting. ‘Yan ‘yong sabi ko noon, na medyo may fear of the unknown ako,” the senator told Karen Davila in an ANC interview on Friday, January 27. (What I said was, fear of the unknown because the ICC is a different animal, different entity. We do not know who they are and what their motives are, why they are insisting. That’s what I’ve said before, that I have fear of the unknown.) “But now, I have no more fears. You can go ahead whatever you want, I’m ready. Whatever happens, my life, my future is dependent on the decision of this government,” the police-chief-turned-lawmaker added. Dela Rosa responded to the question of whether he still has fears about the probe. The senator’s remarks also came shortly after the ICC moved its investigation to the warrants stage. This means the ICC’s pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the probe because it was not satisfied with the Philippine government’s intervention in the alleged killings. Although the ICC did not cite particular officials in its latest information, Dela Rosa was earlier named in a report by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in 2021. The senator played a big role in the drug war that took the lives of thousands of people because he was the Duterte administration’s first PNP chief – Dela Rosa was the first one to implement the bloody war. From July 2016 to October 2018, which mostly covered Dela Rosa’s time as PNP chief, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency said at least 4,999 have died. Before he became the PNP chief, Dela Rosa also served as Davao City police chief when Duterte was still the mayor of Davao. The Davao Death Squad (DDS) flourished under Duterte and was known to carry out kill orders from higher-ups that allegedly included the former Davao City mayor. In his affidavit submitted to the ICC, former cop, DDS member and whistleblower Arturo Lascañas also implicated Dela Rosa and named his as among public officials who were “enablers” of Duterte. Edgar Matobato, a former DDS member, likewise implicated Dela Rosa and said the former Davao City police chief was aware of the DDS’ activities. Dela Rosa said he will cooperate in the ICC probe as long as the government, currently headed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., will cooperate. Marcos is a staunch ally of Duterte and he earlier said that under his administration, the country has no plans of rejoining the ICC. “As I have said, if the Philippine government would cooperate, then I am a part of the Philippine government so I will cooperate. No problem with me, if the Philippine government cooperates,” Dela Rosa said. When asked by Rappler if he had already spoken to Duterte following the most recent ICC developments, the senator reiterated that his actions will be based on the Marcos administration’s decisions. “Not yet. My future actions are dependent on the actions of this government since it is very consistent on its denial from ICC to proceed with their investigation in our jurisdiction,” Dela Rosa told Rappler. The senator said he has no reaction to the ICC’s latest move, but added it is now up to the Marcos administration if the ICC will be allowed entry to the country. Allowing entry and providing evidence to the ICC will depend on the Philippine government’s decision, he added. Dela Rosa did not directly answer the question about what he will do, if in a hypothetical situation, the ICC issued a warrant against him. When asked if he would still be comfortable about traveling overseas, he replied: “Ngayon nga hindi na ‘ko nagta-travel abroad. Eh ‘yan pa, kung may warrant ako. Eh siguro ano, huhulihin nila ‘ko do’n pagdating sa airport outside ng Philippine jurisdiction (As early as now, I have not been traveling abroad. What more now if I have a warrant. Probably, they might arrest me once I arrive in an airport outside of the Philippine jurisdiction).” – with reports from Bea Cupin/Rappler.com"

Lula, who was elected for a third term last October vowing to tackle deforestation in the rainforest, discussed in a phone call with Macron efforts to combat the threat posed by climate change, according to a statement from his office. He talked about the importance of France attending a summit of the countries of the Amazon forest that Brazil plans to host in the next few month, as it is the only European country to share the biome, through its overseas territory of French Guiana. Besides Brazil and French Guiana, seven other countries have territory in the world’s largest rainforest. Macron has meanwhile asked Brazil to attend its own “One Forest Summit” that France and Gabon will host in early March, according to the Brazilian statement. Lula won a narrow election last year promising an overhaul in Brazil’s climate policy, after deforestation in the Amazon reached its highest levels in 15 years under then far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who undermined environmental law enforcement and pushed for more mining and farming in the region. Bolsonaro had a strained relationship with Macron, after the French president denounced in 2019 surging fires in the Amazon. Bolsonaro responded by insulting Macron’s wife and accusing him of disrespecting Brazilian sovereignty. Later on Thursday, Macron said after speaking with Lula that he had reaffirmed his determination to take action “for the climate, biodiversity, our forests and against hunger.” “We will meet these challenges,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/lawmaker-wants-house-look-automating-barangay-elections/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – A ranking House member urged the lower chamber’s suffrage panel to study whether the Commission on Elections (Comelec) could automate the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections scheduled in October. In a statement, Cavite Representative Elpidio Barzaga Jr., vice chairperson of the suffrage committee, said an experimental use of the automated election system (AES) for the nationwide vote later in the year could result in the faster proclamation of winners and fewer errors in the reading of ballots. Currently, the October polls will be manual, from the casting of ballots to the canvassing of votes. “Automated elections have proven to be economical as it can accommodate up to more than 1,000 voters per clustered precinct as opposed to the 500 voters per precinct in manual elections which entails hiring more personnel in manual elections,” he said in a resolution filed on Wednesday, January 25. The Comelec, in response, said it will look into the proposal, but maintained that a full automation of the electoral exercise set in the third quarter is likely off the table. “We will study if we can at least pilot test in certain areas or precincts the automation of the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections,” Comelec Chairman George Garcia told reporters on Viber on Thursday, January 26. “[But] to fully automate is unlikely at this point. We are halfway the printing of ballots for the conduct of manual elections,” he added. Automating the barangay elections would likely require additional funding, as the Comelec is already just trying to get by with the budget it has on hand to mount the October polls. Its original budget was P8.4 billion, but that was when the electoral exercise was scheduled in December 2022. A rescheduling meant that more new voter applicants are now eligible to cast their ballots, incurring additional costs on the part of the Comelec. The approved 2023 budget included an additional P2.7 billion for the conduct of the village polls, although the Comelec initially wanted P10 billion to account for its proposed increase in poll workers’ honoraria. Since 2010, the Philippines has been automating its national and local elections, but Filipinos still vote manually during barangay elections. – Rappler.com"

The attack, which also left two others wounded, took place in the remote village of Pina, located approximately 200 kilometers southwest of Dipolog City. As fear and uncertainty spread throughout the community, military and police forces were swiftly deployed to the predominantly Muslim town of Sirawai in Zamboanga del Norte’s 3rd District, in a bid to prevent any further acts of violence or retaliation. According to police reports, the armed group targeted barangay chairman Ali Manangca and his family members in a ruthless assault that shook the community to its core. The village chief, alongside his wife Anisa Jaji, Ani, Alfahad Manangca, and Shilben Musaddin Basa, were brutally killed in the attack. Colonel Glenn Dulawan, commander of the Zamboanga del Norte Police Provincial Command, said two others in the barangay chairman’s group – Alwaf Basa Manangca and Norman Darus Tulino – survived the ambush. The victims were traveling in a pick-up truck that was riddled with bullets on a road in Pina, indicating that the attackers used high-powered firearms and planned to kill everyone inside. Dulawan said investigators have theorized that the ambush was carried out by a group with an old grudge against Manangca, the village chief of nearby Barangay Balubuan in Sirawai. The tragic incident prompted a rapid response from troops from the Army’s 42nd Infantry Battalion, the Philippine National Police’s 905th Regional Mobile Force Battalion, and the Sirawai town police, who stepped up security measures in the town and launched pursuit operations to track down the perpetrators of this heinous crime. – Rappler.com"

Stewart, known for his 1970s hits “Maggie May” and “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?,” called in to a Sky News program about the crisis in Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) that had been taking calls from members of the public. “This is heartbreaking for the nurses,” Stewart said. “It really is heartbreaking. In all my years of living in this country, I’ve never seen it so bad.” The state-funded NHS, until recently a source of pride for many Britons, is under severe strain after years of relative underinvestment and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting nurses and other staff to take unprecedented strike action. “I think this government should stand down now, and give the Labor Party a go at it,” 78-year-old Stewart said, noting that he personally had been a Conservative for a long time. Recent opinion polls have given Labor a strong lead over the Conservatives after a year in which the party ousted two prime ministers and Britons struggled with a cost-of-living crisis. The party has been in power since 2010. Stewart also said it was “ridiculous” that he had checked into an empty private clinic for a health scan on Wednesday, January 25 when there were so many other patients “dying because they cannot get scans.” He then offered to pay for 10 or 20 health scans for members of the public and hoped others who could do so would follow his lead. “I don’t need the publicity. I just want to do some good things,” he said, before ending the call by singing the opening lyrics to “Maggie May”. “Wake up Maggie, I think I’ve got something to say to you,” he sang in his trademark raspy voice that made that song a hit in 1971 after Stewart went solo following stints in the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces. – Rappler.com"

Protesters in civilian clothes who identified themselves as police first attacked Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s official residence, according to a Reuters witness, and then flooded the airport as Henry was arriving from a trip to Argentina. Henry was temporarily stuck in the airport, but returned to his residence in Port-au-Prince later on Thursday, followed by police protesters. A Reuters witness heard heavy gunfire near his home. Haiti’s National Police and the Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Roads around Port-au-Prince and in several cities to the north were blocked by protesters. A group of US government officials were visiting Haiti at the time, and a US State Department spokesperson said all Washington’s personnel were accounted for and they had moved some meetings as a precaution. Haitian human rights group RNDDH said in a statement that 78 police officers had been killed since Henry came to power in July 2021, averaging five each month, saying the prime minister and the head of the national police Frantz Elbe were “responsible for each of the 78 lives lost during their reign.” “History will remember they did nothing to protect and preserve the lives of these agents who chose to serve their country,” it added. Late on Thursday, The Bahamas’ foreign ministry said the country’s prime minister had ordered all Bahamians, including its diplomatic personnel, to leave Haiti as soon as security conditions permit. Haitian police had earlier in the day stopped the neighboring country’s local charge d’affaires and taken their vehicle and weapons, it added, saying all its diplomats were safe, as well as five citizens who had been trapped around the airport. Last week, four police officers near the capital were killed by the Vitelhomme gang, while shootouts on Wednesday with the Savien gang in the town of Liancourt left another seven officers dead, according to Haiti’s National Police and local media reports. US Assistant Secretary of State Brian Nichols expressed condolences to the families of police officers killed in the latest violence, and said the United States would continue to “impose costs on those responsible for this heinous violence.” Asked how the developments could affect efforts to craft an international armed intervention, the U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters the United States was still working with international partners to develop “a framework” for a security mission to “provide security and stability.” The United Nations is discussing sending a foreign strike force to confront the criminal groups.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/remains-slain-ofw-jullebee-ranara-come-home-january-27-2023/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The remains of overseas Filipino worker (OFW) Jullebee Ranara, who was found dead in a desert in Kuwait, are set to return to the Philippines on Friday, January 27. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the burnt remains of Ranara, a 35-year-old domestic worker, were found on Saturday, January 21. The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) said that within 24 hours, Kuwaiti police had arrested a 17-year-old suspect, who was the son of Ranara’s employer. Kuwaiti media reported on the incident on Sunday night, January 22. According to Kuwaiti publication Arab Times, Ranara’s autopsy report showed she was pregnant. But Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople said in a press briefing on Friday that she has not seen official documents pertaining to the circumstances of her death, and could not confirm if Ranara was indeed pregnant. What is clear is that Ranara was killed, and a criminal case is being pursued, Ople said. According to the DMW, Ranara contacted her family on Friday, January 20, expressing fears about her employer’s son. By Saturday, the family could no longer contact her. Her body was found soon after. “Ang nakakalungkot lang, kung mayroon lang sanang mga kahit ilang araw after that ano, na nai-report sa amin ng pamilya or ng recruitment agency na may ganoon ngang nangyayari involving the son, we could have done something, or at least tried our best na ialis siya doon sa environment na iyon,” said Ople on the January 27 press briefing. (The sad thing is, if there were only a few more days after that, where her family or recruitment agency could have reported to us that this was happening with the son, we could have done something, or at least tried our best to remove her from that environment.) Ranara’s recruitment agency in Kuwait had “immediately” gone to the police, and was also instrumental in identifying her body, Ople said. The DMW earlier condemned the incident and urged the Kuwaiti government to work on the early resolution of the case and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The DFA announced on Thursday, January 26, Ranara’s repatriation. DFA Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said that the suspect’s family agreed to pay for repatriation fees, and that the father had “no problem” funding it. According to Ople, Ranara’s family requested for an autopsy once the remains arrive, to be performed by the National Bureau of Investigation. Preparations for a two-week wake are also underway. On Friday, Kuwait Ambassador to the Philippines Musaed Saleh Althwaikh wrote to Ranara’s mother Norlinda Casim Cabiles to condole with their family. “Ms. Jullebee will receive justice and the suspect will be punished accordingly,” wrote Althwaikh. DMW Undersecretary Hans Cacdac also said that a representative from the Kuwait embassy in the Philippines visited the DMW on Thursday to express sympathies as well. The embassy official said that the incident was “met with outrage by the Kuwaiti society,” and that “no stone will be left unturned until the individuals behind this crime will be arrested and brought to justice.” Ople said that the DMW, the DFA, and the DFA-hired lawyer have yet to further discuss how to go about the pursuit of justice, as questions remain over how Kuwaiti laws penalize minors who have committed crimes. On Thursday, Ople shut down calls for an OFW deployment ban to Kuwait. While the DMW “[appreciates] the good intentions behind the calls,” Ople said that social dialogue is the “all-important first step” in resolving labor migration concerns. “It does not mean we are insensitive to such calls. It only means that for now, we wish to resort to labor diplomacy to add more safeguards and ensure that justice is pursued on behalf of Jullebee and her family,” said Ople. The DMW said it acknowledged and appreciated the quick response of Kuwaiti authorities in Ranara’s case. They also extended assistance in facilitating the repatriation of OFWs who have been staying at shelters. “There is a working, productive relationship between the Philippines and Kuwait that can be further enhanced not by imposing a deployment ban but by revisiting the existing Bilateral Labor Agreement (BLA),” said Ople. A new BLA would give more protection to OFWs, she said. In the Friday press briefing, Ople said some additional safeguards the two governments would discuss include stricter screening, accreditation, and evaluation of employers and recruitment agencies. Ople said that the imposition of a ban would “delay” the opportunity for reforms. “Usually, when you say you will impose a ban, the two countries will not discuss anything. But in this particular case, our priority is to have the full cooperation of the Kuwaiti government so we can, as promised to the family, advance the pursuit of justice,” said Ople in a mix of Filipino and English. Of the 268,100 OFWs in Kuwait as of December 2022, around 73% are female domestic workers, DMW numbers show. Cases of OFWs abused and killed in the Middle East have been a recurring national and diplomatic concern. For instance, one of the reasons why the Philippines implemented a deployment ban to Saudi Arabia in November 2021 was because of allegations of a retired general abusing several Filipino workers. The deployment ban to Saudi Arabia was lifted in November 2022, following bilateral talks between the two governments on reforms that would better protect OFWs. These include a new Standard Employment Contract that allows Filipino domestic workers who are abused or not paid their salaries the right to pre-terminate their contracts. – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/duterte-back-limelight-pampanga-adopted-son-resumes-attacks-lopezes/,[],"MABALACAT, Philippines – After keeping a low profile since the inauguration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., former president Rodrigo Duterte stepped back into the limelight this week with trademark rants and attacks against pet peeves. Duterte on Thursday, January 26, attended a grand Pampanga fête at the Royce Hotel in Clark Freeport Zone where he was honored as the province’s “adopted son” – and proceeded to unload old broadsides on the Lopezes, ABS-CBN, and the Ayalas. Three days earlier, on January 23, Duterte, accompanied by his daughter, Vice President Sara, was the guest of honor at the 89th birthday party in Bacolod City of Olivia Yanson, the matriarch of the family that owns Vallacar Transit, one of Asia’s biggest bus fleets. There, Duterte also raved, hurling curses as he defended his “war on drugs,” and saying he wasn’t through. Pampanga Governor Delta Pineda, his mother and Vice Governor Lilia, former president and House Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo led more than 700 politicians and social bigwigs in giving tribute to Duterte. The Pampanga Provincial Information Office said that Duterte’s designation as “adopted son of Pampanga” was formalized by Resolution No. 7643 of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Provincial Legislature) which Governor Pineda signed. Senator Bong Go, Duterte’s former personal assistant and still his constant companion, also received recognition for his “Malasakit Centers.” In a short speech, Arroyo said the province had also recognized the late president Fidel V. Ramos “as an adopted Kapampangan” for giving more than P555 million for Pampanga’s megadike. “Ano pa kayo na bilyon bilyon ang binigay nyo dito sa Pampanga,” she said to loud applause. (More so with you, who gave billions to Pampanga.) Arroyo said that a combination of infrastructure projects and “soft aid” like health contributed to the province having the lowest poverty rate in the country. Contrary to her claim, however, the latest poverty statistics released by the Philippine Statistics Authority in August 2022 estimated the poverty incidence among families in Pampanga at 2.9%, with Ilocos Norte (1.7%), Siquijor (2.2%), and Batanes (2.6%) having lower rates. The Pampanga Information Office showed a short clip of Duterte’s partial response, cutting the video after he thanked his hosts. But in a longer video posted by a barangay captain, Duterte said he would ditch his prepared speech. “I’m retired. As a former president, I would like to unload yung mga nakuha ko (what I learned) along the way so that you better understand the presidency and the politics that surround choosing a leader for the country.” Duterte said his six years as president was very hard. He then went on a rambling rant. “I just would like to say something, na ang binara ko talaga… na ano, the likes of ABS-CBN, tapos yung mga Lopezes na negosyo.” (The ones I hit hard, the likes of ABS-CBN, then the Lopezes and their businesses.) “Kaya sabi ko noong eleksyon, sa Davao at sa ibang lugar, yung corruption sa police, Customs, wala yan, maski sa airport, maliit diyan. Sabi ko, ang pinakamalaki nandito sa taas. (That’s why I said during the elections, in Davao and other places, that corruption in the police, Customs, that’s nothing, even in the airport, that’s small fry. I said the biggest fish are here at the top.) “And true enough, when I became the president, nakita ko yung very lopsided in favor of the rich people, na walang second choice. Sila lang. Just imagine ang pera.” (I saw how lopsided it was in favor of the rich people, and there was no second choice. Only them. Imagine the wealth.) The barangay captain’s video also showed Duterte briefly mentioning Manila Water and the Ayalas but it was shut off before he went into details. In Bacolod City, Duterte started off mellow, thanking the Yanson family for helping him, from his campaign for the presidency “until I finished my term.” It degenerated into a tirade as he defended his “war on drugs.” “We must continue the watch against drugs because we have to take care of the next generation,” said Duterte. Addressing drug personalities, Duterte warned that he was not through. “P***ina ninyo … Do not destroy the youth. P**ina, papatayin ko talaga kayo.” In Pampanga, the province’s video tribute opened with old news footage of Duterte saying, “I am ready to start my war for the nation.” The video placed his “war on drugs” and the war against corruption at the top of the former president’s contributions to the country. Duterte’s bloody campaign was carried out with promises to shield cops accused of human rights violations and attacks on critics of his brutal tactics. It has since come under a harsh light due to a series of arrests linking police and other anti-drug agencies to big drug seizures. The irony has raised howls of rage among the families of those who faced Duterte’s jeers as they sought justice for kin slain in his campaign. An intelligence officer of the Philippine National Police Drug Enforcement Group (DEG), the police unit tasked with leading the country’s anti-drug campaign, was arrested in October 2022 after his ID, belongings and “incriminating documents” were found during a raid that led to the seizure of 990 kilograms of shabu (methamphetamine) worth P6.7 billion in Tondo, Manila. In December 2022, the city of Taguig suspended ties with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) after its local chief and two agents were caught in a drug bust. Even Duterte’s successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., while refusing to blame him, criticized the police who implemented his campaign, intimating that some may be in the narcotics trade. In an interview with the Associated Press during his September 2022 visit to the United States, Marcos said his administration was going after them. On January 4, 2023, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos asked full police colonels and generals to file their courtesy resignation as part of efforts to purge the Philippine National Police of cops with drug links. –Rappler.com"

Gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a faster-than-expected 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year as consumers boosted spending on goods, the US Department of Commerce said. Inflation data improved too, as personal consumption expenditures growth slowed to 2.1% year over year from 2.3% in the prior quarter while the GDP price index decelerated to 3.5%. But the Fed’s hefty interest rate hikes last year eroded demand and slowed growth toward the end of 2022, posing tough choices for US central bank policymakers as they contemplate how much higher rates need to go when they meet next week. MSCI’s all-country world index, a gauge of stocks in 47 countries, rose 0.90% to hit a fresh five-month high, while the dollar index rose 0.246%. “The market is pricing in a Fed pivot where they actually cut rates by the end of the year,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson in Seattle, adding Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to indicate any move next week. “What Powell has pushed back on a lot is to not really think about lowering rates at all,” Ragan said. “But they are willing to pause and hold rates at a high level for a certain period of time.” Futures are pricing a 94.7% probability of a 25-basis-points hike next Wednesday, February 1, and see the Fed’s overnight rate at 4.45% by next December, or lower than the 5.1% rate Fed officials have projected into next year on market expectations of a rate cut. Treasury yields rose as the resilient economy strengthened the case for the Fed to maintain its hawkish stance in coming months as it seeks to cool inflation. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 3.6 basis points to 3.498% and the gap between yields on 3-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes, seen as a recession harbinger, narrowed to -117.9 basis points. “On balance, the data being better than expected suggests there’s more resilience in the economy than many have given it credit,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Convera in Washington. “The fact that inflation figures in the Q4 data moderated suggests it’s a Goldilocks scenario.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.61%, the S&P 500 gained 1.10%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.76%. In Europe, the broad STOXX 600 index closed up 0.42%. While talk of recession likely is overdone, the market is not cheap, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at private wealth manager The Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California. “Investors should not assume that the easy times in the market are coming back,” he said. “I don’t think people should be in a hurry to go back to excessive risk.” Overnight in Asia, equities rose to a seven-month high, with Hong Kong shares playing catchup to other markets’ gains as trade resumed after a three-day Lunar New Year holiday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.1% and was set for its fifth straight day of gains. Oil prices rose more than 1% on Thursday on expectations demand will strengthen as top oil importer China reopens its economy and on positive US economic data. US crude futures settled up 86 cents at $81.01 a barrel, and Brent rose $1.35 to settle at $87.47. Gold edged down after the strong US data.

The incident, publicized by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), comes on the heels of Marcos’ earlier announcement that Chinese President Xi Jinping had promised to “find a compromise” on the “plight of [Filipino] fishermen.” In response, the PCG said it would investigate the incident and would refer it to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) for further action, such as the filing of a diplomatic protest. Similar incidents in the past have shown that protests were not often filed immediately, and in some instances, could take weeks or months before they were transmitted to China. Why is this the case? And why do protests take time to file? DFA Spokesperson Ambassador Tess Daza explained to reporters in a press briefing on Thursday, January 26, that the agency must first wait for reports from other government agencies involved in patrolling the West Philippine Sea. This includes the PCG or in other cases, the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The reports, she added, contain both verified details and an assessment of a particular incident, which will then be tackled by the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS). The task force, headed by National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, then convenes agencies involved in the West Philippine Sea to coordinate a response. “With the NTF-WPS then, some decisions will be made in terms of the action that will be taken,” Daza said. “There is an inter-agency process of cross checking and when warranted, a protest is issued.” Daza said that because protests filed serve as legal documents, any detail mentioned by the Philippines must be thoroughly vetted. “I’ve always repeated the line that we are awaiting reports but the DFA will take the appropriate diplomatic action based on the verification and assessment of the incident,” she said. Often, this process can take days or weeks to be completed as officials confirm details on the ground and submit reports to their respective agencies, which later share information with one another. “Sometimes the (verification) process takes time but we seek your understanding that while it takes some time, there is no intention to vacillate in terms of what we are supposed to do,” Daza said. Under the Marcos administration, as of January 3, 2023, the DFA has filed at least 68 notes verbales against China over incidents in the West Philippine Sea. The DFA vowed to continue filing protests to uphold and assert the rights of Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea. “Our business is making sure we continue to dialogue and ensure representation…. We are committed to remain vigilant in monitoring our waters. We will not be remiss in our responsibly to do what actually needs to be done,” Daza said. – Rappler.com"

Ministers are looking at ways to encourage British and overseas students to take more part-time jobs to deal with shortages in areas such as hospitality and retail, the report said, citing government sources. Discussions have begun within the government about either raising the cap on paid work hours on foreign students to 30 hours per week from 20 hours currently or removing it entirely, the report added. Government sources told The Times that ministers were looking at “what more we can do to remove barriers and encourage students to work” and lifting the cap on foreign students’ hours was “part of a swathe of ideas being considered.” The idea is at an early stage and has yet to be agreed across government, the report said.

https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-united-states-q4-2022/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – The US economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter, but that likely exaggerates the nation’s health as a measure of domestic demand rose at its slowest pace in two and a half years, reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. The Department of Commerce’s advance fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) report on Thursday, January 26, showed half of the boost to growth came from a sharp rise in inventory held by businesses, some of which is likely unwanted. While consumer spending maintained a solid pace of growth, a big chunk of the increase in consumption was early in the fourth quarter. Retail sales weakened sharply in November and December. Business spending on equipment contracted last quarter and is likely to remain on the backfoot as demand for goods softens. It could be the last quarter of solid GDP growth before the lagged effects of the Federal Reserve’s fastest monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s are fully felt. Most economists expect a recession by the second half of the year, though a short and mild one compared to previous downturns, because of extraordinary labor market strength. “The US economy isn’t falling off a cliff, but it is losing stamina and risks contracting early this year,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “That should limit the Fed to just two more small rate increases in coming months.” GDP increased at a 2.9% annualized rate last quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2% pace in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would rise at a 2.6% rate. Robust second-half growth erased the 1.1% contraction in the first six months of the year. For 2022, the economy expanded 2.1%, down from the 5.9% logged in 2021. The Fed last year raised its policy rate by 425 basis points from near zero to a 4.25%-4.50% range, the highest since late 2007. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, grew at a 2.1% rate, mostly reflecting a rebound in goods spending at the start of the quarter, mostly on motor vehicles. Consumers also spent on services like health care, housing, utilities, and personal care. Spending, which grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter, has been underpinned by labor market resilience as well as excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased at a 3.3% rate after rising at a 1% pace in the third quarter. The saving rate rose to 2.9% from 2.7%. But demand for long-lasting manufactured goods, which are mostly bought on credit, has fizzled and some households, especially lower income, have depleted their savings. As a result, inventories surged at a $129.9-billion rate compared to a $38.7-billion rate in the prior quarter, adding 1.46 percentage points to GDP growth. There also were contributions from government spending and a smaller trade deficit. Stripping out inventories, government spending, and trade, domestic demand increased at only a 0.2% rate. That was the smallest increase in private domestic final sales since the second quarter of 2020 and was a deceleration from the third quarter’s 1.1% pace. “Rising inventories could bode poorly for growth in early 2023 as corporations may look to reduce excess stocks of goods,” said Erik Norland, senior economist, CME Group. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of US Treasuries fell. Despite clear signs of a weak handover to 2023, some economists are cautiously optimistic the economy will skirt an outright recession, suffering instead a rolling downturn where sectors decline in turn rather than all at once. They argue that monetary policy now acts with a shorter lag than was previously the case because of advances in technology and the US central bank’s transparency, which they said resulted in financial markets and the real economy acting in anticipation of rate hikes. Though residential investment suffered its seventh straight quarterly decline, the longest such streak since the collapse of the housing bubble triggered the 2007-2009 Great Recession, there are signs the housing market could be stabilizing. Mortgage rates have been trending lower as the Fed slows the pace of its rate hikes. “A large portion of the reaction to higher interest rates is already in the economy and the financial markets,” said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “Since the Fed has succeeded in precipitating a rolling recession, it is time to think about an exit strategy.” Inflation also subsided in the fourth quarter. A measure of inflation in the economy rose at a 3.2% rate, retreating from the third quarter’s 4.8% pace of increase. While many parts of the economy have shifted to lower gear, the labor market is showing no signs of substantial cooling. A separate report from the Department of Labor on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 186,000 for the week ended Saturday, January 21, the lowest level since April 2022. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 20,000 to 1.675 million for the week ended January 14. Companies outside the technology industry as well as interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and finance are hoarding workers after struggling to find labor during the pandemic. “There are no signs in the latest jobless claims data that the labor market is cracking at the start of the new year,” said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. – Rappler.com"

Marcos shows that the late president deposited 1.1 billion metric tons of gold bullion in a special trust deposit. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video containing the claim has over 7,700 views as of writing. Not enough gold: The declared amount of gold bullion in the alleged certificate is just ridiculous. There’s not enough gold mined throughout history for Marcos to deposit this much gold in a trust account. According to the latest World Gold Council (WGC) records, the total above-ground stocks of gold had only reached 205,231 metric tons in 2022. Above-ground gold refers to all the gold mined throughout history. The amount of above-ground gold was even way less during Marcos’ time. According to M. G O’Callaghan’s book The Structure and Operation of the World Gold Market published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1991, only 94,665 metric tons of gold had been mined throughout history. Marcos died in 1989. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says that around 244,000 metric tons of gold have been discovered to date, including both above-ground and below-ground gold stock. Using these figures, it can be estimated that there are only 38,769 metric tons of gold left to be mined. – Lorenz Pasion/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/nation/where-economists-stand-charter-change-bills-house-public-consultation-january-2023/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – The House of Representatives’ constitutional amendments panel convened only for the second time under the 19th Congress on Thursday, January 26, to zero in on numerous proposals seeking to amend or revise the 1987 Constitution. Economic experts and other analysts took the spotlight in the latter half of the six-hour marathon hearing, providing inputs on at least two bills that seek to relax the charter’s economic provisions. The measures filed by congressmen Lord Allan Velasco and Gus Tambunting specifically seek to include the phrase “unless otherwise provided by law” in some of the provisions in a bid to entice more foreign investors to come to the Philippines. So, what was the advice of the invited resource speakers? Former socio-economic planning chief Winnie Monsod is adamant against an economic charter change, saying she has not seen compelling evidence-based arguments in its favor. Proponents have said that easing restrictions would result in more foreign direct investments (FDIs), but Monsod insisted that FDIs “most often found to have a positive relationship with growth and development,” such as those aimed at firms producing manufactured exports, are not restricted by the Constitution. “The evidence, from studies conducted both abroad and domestically, do not support the underlying assumption that FDI will lead to growth and other ‘goodies,'” added Monsod, a professor emeritus of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Economics. Monsod also argued that amending the Constitution is not a necessary condition to attract FDIs, adding that it may just incur additional costs to the Philippine government. Picking up from where Monsod left off, IBON Foundation executive director Sonny Africa pointed out that FDIs have been increasing in the Philippines, “the first wave in the 1990s, and the next wave in the 2010s.” “We do think that foreign investments can be a tool for development. We disagree there are binding constraints. We would argue that after 40 years of liberalization, they’re among the last regulatory tools we have to hold on,” he said. IBON Foundation is a research outfit that releases studies on economic and social issues. “It should be striking to many that the Philippines now has more foreign investment in absolute terms, and has a share of GDP higher than Taiwan, South Korea, and China in their respective periods of economic takeoff,” he added, comparing the Philippines to more developed countries. National scientist Raul Fabella is critical of the 1987 charter, saying it “shows the distrust of its framers on future governments to act wisely.” He suggested that some provisions be dropped, such as Section 11, Article 12, which states that Filipinos should own not less than 60% of a Philippine business. “It restricts foreign ownership to 40% capital, thus minority interest. The new PSA [Public Service Act] law has reduced the compass of this restriction, but I think we still need to move further than the law,” he said. UP School of Economics professor emeritus Gerardo Sicat is in favor of amending the economic provisions of the Constitution, specifically those that limit the participation of foreign investors. “In the course of our independence, we did not have sufficient capital, so we gave poor service, and we did not bring in foreign capital because our Constitution prevented this. What happened? We had bad service in electricity, bad service in telephone, bad service in water,” he said. “If we do not get a major effort to show to the world that we are inviting foreign capital, even the great effort of our president to travel abroad and try to convince big investors to come will always say, ‘What about your Constitution?’” Sicat added. Foundation for Economic Freedom president Calixto Chikiamco also said it’s high time to amend or revise the 1987 Constitution. “The protectionist economic model it espoused promoted a rent-seeking system which manipulates public policy to increase profits for the few,” he said. “It is not a model that encourages sustainable growth for the economy as a whole. As such, our economy has fallen farther behind its neighboring peers.” The Foundation for Economic Freedom is a non-profit organization espousing various economic and political concerns. Former finance chief Margarito Teves supports an economic charter change, saying the move would enable the country to attract quality investors. “With globalization, increase in foreign trade, agreements and large corporations investing overseas, the current restrictive economic provisions are no longer aligned with these trends. These include foreign ownership of land, exploitation of natural resources, or equity in mass media and advertising, education, and the foreign practice of profession,” he said. The UP political science department was also invited to join the panel of economists. Its chairman, Professor Aries Arugay, called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to make clear how he perceives charter change discussions in Congress. He noted that past administrations since 1986 instituted an executive-driven constitutional revision agenda. “It is essential that the current executive leadership define where it stands on constitutional revision and the process it envisions as well as identify the responsible authorities who will oversee it,” he said. House constitutional amendments panel chairman Rufus Rodriguez said Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president’s cousin, is hands off on the current charter change discussions. “There is no directive. We are independent as a committee, and we will present our findings to the plenary for the discussion of everyone,” he told Rappler after the hearing. “The discussions were very fruitful. We will continue two weeks from now. We want to hear as much as possible everyone who has something to contribute. We intend to have seven consultations,” he added. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/drag-den-stars-naia-black-shewarmas-advice-queer-youth/,['AMANDA T. LAGO'],"MANILA, Philippines – After seven chaotic, dizzying, fabulous episodes, homegrown drag reality show Drag Den Philippines arrived at its finale, where one contender went home with the title of being the Philippines’ first Drag Supreme. Out of the crop of eight contestants, three drag artists rose to the top three: seasoned drag mother Maria Cristina, and up-and-coming queens NAIA Black and Shewarma. Both NAIA and Shewarma were shocked after making it to the top three, though both of them also knew they deserved it. NAIA, who was eventually crowned the winner, said she had expected that a more veteran queen would make it to the finals. “I was absolutely shocked because, you know, mga beterana kasama namin dito eh (we’re surrounded by veterans here). I was just immensely grateful at the moment. It was overwhelming in the literal sense because I didn’t know how to compose myself,” NAIA told Rappler at a Drag Den press conference on Tuesday, January 24. It was no doubt a proud moment for both queens. For Shewarma, it was even more meaningful, because it signified her mother’s acceptance of her art. “Sobrang proud ko sa sarili ko rin kahit nasa top three palang ako dahil proud sakin yung nanay ko, kasi before hindi siya proud sa ginagawa ko. Now, sobrang proud na siya. Dun palang, panalo na ko,” she shared. (I am so proud of myself because even if I’m just in the top three, my mom is already proud of me. Before this, she wasn’t proud of what I was doing. Now, she’s really proud. With that alone, I feel like a winner.) As young queens early on in their drag careers, NAIA and Shewarma had to go up against drag artists who had years of experience – no mean feat for those who have only been doing drag for a short period of time. For NAIA, she drew confidence from knowing both her capabilities and her flaws. “I think the confidence comes from trusting in your capabilities and knowing where you can improve upon,” she said. “Kung alam mo kung saan ka nagfafalter (where you falter), work on it, or you’re supposed to work on it, and that’s what I learned on Drag Den.” She also highlighted the importance of making mistakes. “I’m not placing myself on a pedestal and saying ako lang may kaya nito (I’m the only one who can do this)…everyone can do this as long as you put in the work and believe in yourself and respect those who came before you. And don’t be afraid to make mistakes cos I made a lot of mistakes on Drag Den that until now never ko na inulit (I never repeated)…you can’t be afraid…cos you’re never gonna put yourself out there, you’re never gonna take that dive,” she said. As both queens shared, being confident and trusting one’s self is applicable not only to drag queens or artists, but also to LGBTQ+ people in general, especially those who are still learning to embrace their identitiy. “Maniwala kayo sa sarili niyo. Huwag niyong hahayaan kunin ng ibang tao yung gusto niyo gawin. Kailangan kayo muna magtitiwala sa sarili niyo bago yung ibang tao,” Shewarma said. (Believe in yourself. Don’t let others take what you want to do. You have to believe in yourself first.) Whether in drag or in life, NAIA also encouraged people to experiment, and not to limit themselves to one thing or brand. “Don’t be afraid to explore, because you can’t define yourself agad (right away). That’s my advice to baby drag queens. They try to brand themselves agad (right away)…when in fact, it’s like sexuality, it’s like your sexual orientation, where you have to experiment first only in the literal sense, right?” she said. “Don’t be too hard on yourselves when you’re still trying to learn yourself. Cos that’s me on Drag Den. I wasn’t too hard on myself when I didn’t know. I was just moving forward and trying to learn from my mistakes,” she said. As Drag Den puts the spotlight on Filipino queens yet again (something that Drag Race Philippines did in 2022), NAIA and Shewarma look forward to the growth of the local drag scene. “Gusto ko maging masa yung drag here in the Philippines dahil for me, bago pausbungin yung drag ng Philippines sa ibang bansa, dapat pausbungin muna natin yung drag mismo sa Philippines,” Shewarma said. (I want drag to go mainstream here in the Philippines, because for me, before Filipino drag thrives internationally, it has to thrive here first.) “Super saya dahil mayroon na tayong two shows in 2022 and 2023 and sana mas madagdagan pa…dahil deserve namin ng platform, dahil hindi biro yung ginagawa namin,” she said. (It’s great because we’ve had two shows in 2022 and 2023 and I hope there will be more…because we deserve a platform, because what we do isn’t easy.) “Drag is only gonna get more and more popular here in the Philippines,” NAIA added, explaining that drag has always been around, but only as a niche community before. “But now you have a lot of women and their boyfriends coming to watch shows, and the spotlight is really on the Philippine drag scene, that it’s a force to be reckoned with in the whole drag community sa buong mundo (around the world),” she said. She likened the Filipino drag scene to the Filipino pageant scene, saying that Filipinos are becoming known for being “a force to be reckoned with” on the international stage. “I think now that we have these shows, Drag Den has really put us on the map, put the local drag scene on the map, gave the local drag scene the spotlight and now the world sees us,” she said.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/icc-warrants-stage-duterte-government-drug-war-killings/,['LIAN BUAN'],"LONDON, United Kingdom – The International Criminal Court (ICC) has ended its waiting game with the Philippines. After more than a year, on Thursday evening Dutch time, January 26, the ICC said the pre-trial chamber authorized the resumption of the investigation into killings under the bloody drug war of former president Rodrigo Duterte. The Philippines government got a reprieve in November 2022 when the ICC paused the investigation as a procedural response to a clever move by the Philippine embassy in the Netherlands to ask for a deferral. (READ: Timeline: The International Criminal Court and Duterte’s bloody war on drugs) During this period, the Philippine government was given a chance to submit more proof that it was willing and able to genuinely investigate the killings on its own. Had the ICC been satisfied with that, it would have ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case due to the principle of complementarity. However, prosecutor Karim Khan, who replaced Fatou Bensouda – the woman who opened the case in the first place – was not satisfied and requested the pre-trial chamber twice to reopen. This latest move is the chamber approving Khan’s request, moving along the process and starting a crucial new stage. “Following a careful analysis of the materials provided by the Philippines, the Chamber is not satisfied that the Philippines is undertaking relevant investigations that would warrant a deferral of the Court’s investigations on the basis of the complementarity principle,” the ICC said in its report Thursday, signed by judges Péter Kovács, Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini-Gansou, and María del Socorro Flores Liera. At this stage, the prosecutor’s office of Khan will seek evidence to potentially request the chamber to issue summons or warrants. For whom? That’s not clear as of the moment yet. Technically, no one in particular is the subject of the investigation yet, not even Duterte, who is named in all the reports thus far. But the ICC is usually interested in, if not the head of state, high-ranking officials. The scope of the investigation is not only the killings under Duterte’s drug war, but also the killings in Davao City when Duterte was mayor and vice mayor there from 2011 to 2016. The chamber has noted in its past report that it was also looking into the potential accountability of “regional or even local organs of the State.” Requesting for the summons or warrant, and getting approval of the chamber, is a process that has no definitive timeline. Even if a summons or a warrant is issued, the implementation is dependent on the cooperation of the law enforcement of that country, whether that’s in the Philippines which is no longer a member state, or if the subject is traveling to another country that is a member state. The weakness of the implementation system is the main criticism against the ICC. If the subject, whether that’s Duterte or any of his police generals, is never arrested, they can never be tried as the ICC does not hold trials in absentia. In the pre-trial chamber report published Thursday, the ICC said it “concluded that the various domestic initiatives and proceedings, assessed collectively, do not amount to tangible, concrete and progressive investigative steps in a way that would sufficiently mirror the Court’s investigation.” Duterte authorized a drug war review under his term, which was undertaken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) under former justice secretary, now Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’ solicitor general, Menardo Guevarra. The drug war review was the Philippines’ main defense that it was willing and able to investigate the killings on its own. “The DOJ Panel review does not amount to relevant investigations within the meaning of article 17 and 18 of the Statute. Moreover, the number of cases reviewed by the DOJ Panel (namely, 302) is very low when compared with the estimated number of killings that allegedly occurred in the context of ‘war on drugs’ operations,” said the ICC chamber. The Philippine government also tried to show as proof of willingness and ability the Joint Human Rights Programme with the United Nations, but the ICC said that was “irrelevant for the Chamber’s determination, as they are ‘regulatory and institutional reforms which have purportedly been adopted to strengthen national capacity’, and because the Philippines has not provided ‘concrete information about relevant investigations and/or prosecutions actually instituted pursuant to such reforms.’” Duterte unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from ICC in 2018 when then-prosecutor Bensouda opened the inquiry. President Marcos kept the policy, even as he projects a warmer attitude toward human rights before the international community. The ICC has granted limited immunity to former Davao City cop Arturo Lascañas, who has confessed to carrying out Duterte’s alleged kill orders to the DDS. Lascañas is in hiding, but, as an insider witness, he has access to the ICC’s witness protection program.“ This conclusion does not preclude the Philippines from providing material in the future in order for the Prosecution, or the Chamber, to determine inadmissibility on the basis of complementarity, if and when needed,” said the ICC. The ICC added, “Moreover, when any actual case is brought by the Prosecution, a further admissibility assessment may take place.” – Rappler.com"

Down by double digits in the fourth quarter against Meralco, NorthPort fought back and even grabbed the lead but ultimately fell short in a 107-102 defeat on Thursday, January 26. Roi Sumang and Marcus Weathers joined hands in a 13-2 run that swung an 87-94 deficit to a 97-96 edge before the Batang Pier crumbled, missing four of their last six field goals in the final 2:30 minutes. “We had some open shots that our players were unable to finish. But the effort was there,” said Tan in a mix of Filipino and English. Even as NorthPort remained winless, it performed significantly better compared to its conference opener against Converge, where it lost by 30 points last Sunday, January 22. The resurgence of Sumang proved to be a bright spot for the Batang Pier as he finished with 23 points on top of 6 assists, 3 rebounds, and 3 steals after putting up just 5 points against the FiberXers. “At least we’re one step forward. Hopefully, we can sustain this,” Tan added. “We feel we’ll win next game. Hopefully.” Tan also hopes to welcome back star guard Robert Bolick, who got reduced to a spectator in their first two games of the tournament. NorthPort said Bolick is out with a hamstring injury, although his absence has been attributed to his impending contract expiration at the end of January. Bolick averaged 20.1 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in the first two conferences this season as he currently ranks fourth in the statistical race for the MVP award. “We presented our offer sheet.

Wimbledon champion Rybakina wore down Azarenka in a contest that was cagey early on and had some wild momentum swings before she dominated her opponent at Rod Laver Arena to prevail. Rybakina held her nerve as 24th seed Azarenka foundered in a messy first set tiebreak then dropped serve twice to fall 5-2 behind in the second. The Kazakh was broken as she served for the set but Azarenka double-faulted to concede three match points in the next game, allowing Rybakina to close out an emphatic win. “I’m super happy and proud. Without my team it would be difficult to be here so thanks a lot to them,” Moscow-born Rybakina, Kazakhstan’s first Grand Slam champion, said on court. “It was an incredible atmosphere and I’m super happy to be in the final and play again here. “It was difficult conditions, I couldn’t play offensive tennis but I’m happy I managed to win.” Sabalenka joined the 22nd seed in the final after dismissing Linette following a cold start on a chilly evening on the main showcourt, as the 24-year-old reached her first Grand Slam final after three previous semifinal defeats. The victory also extended Sabalenka’s winning run this year to 10 matches following her successful march to the Adelaide title which warmed her up nicely for the season’s first major. “I’m super happy that I was able to get this win and she’s an unbelievable player,” Sabalenka said of Linette. “She played really great tennis. The atmosphere was unbelievable. “Just being in the final in this kind of tournament is amazing. To feel this atmosphere, to play on this court it’s a great experience for me and I hope it’s going to help tomorrow. Sorry, Saturday.” Rybakina’s serve has propelled her through the tournament, and she clubbed nine aces earlier against Azarenka. But she double-faulted on the first point of the match, raising a low gasp from the terraces. They needn’t have worried. She thumped down three consecutive aces to hold then served out to love in her next effort. After that start, it was a surprise when Azarenka picked her off at the net to break her in the fifth game. Rybakina shrugged it off then broke Azarenka twice, repeatedly outrallying the powerful Belarusian. Azarenka responded with her own firepower. Running full tilt, she saved a set point with a forehand passing shot and put the pressure back on Rybakina. The Kazakh cracked, hitting a backhand long, and Azarenka yelled “Let’s go!” as she put the match back on serve. Though failing to land a first serve 11 times in succession, Rybakina saved three break points at 5-5 before momentum shifted again when Azarenka tightened up in the tiebreak. The Belarusian double-faulted to fall 4-2 behind, punched a backhand long to concede two set points, then slapped a forehand well wide as she failed to deal with Rybakina’s aggression. Having lost the tiebreak, the errors piled up for Azarenka as she dropped serve again in the second set and all but surrendered with a wild forehand to fall 5-2 behind. Rybakina wobbled when serving out the match, a double-fault coughing up three break points and opening the door for Azarenka. But any hopes of a comeback slipped away as Azarenka imploded on serve. Though she saved a match point, her bid for a third title at Melbourne Park ended flatly, with a backhand hammered into the net, one of 27 unforced errors. “It’s kind of hard to digest, obviously,” a gloomy Azarenka told reporters, wearing sunglasses at her post-match media conference. “Obviously I had quite a few chances that I gave myself. “I cannot really say I’m really proud of how I played.” Geopolitics has been ever-present at the year’s first Grand Slam, with organizers making the unprecedented decision to ban Russian and Belarusian flags from the event after a complaint from the Ukraine embassy in Australia. Police questioned four fans with “inappropriate flags and symbols” at Melbourne Park following Wednesday’s quarterfinal between Novak Djokovic and Russian Andrey Rublev. Australian Open organizers on Thursday issued a reminder to players and their entourages about the policy after a video showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing for pictures with fans holding Russian flags was widely shared on social media. Serbian Djokovic, who plays American Tommy Paul in the men’s semifinals on Friday, did not comment on the video. Asked by reporters whether it was difficult to focus on tennis with the politics rumbling in the background, Azarenka lost patience. “I don’t know what you guys want us to do about it,” she snapped. “These incidents that in my opinion have nothing to do with players, but somehow you keep dragging players into it.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/europe-promote-buzz-lines-help-reverse-decline-bees-by-2030/,[],"BRUSSELS, Belgium – “Buzz Lines” for bees and other pollinators where they could move across Europe and find food and shelter were among measures laid out by the EU’s executive body on Tuesday, January 24, to reverse the decline of the insects vital for crop production. Currently, one in 10 bee and butterfly species and one in three hoverfly species is threatened with extinction. The seven-year plan presented by the EU will also increase monitoring of the insects across the 27 member states, aiming to halt population decline in pollinators that are crucial to the majority of crops and wild flowers. Changing land use, intensive agriculture with pesticides, pollution, invasive alien species, pathogens and climate change are among the threats facing pollinating insects. The European Parliament and the Council, representing EU governments, will need to endorse the plan. EU members will then have to identify measures to reverse the decline of pollinators by 2030, which will be a legal requirement under the EU’s Nature Restoration Law. Mitigating pesticide use and enhancing pollinator habitats in agricultural and urban areas were also recommended by the Commission, and the body will monitor emergency authorisations granted for harmful pesticides and prohibit use where not authorised. France, for example, has dropped plans to allow sugar beet growers to use a pesticide banned over risks to bees after a European Union court rejected such an exemption. The plan is a revision to a 2018 initiative that sought to improve knowledge and public awareness of the decline of pollinators. The EU has also restricted the use of three neonicotinoid pesticides that post a high risk to bees. However, a review found that current measures were not enough to reverse the pollinator decline. – Rappler.com"

Shedding weight during the break, McDaniels produced 32 points, 22 rebounds, and 4 assists as the Bolts got the job done in the endgame after squandering a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The win marked the second straight game McDaniels put up at least 20 points and 20 rebounds after recording 27 points and 23 rebounds in their conference-opening 105-87 victory over Rain or Shine last Sunday, January 22. Down 84-94 with under six minutes left, the Batang Pier erased that deficit behind a 13-2 blitz anchored by Roi Sumang to seize the upper hand, 97-96. Import Marcus Weathers sparked the run with a three-pointer, Sumang scored 8 straight points, and JM Calma sank the go-ahead bucket with three minutes remaining. But Meralco put the clamps on NorthPort late and banked on Chris Newsome, who scored 5 unanswered points in the final 1:20 minutes to give his side a 105-99 cushion. Newsome finished with 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists, Bong Quinto chalked up 15 points, and Cliff Hodge added 15 points and 9 rebounds in the win. Allein Maliksi fired 14 points for the Bolts, who welcomed back Aaron Black after he sat out the first game due to a knee contusion. Black tallied 3 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists in 27 minutes of play. As the Batang Pier missed star guard Robert Bolick anew due to a hamstring injury, Sumang took charge for the NorthPort locals with 23 points, 13 coming in the fourth quarter, on top of 6 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. Weathers also scattered 13 points in the last frame to wind up with 29 points, 14 rebounds, and 2 blocks. Their efforts, though, were not enough as the Batang Pier crashed to their second straight loss to start the conference. Arvin Tolentino netted 17 points and 7 rebounds in the losing effort.

https://www.rappler.com/business/china-open-borders-push-stoke-economy-may-revive-dealmaking/,[],"China’s reopened borders and renewed focus on boosting the sagging economy have brightened the deals outlook, with bankers starting to field interest for mergers, acquisitions, and fundraising involving the world’s second largest economy. The prospect of a revival in deals comes as Chinese policymakers try to restore private-sector confidence and growth, which has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and a sweeping regulatory crackdown. Although consumer, retail, and travel-related firms are expected to bounce back after an almost three-year lockdown, advisers say sectors linked to strengthening China’s economic prospects will be at the center of dealmaking this year. “We see strategic sectors, hardcore industrial technology, automation, semiconductor-related to be a focus for outbound activity,” said Mark Webster, partner and head of Singapore at BDA Partners, an Asia-focused investment banking adviser. “Healthcare opportunities are proving of interest, both domestically and outbound, including in Southeast Asia,” he added. “Geographically, Indonesia in particular is attracting a lot of attention.” Australia has also already emerged on China’s radar amid hopes of a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. In one such deal, Tianqi Lithium and IGO’s joint venture are bidding for lithium miner Essential Metals. Outbound M&A involving companies in China halved last year to the lowest point since 2006, Refinitiv data showed, which pulled total Chinese company-led dealmaking to its lowest point in nine years. Chinese companies’ capital markets deals slipped 44% in the same period, according to Refinitiv data. That slump crimped the fees earned by Wall Street banks and forced some of them to cut jobs, mainly those linked to Chinese deals, in the past few months. “We have had a lot more requests for proposals from companies in the past two to three weeks,” said Li He, a capital markets partner at law firm Davis Polk who traveled to Beijing to meet clients the day after China’s border reopened on January 8. “That is not just because of travel but people think that a reopening is good for the economy, good for capital markets, and good for deal execution,” He said. The reopening coincided with a thaw in regulatory scrutiny that had seen overseas Chinese initial public offerings grind to a halt in the past 18 months amid proposed rule changes, and the tech sector struggle with a range of new regulations. Until the border reopened, travel from Hong Kong into mainland China had been tightly restricted for about three years – a sharp change for advisers for whom weekly trips to China had been common. Opened borders could lead to a pickup in deals involving private equity funds later in 2023 as firms head to China to find buyers for their assets, according to Bagrin Angelov, head of China cross-border M&A at Chinese investment bank CICC. Chinese private equity activity was worth $24.1 billion in 2022, down from $57.8 billion a year before, Pitchbook data showed. “Six months or one year before the deal, private equity firms would already start meeting potential buyers to try to warm up the interest and try to understand who could be interested,” Beijing-based Angelov said. “For them certainty is very important, and they really need to meet buyers very early on,” he continued. “Because of opening up, we expect an uptick in overseas disposal of private equity to Chinese buyers.” – Rappler.com"

NAIA, who goes by Brian out of drag, was crowned by host and “Drag Lord” Manila Luzon at a coronation night on Thursday, January 26. Despite never having won a challenge throughout the show’s 8-episode run, NAIA consistently placed in the top. To cinch the crown, she competed against fellow finalists Maria Cristina and Shewarma in a national costume round, swimsuit round, long gown round, and lip-sync battle to Sarah Geronimo’s “Kilometro.” NAIA is relatively new to the drag scene, only learning to do makeup in 2018.

I was finding myself, finding my voice,” she said. “I didn’t come to the competition fully aware of my capabilities, but when I made it to the top three to the finale, and then post-Drag Den until now, I’ve shown such immense growth and I think that’s something that many young artists can hopefully look up to.” Drag Den Philippines is available on Prime Video. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-says-luxembourg-court-sets-aside-request-enforce-arbitration-award/,[],"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Malaysia’s law minister on Thursday, January 26, said a Luxembourg court had set aside an attempt made by the heirs of a former sultanate to enforce a $15 billion arbitration award they won against Malaysia. A French court last year had ordered Malaysia to pay $14.9 billion to the heirs of the last sultan of Sulu to honor a colonial-era land deal. Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration proceedings, maintains the process is illegal. It obtained a stay against the award’s enforcement in France, but the ruling remains enforceable outside France under a United Nations treaty on international arbitration. Malaysia’s law minister Azalina Othman Said said the District Court of Luxembourg on Tuesday had set aside a request for an “attachment order” made by the Sulu heirs. It was not immediately clear what impact, if any, the decision would make on the arbitration award. Azalina did not provide details of the court decision in a statement that described it as a “significant victory” for Malaysia. Paul Cohen, a lawyer for the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu, said the court ruling had “no bearing on the status of the arbitral award, in Luxembourg itself, or elsewhere.” “This is a preliminary ruling, on a preliminary measure, in one of several jurisdictions where we are seeking enforcement,” he said in an email to Reuters. “We have yet to even see the ruling – the same is true of Malaysia – so we’re not sure on what basis Malaysia is seeing fit to comment at this time.” The Luxembourg court could not immediately be reached for comment. Last July, two Luxembourg-based subsidiaries of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas were seized by court bailiffs as part of the heirs’ efforts to enforce the award. Azalina did not say whether the decision was related to the seizure of the Petronas units. “This decision vindicates the government’s policy to vigorously defend Malaysia in every forum to ensure that Malaysia’s interests, sovereign immunity and sovereignty are protected and preserved at all times,” Azalina said in a statement. Petronas has said it would contest any claims made on its assets. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/international-monetary-fund-staff-concluding-statement-japan-january-2023/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – The Bank of Japan (BOJ) should let government bond yields move more flexibly and be ready to raise short-term interest rates swiftly if “significant” upside risks to inflation materialize, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday, January 26. In a proposal after an annual policy consultation with Japan, the IMF said the central bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy remains appropriate as inflation is likely to fall back below its 2% target by the end of 2024 unless wages rise significantly. But with upside risks to inflation becoming more prominent in the world’s third biggest economy, the IMF said, the BOJ should give long-term yields freer rein, such as by raising its 10-year bond yield target or widening the range it tolerates. “We don’t see this as really changing the [BOJ’s] accommodative stance. It’s more to balance some of the impact on the real economy against the impact on financial markets,” IMF Japan Mission Chief Ranil Salgado said on Thursday. “It also makes it easier to begin the transition towards an eventual raising of the short-term rate,” he told Reuters, adding the BOJ could consider steps to enhance flexibility in bond yields even before its inflation target is durably met. With Japan’s core consumer inflation at a 41-year high 4%, double the BOJ’s target, markets have been betting the central bank will phase out its aggressive stimulus after dovish Governor Haruhiko Kuroda retires in April. Unlike central banks worldwide that have aggressively raised interest rates, the BOJ has stuck with an ultra-low rate policy, called yield curve control (YCC), that applies a negative interest rate to some short-term funds and targets the 10-year yield around zero. The global lender’s proposals contrast with those it made last year, when it urged the central bank to maintain ultra-loose policy to support Japan’s recovery from the damage of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Given the two-sided risks to inflation, more flexibility in long-term yields would help to avoid abrupt changes later. This would help better manage inflation risks and also help address the side-effects of prolonged easing,” the IMF said in a statement issued after the policy consultation. The IMF said the BOJ could also consider options such as targeting a shorter-term yield or the pace of its bond buying. Such steps, it said, would help mitigate the side effects of prolonged easing, such as distortions in the yield curve caused by the BOJ’s massive government bond purchases. If inflation risks heighten significantly, the BOJ must withdraw monetary support more forcefully, such as by raising short-term rates “much earlier and above the neutral rate” to anchor inflation back towards its 2% target, it said. A hike in short-term rates, however, is unlikely in the near term and can be considered only when there is clear evidence that wages will keep rising and help the BOJ durably achieve its inflation target, Salgado said in the interview. The BOJ surprised markets in December by doubling its allowance band for the 10-year yield to 0.5% above or below zero. It beefed up a market operation tool in January to defend the new cap, aiming to extend YCC’s lifespan. Aside from increased side effects of prolonged easing, the BOJ’s ultra-low interest rates have drawn fire from critics for causing the yen to plunge, boosting the cost of raw material imports that put more pressure on companies and households. The dollar touched a 32-year high around 152 yen last year, prompting authorities to intervene in the currency market to prop up the Japanese currency, though it has since rebounded to around 130. The IMF said while currency intervention could tame excessive volatility and keep the pace of yen moves better aligned with fundamentals, its effects are likely temporary. Intervention, then, “should be limited to special circumstances such as disorderly market conditions, risks to financial stability,” and concerns that foreign-exchange moves could de-anchor inflation expectations, the IMF said. – Rappler.com"

On Wednesday, January 25, thousands of travelers in Hainan’s Sanya City packed the CDF Mall, a shopping center dedicated to duty-free stores, where they stocked up on cosmetics and handbags while on break for the Lunar New Year holiday. “The UK is quite far and it’s hard to buy tickets,” said Yu Shunxiao, a student who said he used to shop at Harrods in London. “In Sanya, we can come and leave whenever we want.” In early January, following a broader nationwide relaxation of COVID-19 prevention policies, Beijing ended a long-standing requirement that all inbound travelers go into quarantine at a hotel immediately upon arrival. As a result, Chinese residents have rushed to travel overseas. On Trip.com, a popular ticket-booking site, international flight ticket purchases shot up over 200% the day after the policy change was announced. Luxury brands and retailers are hoping that an upcoming outbound tourism boom from China will bring in strong sales in 2023, just as a post-pandemic frenzy in the United States and Europe cools down. Despite this, some experts argue that an increasing portion of China’s luxury spending will remain inside the country’s borders, even though consumers can now travel freely. Jonathan Yan, at consultancy Roland Berger in Shanghai, told Reuters that the three-year period of closed borders has caused Chinese shoppers to get more accustomed to buying foreign luxury goods in China. “A portion [of luxury shoppers] will go back to the original pre-COVID overseas consumption,” Yan said. “But, I think the local [luxury market] will be also important for most of the brands.” – Rappler.com"

He said the SJDM police office would wait a bit “so that it will not hamper the solemnity of their grief.” The town police chief said they need to conduct evaluation and further investigation before deciding on whether to file any case against the father, whose son shot himself inside a school around 5:40 am on Wednesday. “But definitely the father himself has no participation (in the shooting),” Lamuctod said. The Bulacan provincial police’s initial report said the boy managed to get hold of the PNP-issued gun owned by his father and brought it to his school at the Benito Nieto Elementary School in their hometown. Lamuctod said the gun was a 9mm Pietro Beretta, which was kept inside the father’s cabinet. “Actually, the cabinet that the gun was put in by the father was secured,” the police chief told Rappler, citing reports from investigators. “Syempre anak mo yan, meron siyang access sa kwarto. (Of course, he’s your child, he could enter the room.) So the boy took the gun outside the residence and brought it to the school,” he added.

Police reports said that the students involved were also neighbors living in the same compound at Barangay Culiat, Quezon City. The child involved in conflict with the law is now under police custody. Students who witnessed the incident have received psychological first aid, according to the department. “We acknowledge the recent incidents involving violence in schools.

Countries around the world have faced rising energy costs in the face of a global surge in natural gas and heating fuel prices resulting from the conflict in Ukraine. Many South Korean households began to feel the impact in recent weeks after turning up the heat amid a cold spell, with monthly gas bills up 34% last month from a year ago, according to Statistics Korea. Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s top presidential economic secretary, said the increase in bills was inevitable, citing a near tenfold growth in global natural gas prices since 2021, but South Korean rates were still far lower than the levels in many other advanced countries. The measures would benefit almost 1.2 million families receiving energy vouchers and around 1.6 million homes eligible for the gas discount this winter, in a country of 21.6 million households, Choi said. “There is an inevitable aspect of realizing energy prices under these difficult external circumstances,” he told a briefing. “But we will make maximum policy efforts to minimize the burden on the people.” Many South Koreans expressed concerns over additional hikes in energy bills as freezing winter weather continued. “Our heating bills have gone up about 50% from previous years,” said Lim Jong-cheol, a Seoul resident who said he and his wife have fixed incomes and are trying to cut back on expenses like eating out. Bang Myung-soon, 76, who has been running a small hardware store in Seoul, said she was “shocked” by the hike in heating bills and government subsidies would not be enough. “At home, I wear many clothes, a hat, gloves, and anything that can keep me warm, but I can’t turn down the heat here because of customers,” she told Reuters from her store, sitting on a heated pad. “The government might have some policy to help people like us, but I have no hope.” The weather agency issued a heavy snow advisory on Thursday in the greater Seoul area and some eastern and central regions, prompting at least five flights to be called off and several national parks to shut down as of 11 am (0200 GMT), according to the interior ministry.

Strong Group will also be leaning on its young guns led by Fil-Am guard Sedrick Barefield, Jerom Lastimosa, Will Gozum, Justine Baltazar, and JD Cagulangan. Rounding out the crew are BJ Andrade, Francis Lopez, Migs Oczon, and Inand Fornillos. After UAE, the Philippines will go up against club teams from Libya, Syria, and Lebanon. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/look-back-dacer-corbito-murder-case/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – After 22 years of hiding, former Philippine National Police (PNP) officer William Reed, was arrested by the police in Pulilan, Bulacan on January 22, 2023. Reed was among the suspects in the Dacer-Corbito murder case that became sensational during the early 2000s. The former cop was part of the interior department’s list of most wanted, and carried a bounty of P250,000. And his arrest became the latest development in the 23-year-old case. Salvador “Buddy” Dacer is a known public relations man. He worked as a publicist for former president Joseph Estrada, while Emmanuel Corbito was Dacer’s driver. Before the two’s brutal death, Dacer was summoned in Malacañang by Estrada because he was accused of lobbying for the impeachment of the then-president. The two were abducted in Manila on November 24, 2000 and after they went missing for five months – in April 2001 – their burned remains were discovered in a creek in Indang, Cavite. The remains were discovered only after two of the suspects brought authorities to the scene. They recovered only fragments of bones and teeth from the area. Done by forensic pathologist Dr. Raquel Fortun, examinations positively identified the remains as belonging to Dacer and Corbito. Based on reports, the two were believed to be strangled by electric cord, burned, and were buried in the area. This happened several hours after they were snatched from their vehicle in the country’s capital. The double murder case was sensational because names of powerful politicians and officials at that time were implicated in the murders. Then top official, Estrada, was tagged because he summoned his publicist before Dacer went missing. Ampy, Dacer’s daughter, confirmed that he witnessed the former president raising his voice at her father. Another former president was also blamed. Estrada’s camp blamed the late former president Fidel V. Ramos, Estrada’s predecessor, for the murders because Dacer was about to meet Ramos at the Manila Hotel the day he and his driver were abducted. Former PNP chief and senator Panfilo Lacson was also implicated. The involvement of some agents of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) tainted Lacson’s name because he was the task force’s head at the time. The PAOCTF was later abolished through an executive order in April 2001. Also, Lacson was among Estrada’s favorite generals back then. On May 12, 2001, at least 22 people were charged by the Department of Justice before a Manila court for the murders. These included: Senior Police Officer 4 Marino Soberano, SPO3 Mauro Torres, SPO3 Jose Escalante, SPO4 Mario Sarmiento, SPO1 William Reed, SPO1 Ruperto Nemeno, Police Officer 2 Thomas Sarmiento, Crisostomo Purificacion, Digo de Pedro, Renato Malabanan, Margarito Cuenco, and Rommel Rollan. Others tagged were: Glen Dumlao, Vicente Arnado, Roberto Langcauon. In 2009, the Dacer family filed a complaint against Lacson, but the former senator was later cleared by the Court of Appeals in 2011. Meanwhile, in 2020, one of the former cops tagged in the case, Cezar Mancao II, was appointed by former president Rodrigo Duterte as head of the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center. Mancao, who used to be under the Witness Protection Program, testified against Estrada and Lacson during the trial. He later cleared the former president and PAOCTF chief. A two-part story written by journalist Aries Rufo for Newsbreak detailed the possible motives of the people implicated in the Dacer-Corbito case. Before Dacer went missing, he wrote to his close friend, retired General Jose Almonte, about the supposed threats to his life. In a letter published by Newsbreak, Dacer told the retired general that he wrote so that it cannot be recorded by Lacson or Estrada. Dacer, even though he worked for Estrada, had a turbulent relationship with the former president. In another letter dated June 9, 1999, Dacer listed down names of supposed people behind a demolition job against him. He named Lacson, who was at the time gunning for the post of PNP chief. Dacer, in a separate letter, even said Lacson was “manipulating” Estrada’s mind. Dacer also cautioned Estrada against appointing Lacson. The publicist said he was more in favor of Reynaldo Wycoco, who was the National Capital Region Police Office chief then. Court records also showed that it was the PAOCTF, which was behind the abduction of Dacer and Corbito. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/koji-sato-take-over-toyota-ceo-akio-toyoda/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – Toyota‘s chief executive will step down as head of the company his grandfather founded, the automaker said on Thursday, January 26, handing over to the leader of its Lexus luxury brand as the Japanese giant struggles to meet the shift to electric vehicles. The 53-year-old chief branding officer and president of Toyota Motor Corporation’s Lexus brand, Koji Sato, will take over from April 1 when Akio Toyoda becomes chairman, it said. The issue of who would take over the top spot at Toyota – Japan’s biggest company and one of the world’s most influential manufacturers – has been an increasing focus for investors. But the timing of the announcement was a surprise. Under the 66-year-old Toyoda, who led the company for more than a decade, the automaker has appeared reluctant to embrace electric vehicles, arguing the hybrid technology it pioneered with its once market-leading Prius was a better fit for many drivers. It also touted hydrogen-powered cars as the future, raising fears it would be left behind by the rise of electric vehicles, as the flashier and more nimble Tesla eclipsed it in both innovation and share price. That insistence on hybrids and hydrogen also prompted criticism from investors and environmental activists who once widely praised Toyota’s technology and emissions record. “No doubt Mr. Toyoda has been a competent CEO, but the whole auto sector needs to make disruptive change and Toyota has been lagging in this in our view, so this could be chance for a fresh start,” said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer of Danish pension fund AkademikerPension, which has repeatedly pressed Toyota to accelerate its shift to electric vehicles. “We are hopeful this could help Toyota to set a new direction, but it remains to be seen.” The succession announcement was broadcast on a webcast through the automaker’s Toyota Times channel in what looked more like a stilted talk show with a host rather than a formal corporate announcement. “The timing of this was a surprise,” said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, who noted there may have been a “sense of stagnation” inside the company given recent pressure on the share price. “Probably, the day-to-day management will not change. Having Akio Toyoda step away from being CEO may increase his symbolism within the company and it may be hard for the young, new president to really show his hand.” There was also little mention of concrete corporate strategy or investment priorities to come. Toyoda said Sato’s mission would be to transform Toyota into a “mobility company,” without specifying what that would entail. “The CEO needs youth, energy, strength,” Toyoda said, saying that he himself was now a “relic” of an older generation. In Sato, too, he said, he had chosen a fellow car aficionado. Toyoda described the hand-off as a “baton touch” in leadership, but the staged event highlighted his continued central role. He turned from time to time to offer instruction and reminders to Sato. Sato said Toyoda had offered him the CEO job at the end of the year when both were in Thailand for an event to celebrate Toyota’s 60th anniversary of operations there. “I didn’t know how to respond,” Sato recalled. “I thought it was a joke.” One Toyota executive, who asked not to be identified, said the automaker was headed for a period of “cloistered rule,” referring to the period in Japan’s history when a retired emperor continued to call the shots. During his more than a decade at the top, Toyoda presided over the carmaker during a period of intense change in the industry and rising uncertainty about how legacy automakers can fend off the challenge from newer challengers such as Tesla. Toyoda, speaking at a news conference, said his term at the helm of Toyota started in 2009 with “crisis after crisis” from the effects of a global recession, to Toyota’s recalls and safety crisis to the disruptions that followed the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. At a shareholder meeting in June last year, Toyoda said he was “thinking about timing and the selection of a successor” when asked about his future. On Thursday, he said Sato was chosen because he “worked hard” to learn Toyota’s philosophy. Sato started his career at Toyota in 1992, before rising through the ranks to become chief engineer of Lexus International, a luxury auto brand of Toyota, in 2016, according to his profile on the company’s website. He has held positions as the president of Lexus International and Gazoo Racing Company, Toyota’s motorsport brand, since 2020. He also took on an executive role at Toyota and became its chief branding officer in January 2021. Philip Craven, a Toyota director, said in a recorded video statement that the board had reviewed and approved the succession plan put forward by Toyoda and the outgoing chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/bal-david-resigns-ust-tigers-coach/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Bal David parted ways with the UST Growling Tigers following an ill-fated UAAP campaign. According to a report by The Varsitarian, the official student publication of the University of Santo Tomas, David resigned from his post as head coach on Thursday, January 26, after mentoring the Tigers for just one UAAP season. Under David, UST finished last in Season 85 with a 1-13 record. The Tigers showed promise at the start of the tournament as they toppled the Adamson Soaring Falcons in their opening game before they lost all of their remaining matches to end up at the bottom of the eight-team league. David, a former PBA standout who helped the Tigers win two of four straight UAAP titles in 1994 and 1995, handled a young UST team led by standout Nic Cabanero. It did not help the Tigers’ cause when veteran gunner Sherwin Concepcion got ruled out of the season due to the age limit and rookie guard Kean Baclaan left the team to join the NU Bulldogs. The Tigers have been on a downward spiral since the Sorsogon bubble mess, which saw the departure of key players CJ Cansino, Brent Paraiso, and former UAAP MVP Soulemane Chabi Yo. Cansino and Paraiso won collegiate championships with the UP Fighting Maroons and the Letran Knights, respectively, while Chabi Yo took his talents to Europe. UST racked up a 4-24 record over the past two seasons, a significant drop in performance after reaching the finals in Season 82 with Aldin Ayo calling the shots. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-mayor-rama-sued-nepotism-january-2023/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – Cebu City resident Jonel Saceda filed administrative and criminal complaints of nepotism against Mayor Mike Rama on Tuesday, January 24 before the Office of the Ombudsman in Central Visayas. Saceda’s nine-page complaint-affidavit claimed that after Rama married Malou Jimenez Mandanat on October 28, 2021, he appointed two of her brothers into government positions. “Respondent Mayor Rama appointed his brother-in-law, Elmer Gimenez Mandanat as Process Server under the Office of the Mayor for the period January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022…Rama appointed his other brother-in-law, Gomer Gimenez Mandanat as Administrative Aide III (Laborer II) under the Cebu City Medical Center for the period January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022,” his complaint said. Saceda noted that the city’s plantilla of casual appointments, and birth certificates showed that Elmer and Gomer are indeed brothers of the mayor’s wife. They were appointed for a second time between July 1, 2022, and December 30, 2022, his complaint added. “The subject appointments of Elmer Gimenez Mandanat and Gomer Gimenez Mandanat by Respondent Mayor Rama to a non-confidential position in the Cebu City Government are clearly prohibited nepotic appointments,” the complaint read. Section 79 of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 states that no person shall be appointed in the career service of the local government if they are related within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity to the appointing or recommending authority. In defense of Rama, the mayor’s executive secretary Collin Rosell told Rappler that the case filed against the mayor was “malicious.” Rosell said the mayor’s brothers-in-law were already working for the city government before his marriage to Malou. “If we’re talking about the brothers, what we can say is that they have been working in the city hall since 2015 and the renewal of their contract follows a process that is being handled by our Human Resources department…it all goes through a long process,” Rosell said. The lawyer added that they have yet to receive any documents regarding the matter but will respond the soonest time possible. The 67-year-old Rama’s first marriage to lawyer Araceli Lim Francisco was annulled in 2000. Saceda said the mayor ought to be preventively suspended pending investigation and be held liable for grave misconduct and graft. “Walay taw nagpaluyo nako (No one is manipulating me) and I had (the document) even notarized at the Department of Justice. This is just our role in nation-building so we have to be very vigilant,” Saceda told Rappler in a phone interview on Thursday, January 26. Rappler has contacted Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama to comment on the matter but has yet to receive a reply. This story will be updated immediately after the mayor sends his statement. –Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/how-ofws-trafficked-crypto-scam-operations/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – Possibly dozens of Filipinos who looked to provide for their families with jobs abroad have been duped into working for a scam. In a November 2022 privilege speech, Senator Risa Hontiveros exposed a case of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were trafficked into Myanmar after being recruited as call center agents or workers for Philippine offshore gaming operators through various social media platforms. Once they got there, they were forced allegedly by a Chinese mafia to engage in a cryptocurrency scam. Failure to scam people meant salary cuts or physical abuse. On January 18, Hontiveros exposed another case of OFWs brought to Cambodia to perform the same exact crypto scam. The reports have prompted the Senate to investigate, starting with a committee hearing on Wednesday, January 25. Here’s what we know so far. According to Hontiveros, the OFWs were offered positions of customer service representatives, chat support agents, or data encoders at call centers. An OFW only known as “Ron,” who spoke at the January 25 hearing, said he talked with his reportedly Malaysian recruiter online after being introduced by a childhood friend in April 2022. Hontiveros has posted warnings on her social media account about what social media job postings for the crypto scam looked like. Ron, once in Phnom Penh, was made to sign a contract that had a job description of befriending people on a dating app and convincing them to invest in cryptocurrencies. “I did not want to sign the contract, but if I were to return to the Philippines, I would have needed to pay for all of the expenses my recruiter shouldered for me. It amounted to $1,700, and I would have to pay for my flight back, too. Because I could not pay, I felt I had no choice but to sign it,” Ron said in Filipino. Ron said that he was trained by other Filipinos who had learned to scam, but the team leaders who gave instructions were Chinese. He observed around 50 employees in the office, of whom around “90%” were Filipinos. The Filipinos used various social media and messaging apps to connect with potential scam victims. These included Facebook, LinkedIn, Tinder, Wink, TextNow, and MeetMe. One of the OFWs who communicated with Hontiveros’ office, “Rita,” said her group in the Myanmar office centered on LinkedIn, since professionals can be found there. Their targets were mostly well-off, lonely individuals from the United States or Canada. They created fake profiles, with characters packaged as female elites working as managers or higher positions. One character was “Claudine Wong,” a marketing manager at Accenture who graduated from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business. “Claudine’s” profile also said she had “over 10 years of career in business management, team leadership, and customer service with Fortune 500 companies.” Rita said her group posed as someone they worked with at the office. What made the scam more believable was how that person was available whenever the victim wanted to engage in a video call. The Filipinos’ job was to chat with them, when a face was not required. “Kami po ‘yung nakikipag-communicate, kukunin namin ‘yung loob nila, kailangan magtiwala sila sa ‘min. Pagkatapos po noon, pag feeling namin nagtitiwala na sila sa ‘min, yayayain na po namin silang mag-invest sa cryptocurrency,” said Rita. (We are the ones who communicate, we befriend them, and they need to trust us. After that, once we feel that they trust us, we invite them to invest in cryptocurrency.) The scammers befriend their victims by talking about topics designated by their employers – from travel, to music, to sports, and eventually to crypto research as something they do in their free time. They also had to sustain sexual and romantic “relationships” with their victims. According to Rita, the invitation to invest only commences once the Filipinos and the scam victims are able to transfer to WhatsApp or Telegram, which are encrypted messaging apps. Rita said they needed to transfer their chats to these apps, as their fake accounts could get banned on social media. The crypto platforms the Filipinos used include Crypto.com, Coinbase, and Kraken, which are legitimate cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The scammers then convince the victims to bet their crypto from the three legitimate platforms on a “trading platform” called “Link.” Once the crypto is stored in Link, Rita said the Chinese have control over it. Withdrawals can only happen with prior approval. The scammers usually allow first attempts to withdraw to convince their victims that withdrawing is possible. But succeeding attempts, especially those with investments that have grown significantly, are no longer allowed. For the trafficked workers, failure to scam meant abuse, or even death. According to “Miles,” one of the OFWs who was trafficked to Cambodia, she and her group were made to work up to 16 hours, seven days a week, especially if they could not get people to scam. Ron said that his $800-salary was cut when he was unsuccessful in finding people to scam. Ron and Miles witnessed their co-workers get electrocuted by their employers. Hontiveros said in her privilege speech that forms of abuse included being forced to do 1,000 squats, carrying heavy pails of water, being hit by an electric baton, and even being stabbed to death. In the November report, 12 Filipinos were rescued from Myanmar by a network of nongovernmental organizations, while the group of Filipinos in Cambodia was rescued after an intervention from the Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh. The January 25 Senate hearing revealed that at least one Filipino was given genuine travel documents by Philippine authorities to go and work for a bogus opportunity in Cambodia. Ron was allowed to take a pre-departure orientation seminar required by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and was issued a certificate of attendance. He was also given an overseas employment certificate (OEC), clearing him to be an “interior designer” in Cambodia, despite his understanding that he was going to work as a call center agent. The Cambodian embassy in the Philippines also approved his request for a work visa, Ron said. Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Undersecretary Bernard Olalia admitted to Ron’s pre-departure orientation certificate and OEC being authentic. He added that the two “lines of defense” – the Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh and the DMW – that were meant to verify employment failed to detect that Ron was going to work for a scam operation. Other Filipinos used fake travel documents, according to Rita. Ron told the Senate that he had personal knowledge of Bureau of Immigration (BI) officials being involved in allowing Filipinos to get cleared through the Clark International Airport (CIA). Rita, who worked in Myanmar, said that outbound Filipinos were instructed to give P10,000 to P20,000 ($183 to $366) to immigration officials. Miles, meanwhile, spoke of an “escort” from Philippine immigration that allowed them easy travel. On January 17, BI Commissioner Norman Tansingco relieved two of the BI’s personnel following reports of their alleged involvement in trafficking activities at the ClA, and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Tansingco said in the January 25 hearing that they relieved a certain Alma Grace David as the immigration officer who allegedly escorted at least three trafficked OFWs. The victims claimed that their recruiter was in cahoots with the officer. Victims in the hearing also recounted the use of fake airport passes and immigration stamps. With the guidance of their recruiter, some OFWs avoided formal ports and used backdoor exits, particularly via boat, in porous borders in the south. One OFW recounted transiting through Sabah, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Thailand, and then reaching Cambodia as his final destination. “We will not tolerate any such misdemeanor amongst our ranks…. The fight against trafficking is a huge undertaking, and we have long been raising that this should be tackled using a whole-of-government approach. We have to take it from its roots, and pull out this weed that destroys the lives of our kababayan,” said Tansingco in a statement the same day at the Senate hearing. Philippine immigration has been under fire for alleged inward and outbound bribery. Previously, the BI was called to the Senate for the “pastillas scam,” where immigration officers would accept bribes to allow Chinese tourists to overstay in the Philippines and work in Philippine offshore gaming operators. In Myanmar, the Filipinos worked in an area called the Shwe Kokko Special Economic Zone, also known as Yatai New City. It is a $15-billion development owned by Yatai International Holdings Group in Myawaddy town, which sits on the Myanmar border with Thailand. The experience of the OFWs was only one of many human trafficking incidents reported in the economic hub. Various news reports and analyses of think tanks say that a Chinese mafia is evading Beijing’s regulations on online gambling and cryptocurrency scams by operating in places in Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The operations initially employed Chinese workers, but when the pandemic struck, the mafia trafficked people from Southeast Asia and Africa to replace the Chinese. Consul general Emma Sarne of the Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh in the January 25 hearing attested to an increase of Filipinos being trafficked to the kingdom to work in online scams. The scammers used to recruit Filipinos who were already in Cambodia, but when the kingdom began loosening travel restrictions during the pandemic, OFWs began coming in as tourists. They availed of visa-free entry for Association of Southeast Asian Nations member-states. Sarne also said that the scammers would use the names of legitimate companies without their knowledge, and forge documents and signatures of officials like herself. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), reports of Filipinos being trafficked into cryptocurrency scams and online gambling operations are found in other parts of Southeast Asia – not just Cambodia and Myanmar. The DFA and DMW have acknowledged the urgency of putting up Migrant Workers Offices in more areas across Southeast Asia. – with reports from Ralf Rivas/Rappler.com USD $1 = P54.63"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-council-fails-override-rama-veto-ordinance-granting-probe-powers/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – The author of an ordinance giving the Cebu City council powers to conduct investigations and issue subpoenas for persons involved in these inquiries failed on Wednesday, January 25, to muster an override of Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama’s veto. Rama vetoed on January 19 City Ordinance No. 2673 Series of 2022,  “An Ordinance Granting The Sangguniang Panglungsod Of The City Of Cebu To Conduct Inquiries In Aid Of Legislation, Issue Subpoena Ad Testificandum And Duces Tecum, And Charge For Contempt Any Person Who Refuses To Obey Such Process.” His veto message said the measure went beyond the powers of the legislative arm and would be prejudicial to public welfare. “Although I fully understand the intention of the Sangguniang Panglungsod, however, I am constrained to exercise my veto power, as vested in me by the Local Government Code of 1991 and Republic Act No. 3857 or An Act to Revise the Charter of the City of Cebu,” Rama wrote in a letter addressed to Cebu City Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia. “We, as public servants, are strictly bound to observe the parameters laid out in the Constitution on the right of any and all persons—one of which is the right against self-incrimination,” Rama stressed. The author of the measure, Councilor Mary Ann De Los Santos of the Bando Osmeña – Pundok Kauswagan (BOPK) responded to Rama’s decision on Wednesday, January 25. While the mayor quoted RA No. 3857, he “refused” to apply Section 14 of the same law of RA 3857, De Los Santos said. The provision reads: “The City Council or the Mayor, or any person or committee authorized by either of them, shall have the power to inquire the official conduct of any department, agency, or officer or employee of the city and to make an investigation as to city affairs, and for that purposes may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and compel the production of books, papers, and other evidence.” However, De Los Santos’ move to override Rama’s veto got support from only two councilors,  Nestor Archival and Joy Young. Twelve councilors abstained, while three others were absent. De Los Santos told Rappler in a phone interview on Thursday. January 26, that her intention was to supplement the “spirit of that law.” The councilor rebutted the mayor’s argument that the landmark ordinance would be prejudicial to the public. She explained that an investigation would be more of an inquiry and not create a situation that would incriminate “speakers” “Under Section 10, paragraph of the proposed ordinance, all statements, and testimonies given by the witness during the investigation are considered privileged communication,” De Los Santos told Rappler. Privileged communication refers to all information exchanged between parties that are considered private, protected, and cannot be used against any individual. “In this ordinance, we are not the one who will mete out the penalty but the courts,” the councilor added. “We go to court to seek redress for a defiance to its lawfully-issued subpoena.” Two-thirds of the majority is required to push the override. De Los Santos reminded council colleagues of the anomalous transactions on the city’s garbage collection that then-Vice Mayor Rama pursued and ordered the National Bureau of Investigation in Central Visayas (NBI-7) to investigate. On December 15, 2022, NBI-7 Regional Director Rennan Oliva announced that eight Cebu City officials allegedly conspired with a private construction company in transactions involving city garbage collection. “The inquiry came from the council. The supposed investigation was in aid of legislation in order to protect the public as well as government funds,” De Los Santos said. But the council was unable to fully investigate the matter because of limitations like the non-appearance of resource speakers and inadequate documentation, she pointed out. “We are tasked with local laws but we don’t have effective powers to oversee and investigate, which are supposed to be inherent in any legislative body, be it local or national,” De Los Santos added. Rama’s veto, she warned, would mean a council with almost no power to probe matters of public interest. University of the Philippines law professor Lawyer Amando Virgil Ligutan, who lawyers for BOPK and former Mayor Tommy Osmeña, told Rappler that the decision to veto the ordinance was lamentable. “For a mayor of a city plagued by issues of massive corruption to veto an ordinance intended to curb that corruption is unimaginable. Why fear that ordinance when you have nothing to hide,” Ligutan said. When asked whether or not the proposed ordinance was lawful, Ligutan confirmed that the ordinance was based on the Revised Charter of Cebu City and that the implementation of its coercive powers was consistent with current laws. “Only those who have evil designs will not approve of it,” the high-profile lawyer said. –Rappler.com"

Williams topped the scoring duel between the two imports with 46 points, but Franklin claimed the victory behind his near triple-double performance as the FiberXers seized an early lead in the standings with a 2-0 record. Living up to his billing as a former NBA player, Franklin chalked up 42 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists in his sensational PBA debut after coming in as a replacement for Ethan Rusbatch. While Franklin did most of the heavy lifting, it was the locals who turned things around for Converge, with forward Jeron Teng and rookie big man Justin Arana taking charge in their third-quarter comeback. The Dyip still led 75-68 early in the third period before Teng and Arana scored 8 and 7 points, respectively, in a pivotal 26-7 run that opened a 94-82 advantage for the FiberXers with under four minutes in the quarter. Arana and Teng both finished with 15 points and 6 rebounds, Maverick Ahanmisi had 16 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 steals, Abu Tratter tallied 10 points and 9 rebounds, while Alec Stockton produced 10 points and 3 steals. While Converge cruised in the fourth frame on the way to the 15-point rout, the win left much to be desired for head coach Aldin Ayo, especially after Williams put on a scoring clinic in the first half. Also debuting in the PBA like Franklin, Williams erupted for 30 first-half points as Terrafirma entered the break with a 71-68 lead. “It felt like an All-Star Game. We need to work on our defense,” Ayo said in a mix of Filipino and English. “Our objective is to improve on defense.” Juami Tiongson backstopped Williams with 18 points on top of 4 rebounds and 4 steals in the loss that marked the third straight for the Dyip dating back to last conference.

The San Miguel big man averaged 28.9 statistical points (SPs) built on season averages of 18.5 points, 13.6 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.3 blocks to edge Barangay Ginebra star Scottie Thompson and Beermen teammate CJ Perez. Reigning MVP Thompson came in at second place with 24.9 SPs, while Perez wound up at third place with 24.6 SPs. Fajardo started the season on a roll as he led the Beermen to the Philippine Cup championship, clinching his ninth Best Player of the Conference (BPC) crown and his fourth Finals MVP plum along the way. Although Fajardo missed a huge chunk of the Commissioner’s Cup after undergoing surgery for his throat, he still anchored San Miguel to the semifinals before they fell prey to guest team Bay Area. Meanwhile, Thompson claimed the BPC honors in the Commissioner’s Cup and captured his seventh PBA title with the Gin Kings as they outlasted the Dragons in the best-of-seven finals that went the distance. Thompson averaged 13.8 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.8 steals in 39 games this season.

According to Hong Kong police in a Wednesday, January 25 statement, the officer believed his life was in danger. The 43-year-old Filipino allegedly grabbed the cop by the neck and pushed him down a flight of stairs. Hong Kong radio station RTHK reported that police said the man appeared to be drunk. The police statement did not mention the suspect’s nationality. “When police officers sped to scene and conducted investigation, a foreign man suddenly turned emotional, suspectedly assaulted a male police officer with hands, pushed him down the stairs, chased him, and attempted to assault him again. Facing threats to life, the male police officer gave verbal warnings to the foreign man but in vain and subsequently fired three shots at him,” the police said. The policeman shot the Filipino in the abdomen and arm. The police said the victim was conscious when he was airlifted to the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan. Philippine consul general in Hong Kong Raly Tejada told Rappler on Thursday, January 26, that the wounded Filipino underwent a successful surgery. “Our foremost concern is the well being of the wounded Filipino national whom we understand underwent a successful surgery. We wish him a speedy recovery,” said Tejada. The police report also mentioned that another “foreign” 33-year-old man was arrested for assaulting police and obstructing their duty in the incident. Hong Kong media reported that this man was also Filipino. Tejada, however, said that there were “other Filipinos” being investigated in connection with the incident, but they were not arrested. Asked if the consulate would be ready to provide legal assistance as well, should the Filipinos be sued, Tejada said, “The Philippine government is ready to render assistance to our kababayan.” Tejada said that the Philippine consulate in Hong Kong is coordinating closely with Hong Kong authorities, and expect to receive a full report “soon.” The consulate is also in touch with his family, on standby to help if needed. Hong Kong police had defended the cop’s decision to open fire. “After an initial probe, we feel that the colleague may indeed feel his life was under threat, and he may be seriously wounded. It was suitable for him to use his gun,” RTHK quoted Au Yeung Ki, an acting marine police superintendent, as saying. A report from the Hong Kong Free Press said that it is rare for Hong Kong police to use live ammunition, more so on the quiet, outlying island of Peng Chau. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/things-to-know-jesus-durante/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Former Presidential Security Group (PSG) head Brigadier General Jesus Durante III and Colonel Michael Licyayo were taken into custody by the Philippine Army on Thursday, January 26. Durante, Licyayo, other military personnel, and a civilian are persons of interest in the murder of businesswoman-model Yvonette Chua Plaza on December 29, 2022. Philippine National Police (PNP) director of the Davao region Brigadier General Benjamin Silo Jr. said that the act “was a crime of passion,” and that they are continuing to build evidence for the case. A Davao native, Durante is a graduate of the Philippine Science High School (Main Campus, 1988), and Philippine Military Academy Tanglaw Diwa Class of 1992. He holds a master’s degree in defense analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School in California, United States, and a master’s in public management, majoring in development security from the Development Academy of the Philippines. A “full-blooded Scout Ranger,” Durante commanded the 2nd Scout Ranger Battalion of the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment based in Mindanao. He received the PMA Alumni Association’s Cavalier Award for Army Operations in 2003. He was also a military observer in the 2007 United Nations mission in Wau, South Sudan. Durante was appointed PSG commander during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term on February 24, 2020. Prior to his appointment, he was the commanding officer of the PSG’s Presidential Escorts Battalion, providing immediate security to the president and other VIPs. (READ: ‘Full-blooded Scout Ranger’ Jesus Durante is new PSG commander) Durante claimed responsibility in December 2020 for the unauthorized use of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine was administered to personnel who served as close-in security for Duterte. (READ: PSG chief: ‘I take full responsibility’ for unregistered vaccine use) Then-senator minority leader Franklin Drilon called for Durante to be summoned to explain the unauthorized use of the vaccine. Drilon later said that it was no longer necessary to invite Durante, according to an Inquirer.net article. In August 2021, Randolph Cabangbang replaced Durante as PSG chief. Durante was then designated as commander of the 101st Infantry Brigade in Davao de Oro. According to Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Romeo Brawner Jr., both civil and military investigations against Durante and company will proceed at the same time. He said that the military will respect judicial proceedings for Durante and other army officers. Brawner added that investigations will continue to determine if the officers under Durante acted under orders to carry out the alleged murder. – Rappler.com"

A junta spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. Myanmar’s economy has declined since the coup, with the kyat currency plummeting against the dollar and food and fuel prices spiralling upwards. “Without alternatives and economic stability it is likely that opium cultivation and production will continue to expand,” warned UNODC Myanmar country manager Benedikt Hofmann. The cultivated area in 2022 expanded by a third to 40,100 hectares (99,000 acres), while the average estimated yield rose 41% to nearly 20 kg (44 lb) per hectare, the highest value since the UNODC started keeping records in 2002, the report said. The eastern Shan State, which borders China, Thailand and Laos, saw the biggest increase in cultivation, at 39%. The 2021 report primarily used satellite data to determine cultivated area. The value of opium produced annually in Myanmar can reach up to $2 billion, with much of the drug smuggled out to neighboring countries and on to the global market, the report added. – Rappler.com"

Emma Girao Togoto welcomed her biological sister, 67-year-old Elizabeth Girao, who spent 32 years away from home. City social workers took in Girao in 2020 after she was found wandering on the city streets at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. They housed her in Bahay Pagasa (House of Hope) until the new Bale Pusu (House of Heart) opened in September 2021. Mayor Carmelo Lazatin, Jr considers Bale Pusu a flagship program, the first city-operated home for the female homeless elderly. Part of the city program is trying to reconnect residents of Bale Pusu with their families. Lazatin facilitated the search for Elizabeth’s family. City Social Welfare and Development Office head Edna Duaso and Bale Pusu social worker Jerramae Tolentiono escorted Elizabth to Makato. Makato Mayor Ramon Anselmo Martin Legaspi III and Municipality Social Welfare and Development Officer Bernadith Andrade also joined their reunion. “Mayor Pogi, maraming salamat po sa pagtulong mo sa akin at pag-rescue mo. Mabuti na lang at mayroong Mayor na sumagip at tumulong sa akin, kasi hindi ko alam noon kung saan ako titira,” said Girao after her one year and four-month stay in Bale Pusu. “Hindi mo ako pinabayaan at dahil sa inyong ginintuang puso pinahalagahan mo kaming nangangailangan ng iyong pagkalinga.” (Mayor Pogi, thank you for rescuing me. I am lucky there was a mayor who helped me as I didn’t know where to shelter. You did not abandon me and your golden heart ensured that we who needed help received care.) Lazatin handed over P5,000 from his personal salary to Girao to help her start her life in Aklan. Lazatin’s chief adviser IC Calaguas and executive assistant IV Reina Manuel also gave P5,000 to aid Girao. “Hangad ng city government na mapabuti ang kalagayan at kapakanan ng lahat ng naninirahan sa siyudad. Kaya naman pinapaigting natin ang mga ganitong programa, para mas marami tayong matulungan,” Lazatin said.

Bakit kailangang i-fact-check: Ang video na naglalaman ng sabi-sabi ay mayroong 204,000 na view sa YouTube at laman din ng ilang post sa Facebook. Taong 2022 pa nang magsimulang ipalaganap ang mga sabi-sabing papalitan na raw ang pangalan ng nasabing paliparan. Ang katotohanan: Walang sinabi si Pangulong Marcos na papalitan na ang pangalan ng NAIA at gagawin itong MIA. Ginamit sa mapanlinlang na video ang clip mula sa pahayag ng Pangulo noong Enero 23 sa Malacañang kung saan sinabi niyang walang plano ang kanyang administrasyong isapribado ang nasabing paliparan. Nilinaw niyang hindi maaaring isapribado ang isang paliparan. Tinitingnan daw ng kanyang administrasyon ang posibilidad na ipahawak ang pamamahala ng operasyon ng paliparan sa pribadong sektor. Ito ay mangyayari sa pamamagitan ng isang “management contract.” Layunin nitong ibsan ang traffic congestion sa nasabing paliparan. Sa mga naunang fact check ng Rappler ay nilinaw nang kinakailangan ng panibagong batas kung papalitan ang pangalan ng NAIA dahil ipinangalan ito sa dating senador na si Ninoy Aquino sa bisa ng Republic Act  6639.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/bir-crackdown-iligan-illicit-cigarette-traders/,[],"ILIGAN, Philippines – The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on Wednesday, January 25, began a crackdown on the illicit cigarette trade in Iligan City, where the sale of smuggled cigarettes has become commonplace. Nena Juntong, the owner of one of the stores selling illicit cigarettes in Barangay Suarez, Iligan City, was among those caught. She admitted to knowing that the items were illegal but said she took the risk because all the stores around her were also selling them. “I knew that the cigarettes I was selling were illegal, but I saw it everywhere, in the market and on the streets, so it seemed like the norm, and I followed the crowd to earn extra income,” Juntong admitted. The BIR estimated that one small store alone yielded more than P100,000 worth of illicit cigarettes, mostly with brand names that were unfamiliar a few years back. The cigarettes seized from stores were packaged as Cannon, Modern, Billionaire, San Marino, Delta, Maverick, Mighty, and Marlboro Gold, which authorities said were likely counterfeit. The government is losing some P50 billion to P100 billion in tax revenues annually due to the illicit cigarette trade, and BIR regional director Emir Abutazil issued a stark warning to illegal cigarette sellers in Iligan and its neighboring areas. He said their actions not only undermine the law but also cost the government much-needed revenue for basic services, including health programs. On Wednesday alone, authorities raided 13 retail stores in the villages of Suarez and Tibanga that were selling illicit cigarettes on January 25. The raids followed covert operations to identify Iligan stores engaged in illicit cigarette sales in violation of BIR rules and regulations. The boxes of confiscated cigarettes were brought to the BIR regional office in Cagayan de Oro City for inventory. Officials said these would all be destroyed. Abutazil said there were more illicit cigarette dealers and the BIR would carry on with its campaign in the region to increase its annual collections by 25% to 35%. “Reducing the sale of illicit cigarettes will help us achieve this goal,” said Jamalodin Guro, assistant chief of the BIR’s Regional Investigation Division. BIR-Iligan Revenue District officer Amanoding Esmail said authorities welcome useful information from concerned citizens to identify the distributors and manufacturers of illicit cigarettes. Guro said investigators noted that illicit cigarettes were in packs either without strips stamps or with fake stamps that are unreadable using BIR equipment. “If the stamp is blurry, that is Korean- or China-made,” Guro said. The BIR said authorities would carry out more operations against illicit cigarette traders, and those found violating the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 would be charged. Violators, officials said, could be charged with violation of minimum price rules, unlawful business, possession of spurious BIR stamps, tax evasion, and failure to issue receipts. – Rappler.com"

Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) provincial director Orly Cabaobao said heavy rain, which had been pounding parts of the province since Wednesday, January 25, caused flooding and landslides. The state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued an advisory at 11 am on Thursday warning of a low-pressure area (LPA) that could cause downpours of up to 75,000 drums per square kilometer in parts of Camiguin Island, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and the Dinagat Islands. PAGASA, however, also warned that inclement weather would be experienced across several regions in Mindanao. Mati City Mayor Michelle Rabat and eight other mayors in Davao Oriental issued executive orders suspending classes from Thursday to Friday, January 26 to 27, as a precautionary measure. Aside from Mati City, classes were also suspended in the Davao Oriental towns of Caraga, Baganga, Manay, Banaybanay, Governor Generoso, San Isidro, Cateel, and Lupon. Davao Oriental Governor Corazon Malanyaon sounded alarm bells as PAGASA raised the “yellow warning” over the province as early as Wednesday. The province has started seeing widespread flooding. For instance, the Davao Oriental Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office said flood waters hit the village of Mahan-ub in the coastal town of Baganga on Wednesday. The Coast Guard and the Baganga Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office deployed rescuers to help stranded villagers cross a swollen river. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) warned of an imminent landslide in the village of Dadong in the town of Tarragona in Davao Oriental. Phivolcs said a community in Tarragona was facing the risk of being buried in a landslide unless the heavy rain stopped, and advised local officials to prepare to evacuate families. PAGASA said moderate with occasionally heavy rain was being experienced over Agusan del Norte, Davao Occidental, Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte, and Agusan del Sur as of posting time. It also forecast light to moderate rain in some areas in Agusan del Norte, Davao Oriental, Sarangani, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga del Norte, Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, Misamis Oriental, Cotabato, and Surigao del Norte. Meanwhile, all classes in public schools in the Caraga region’s provinces of Surigao del Norte, Surigao City, and Siargao Islands were suspended by the Department of Education (DepEd) due to bad weather, said Gilbert Gonzales, the head for operations the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office.– Rappler.com"

(Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story referred to PayMongo as a unicorn. This has been corrected.) Malolos takes over the role of Isabel Ridad, who served as interim CEO. Ridad will stay until the end of February for the transition period, but will eventually depart the company to pursue “her own venture,” according to PayMongo. Malolos has a background in venture capital and banking. He previously served as president and CEO of JG Digital Equity Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Gokongwei group of companies. He also previously headed Data Analytics Ventures, the group’s data company that manages loyalty programs. Malolos is also co-founder and chairman of GoTyme Bank and served as CEO of Wing Bank, a digital finance service provider in Cambodia and of Maya. He also had stints with Mastercard Financial Services in Latin America and Cignifi Boston, which brought credit scoring innovations to African emerging markets. Malolos takes on the role as the startup enters a scale-up period amid a challenging market environment in the fintech space. “The Board of Directors has confidence in Jojo’s experience and his ability to effect and manage change as he brings significant experience in [mergers and acquisitions], organizational transformation, and a track record in the fintech, venture capital, digital banking, and innovation ecosystems,” PayMongo said. Malolos also leads PayMongo after a series of news reports claimed former CEO Francis Plaza allegedly made indecent proposals to a former employee. A Tech in Asia report detailed that Plaza allegedly offered an employee the position of human resources head in exchange for being in a romantic relationship with him. Plaza went on voluntary leave, but eventually left the company to “pursue other ventures.” He had denied the allegations. Co-founder Luis Sia appointed an independent third party to probe the incident, then eventually quit as PayMongo’s chief commercial officer. Prior to Plaza’s departure, he fired PayMongo chief finance officer Jay Olos following multiple reports of harassment from employees. The Tech in Asia report also brought up Plaza’s lavish spending, including purchases of watches and luxury cars, amid the company failing to hit targets. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/elon-musk-outlines-tesla-recession-playbook/,[],"Elon Musk has a playbook for Tesla headed into what he believes will be a “serious” recession: cut costs on everything from parts to logistics, while keeping the pressure on competitors with discounted sticker prices. In a conference call to discuss Tesla’s fourth-quarter results, Musk and other executives outlined plans to reshape the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s cost base after slashing prices up to 20%, a move some analysts see as the first shot in a price war. Part of the plan is expanding production at Tesla’s newest plants in Berlin and Austin, Texas and increasing the company’s in-house production of batteries, since scale yields savings, executives said. But Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said the company would also be “attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.” That would mean running Tesla factories leaner with fewer materials in inventory, cutting shipping and logistics costs and negotiating lower prices for components, he said – putting Tesla’s suppliers on notice. Among its suppliers, Tesla buys batteries from Japan’s Panasonic and China’s CATL, and sources the massive presses it has used to take cost and complexity out of production from Italy’s IDRA Group. Tesla is also cutting costs by redesigning elements of battery and electric motor systems, removing features that owners are not using, based on data collected from Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs on the road, the company said. Bill Russo, founder of China-based consultancy Automobility, said Tesla had already made gains on cost competitiveness by driving simplified hardware designs for its electric vehicles, taking a page from consumer electronics manufacturers. “You can offset some of the margin hit from pricing with massive scale and simpler electronic architecture,” Russo said. “This is how they are trying to win the game. Meanwhile the cost of lithium in EV batteries – the single most expensive component – will be higher in 2023 than last year, Kirkhorn said, a pressure that will hit Tesla’s rivals that are still losing money on EVs harder. “My guess is if the recession is a serious one, and I think it probably will be but I hope it isn’t, that would lead to meaningful decrease in almost all of our input costs,” Musk said. “So we expect to see deflation in our input costs, which would likely then lead to, yes, better margin.” Tesla said on Tuesday, January 24, it would invest more than $3.6 billion to expand its Nevada factory complex and to increase the output of battery cells so that it could produce enough there to power 2 million vehicles annually. Tesla forecast it would sell 1.8 million EVs this year, which would mean sales growth of about 37%. That annual number could be as high as 2 million vehicles barring an external shock, Musk said. Tesla made an average profit of almost $9,100 per vehicle sold in the fourth quarter, down 6% from a quarter earlier but still far more than established competitors. Tesla’s third-quarter profit per car sold was more than seven times higher than Toyota Motor Corporation, for example. Tesla slashed prices by as much as 20% earlier this month, a move that broadened the range of its line-up that qualifies for tax credits of $7,500 per vehicle in the United States. But analysts have focused on how well Tesla can sustain a core measure of profitability, the gross margin on auto sales, excluding credits. Kirkhorn said Tesla expected to see that metric above 20% for 2023 with the average price of its vehicles above $47,000 even after discounts. By comparison, the average price of a new vehicle was just over $49,500 in the US market in December, according to Kelley Blue Book. Bringing costs down is also key to the next phase of Tesla’s expansion, which Musk hinted the company would detail at its investor day in March: plans for an affordable EV that analysts have expected to be priced below $35,000. Tesla is also planning to roll out a revamped version of the Model 3 sedan later this year code-named “Highland” with a focus in part on reduced production cost, Reuters has reported. The company’s average cost per vehicle, including all categories of its spending, was almost $44,000 in the fourth quarter. “Price really matters. I think there’s just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla but can’t afford it,” Musk said. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/kids-cause-suffering-parents-unhappy/,[],"Some influential studies show that the decision to have kids leads to greater suffering — at least for parents. A famous study by Nobel prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and collaborators showed that working women experienced more negative, and less positive, emotions while caring for kids than while engaged in almost any other activity (except cleaning the bathroom). Subsequent research has shown that the effect is mediated by factors such as wealth and social support, but the central point remains. Even in the most favorable circumstances, having kids is a less than optimal way to maximize the overall amount of pleasure and enjoyment in your life. Such findings have been interpreted in popular and scholarly discussions as implying that kids are not a great source of happiness. In his New York Times bestselling book, Stumbling on Happiness, leading Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert claims findings like Kahneman’s reveal that the idea that “children bring happiness” is a false “super-replicator”: a cultural myth designed to keep unsuspecting parents passing on their genes, even though it makes them miserable. The tagline on Gilbert’s book reads “Think you know what makes you happy?” Well, think again. Gilbert’s book is full of interesting and important insights about pleasure and enjoyment and the “mistakes” we systematically make while (supposedly) seeking to maximize them. But is maximizing pleasure and enjoyment really our ultimate aim? And is it really what most people mean by “happiness?” Suppose that having kids fails to maximize overall pleasure over the life course and may even sometimes be net unpleasant. (Having lived through more tantrums and overflowing nappies than sleep deprivation permits me to count, I don’t disagree.) Does it follow that having kids makes you unhappy? Are studies like this really measuring happiness, or happiness of a kind that matters? To be clear, we should note that such studies are measuring pleasure (positive and negative affect) in a broad sense. We are not talking just about superficial fleeting bodily sensations which are obviously peripheral to happiness in the long-term sense, but psychologically deep and pervasive emotions and moods like the ratio of joy and engagement to stress and boredom. Still, does it really come as a surprise that kids are frequently exhausting and unpleasant? Or that a few particularly memorable moments of joy are, in some sense, outweighed by many fortunately less memorable moments of anxiety, fatigue, boredom, and frustration. The fact that many of us know this, and still treat kids as a source of happiness, suggests that (at least as many use the term) happiness is not simply to be identified with a favorable balance of enjoyment over suffering. (As books on pleasure and enjoyment don’t sell nearly so well as books on happiness, the temptation to relabel is understandable.) Moreover, the idea that happiness can be reduced to pleasure and enjoyment has historical precedent, albeit recent. Formed from the middle-English “hap,” “happiness” originally meant “fortunate” or “lucky” and referred to how well things were really going for a person, not simply to their (possibly deluded) state of mind. By the late 1700s, however, a new uniquely feeling-based way of thinking about happiness had emerged, especially in England, reinforced if not initiated by the work of influential thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham. Bentham famously put happiness front and center of his philosophy of how to live, proclaiming “greatest happiness” to be the sole end of conduct and “the foundation of morals and legislation.” He took pains to clarify that by “happiness” he did not mean what Aristotle meant (virtuous activity), but nothing more than a felt sensation. John Stuart Mill, followed in his godfather (Bentham’s) footsteps, but departed from him by insisting that pleasures and pains could and should be distinguished by their quality as well as quantity of felt experience. The “higher,” qualitatively superior pleasures make a greater contribution to happiness. Mill’s view sounds objectionably elitist, but it is not. The test of whether one type of pleasure is “higher” than another is simply whether someone who has experienced both types of pleasure would prefer it, when considering it just as a feeling (apart from its usefulness). Just as two glasses of wine may differ in their quality (as well as quantity), so Mill thought that one pleasant experience (e.g. the “flow” experienced by a musician absorbed in playing a challenging piece or a bushwalker immersed in nature) may be better quality than another (watching Netflix). Might having kids be, or at least lead to, higher pleasure? Possibly, though Mill, himself childless, never directly considers it. While Mill distinguished certain pleasures as superior in felt quality, pleasure itself — and so happiness — remained a wholly inner subjective experience. But there is a more ancient tradition of thought that takes happiness — or at any rate the kind of happiness most worth pursuing — to depend on its sources, as well as how it feels. Pleasure taken in the wrong sources — say, from a bottle, or which results from willful blindness or delusional thinking — is not authentic happiness, and contrasts with genuine pleasures of actual relationships and achievements. Think of the denizens of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World with their never-ending free supply of Soma. Are they really happy? Or are they living in a fool’s paradise? There is evidence that our assessments of happiness are sensitive not just to how someone feels, but also to the sources of these feelings; and hence that happiness, as ordinary people sometimes use this term, does not simply refer to pleasant feelings. Be that as it may, the kind of happiness (if it is) that comes out of a syringe is not the kind of happiness that most of us value most highly — otherwise denizens of Brave New World would be living the good life, but hardly anyone on reflection agrees with this. “Happiness” sometimes refers simply to a bunch of pleasant feelings, but it can refer to more than just feelings. While we care about feeling good, we often care about other things more. Creation, growth, a sense of achievement, and connection — even when things are difficult, challenging, or downright unpleasant. So, while we may agree that children are far from an unmitigated bundle of joy, we may want to resist the move to saying that they are not a great source of happiness — or, more generally, to identifying happiness simply with feeling good. There are other, perhaps more important, kinds of happiness. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Caroline West is a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Sydney.

After Ja Morant brilliantly fed Brandon Clarke for a tying dunk with 6.3 seconds to go, the Warriors advanced the ball to halfcourt with a timeout and then watched Klay Thompson miss a 19-footer. The rebound deflected off the Grizzlies, however, giving Golden State possession under its basket with still 2.6 seconds left. That’s when DiVincenzo, inbounding from the right side of the hoop, found Poole open on the weak side, and the high-scoring guard capped a 21-point night with the game winner in a crowd. With no timeouts left, the Grizzlies watched time run out as they fell for the fourth straight time on a five-game trip. Curry was ejected after leading a Golden State rally from a 111-102 deficit with 5:31 to play. Golden State used a 14-2 run, with Curry contributing 10 of the points, to go up 116-113 with 1:55 to play. Desmond Bane hit a free throw to cut the Memphis deficit to two, and when Thompson missed a jumper at the other end, a DiVincenzo offensive rebound allowed Golden State to retain possession. But instead of running down the clock, Poole fired a 30-foot attempt that so angered Curry, he threw his mouthpiece into the stands on his way back on defense, earning a technical foul and automatic ejection. Bane missed the technical, but when Morant scored on a drive with 1:02 to play, the game was tied and the stage was set for Poole’s heroics. Curry led the Warriors with 34 points, followed by Thompson with 24. Poole found time for 7 assists to complement his 21 points, while Draymond Green chipped in 8 points, a game-high 13 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocks. Jonathan Kuminga, starting in place of ill Andrew Wiggins, added 13 points for the Warriors, who have won both meetings with the Grizzlies this season after their tight playoff series last May. Morant finished with 29 points and a game-high 12 assists for the Grizzlies, whose trip ends Friday at Minnesota. Bane had 20 points, Clarke scored 19, Jaren Jackson Jr. 17, Santi Aldama 13, and Dillon Brooks 10 for Memphis, which will get two more shots at the defending champs – both at home – in March. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/child-anxious-starting-school-approaches-help/,[],"Why does one child experience excitement at the thought of starting the school year while another experiences debilitating anxiety? It’s rarely one thing and is often a combination of factors, including a child’s temperament and self-confidence; their previous experiences at school, kinder, or child care; friendships they’ve already formed; and the types of transition activities they’ve undertaken. As psychologists and mental health researchers, we also look at how the family is coping, and the child’s previous history of mental health or developmental disability diagnoses. The good news is research shows parents, schools, and health professionals can intervene early to support children who are feeling anxious about school. Our research team developed a program called AllPlay Learn to support children with disability, who are at higher risk of experiencing anxiety at school because of the additional load from new routines, friendships, expectations, and “sensory overload” (where the noise, clutter, smells, and other sensory input from the classroom or playground become overwhelming and distressing to a child). These strategies can help all children, parents, and teachers to better cope with the transition to school, or going back after the holidays. Anxiety in children isn’t always easy to spot. The symptoms can range from very subtle changes to body language, through to defiant behaviors such as anger and acting out. However, avoidant behavior is a hallmark feature for anxious children. Everyone can relate to gravitating to what makes us comfortable – being at home, engaging in things we like and are good at, and avoiding what makes us anxious or overwhelmed. At its extreme, anxious-avoidant behavior in relation to school can turn into school refusal, where a student regularly misses school with their parents’ knowledge due to school-related emotional distress. How parents communicate about the new school year is important. Speaking positively about school and learning can reduce feelings of anxiety in children. Parents can help children feel prepared and develop strategies to cope with feelings of anxiety by: Teacher support is important, particularly on arrival. Settling-in activities such as the choice to either read books or draw quietly can provide security to a child. Communicating clear expectations of students, such as class rules, can also build trust between children and their teacher. If a child is anxious, reflect on what aspects of school life might be contributing to anxious feelings and identify – with the child’s input – what they could manage with supports in place. For example, a child may feel able to separate from parents in the morning if they have a familiar toy or photo from home, and can have some quiet time in the classroom before the bell. Over time, these additional supports can be reduced. Allow children time and space to manage big emotions. Children may have different preferences for support when distressed, but may find it challenging to communicate their needs when anxious or upset. Provide structure and predictability. Visual schedules, social narratives (stories that tell children what they can expect at school), and warnings for transitions can provide security. Knowing what to do and who to play with can be challenging for a child who is feeling anxious, particularly during unstructured school time such as lunchtime. Some children may experience significant signs of anxiety such as not sleeping, social withdrawal, changes in eating habits, or significant ongoing distress or unhappiness. When children experience ongoing, significant signs of anxiety that don’t resolve, some additional supports may be needed to ensure your child’s wellbeing and feelings of safety at school. Talk to your GP, who can rule out underlying medical factors and refer you to appropriate support services, such as a child and adolescent psychologist. More evidence-based tips for supporting a child feeling anxious about starting the school year are available on the AllPlay Learn website.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-nuclear-energy-should-not-major-part-philippine-energy-system/,[],"Nuclear energy has emerged as one of the most controversial issues on energy security and national development in the Philippines. The most recent presidents, Rodrigo Duterte and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., have openly supported for nuclear to have a much larger presence in the country’s energy mix. At the moment, the nation is still in the stage of considering options for sites, technologies, and proposals for installing facilities. However, the Philippines has a chance to change its course and avoid making the same mistake again. Nuclear energy should not become a major part of the future Philippine energy system. Here are more reasons why. Proponents would highlight nuclear energy as a potential solution to address the climate crisis. However, as a mitigation option, solar and wind energy not only have much higher potential for reducing GHG emissions, but also are more cost-effective than nuclear energy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its most recent report, showed that mitigation options costing at most $100 per ton of CO2-eq can reduce global GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030. The options with the highest potential for reducing emissions are solar and wind energy, with more than three times the potential of nuclear. Promoting energy efficiency is also reported to be more effective in reducing emissions than nuclear. Renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency are key components of the country’s plans to reduce its pollution. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, the Philippines voluntarily pledged to reduce its GHG emissions by 75% within the current decade. If nuclear energy development proceeds, it would take up to 15 years for nuclear plants to be built, which would include the year 2030. This is the deadline for several global targets, including the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. While the current leadership has placed an emphasis on RE, gas (a fossil fuel), and nuclear power as its primary options to move away from coal, this policy direction lacks internal consistency in terms of the need to urgently address the climate crisis. As of now, the Philippines still lacks a comprehensive, detailed, long-term strategy for reducing its GHG emissions, despite having been a part of the Paris Agreement for seven years. Nuclear energy is likely to hinder the Philippines’s climate action strategies. It is therefore vital for the government to instead prioritize RE development and promoting energy efficiency towards the transformation of the Filipino nation. The power generation of coal plants, currently the main source for “baseload” power generation in the country, remains constant to minimize operational costs. However, this makes energy systems inflexible in responding to drastic changes in demand. This was observed during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns, coinciding when some coal plants had to be shut down for maintenance, resulting in several cases of “yellow alerts” and “red alerts” seen in different parts of the country. Moving forward, Philippine energy policymakers must prioritize a more flexible energy grid over emphasizing “baseload” generation. For decades, large-scale fossil fuel projects with long-term contracts have been favored as an attempt towards an energy system that minimizes costs. However, as the country heavily imports fossil fuels, this instead has resulted in an inflexible grid, volatile power prices, and an energy system more vulnerable to shocks brought by crises. Similarly, the Philippines has no known source of minerals that produce nuclear energy, like uranium or plutonium. This would leave the country in the same position it was in when it came to its reliance on coal. Coupled with a proposed gas expansion (another fossil fuel) and the current energy policy framework, replacing coal with two imported fuels to share the “baseload” generation would result in even higher electricity prices and a greater burden on Filipinos. The same argument has been brought up that the nation is not yet ready for RE to be the dominant energy source. However, what these stakeholders have failed to highlight is that the poor implementation of RE Act (Republic Act 9513) has contributed to slow RE growth domestically. Despite being a decade-plus-old law, the share of RE in the energy mix has actually decreased from 33.9% in 2008 to 22.4% as of 2021. Several studies have shown that RE has to comprise the majority of energy generation to achieve climate and development-related goals. A report by the Department of Energy itself showed that it is possible to attain a share of 50% for RE in the Luzon-Visayas grid by 2030. Achieving this involves enhancing system flexibility and coordination planning for improving generation and transmission. In a separate study, the International Energy Agency has projected that to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in responding to the climate crisis, RE has to make up more than 60% of the total energy supply in Southeast Asia by 2050. In this scenario, nuclear energy only has a very small percentage of the regional energy supply. Nuclear energy is not about recreating a legacy. It should not be about being selectively captivated by foreign trends or maintaining some status quo. It is a key issue that has tremendous implications on national sustainable development, from addressing the climate crisis to the well-being of Filipino consumers, and requires a comprehensive, inclusive policymaking process. Evidence clearly shows that nuclear energy poses many safety and security risks throughout its life cycle, would be too costly for Filipino consumers, and distract the country from implementing its climate actions, especially on RE. Instead, the Philippines must focus on becoming more self-sufficient in its energy generation by moving away from imported fuels, including coal, gas, and minerals responsible for nuclear power, and prioritizing the development of an adaptable energy system powered by indigenous sources, especially RE. – Rappler.com John Leo Algo is the Deputy Executive Director for Programs and Campaigns of Living Laudato Si’ Philippines.

As a general in a royalist military that ousted the governments of both Thaksin in 2006 and his sister Yingluck in 2014, Prayuth’s enmity with the billionaire Shinawatra family goes back more than a decade. In an election due by May, Prayuth, 68, could face off against Thaksin’s youngest daughter, Paetongtarn, who has garnered twice as much support, topping recent opinion polls on who should be Thailand’s next premier. “Don’t talk about that person. I don’t like it,” Prayuth said on Wednesday, January 25, cutting off a reporter’s question about Thaksin, before walking away from the podium and out of the venue. Former telecoms tycoon and Premier League football club owner Thaksin has been at the heart of 17 years of on-off tumult in Thailand, despite living in self-exile mostly in Dubai since 2008, to avoid a jail term that he maintains was engineered by rivals in the military and conservative establishment. Thaksin, 73, has been promoting his daughter’s candidacy and on Tuesday accused Prayuth of dragging his heels on dissolving parliament, while reiterating he would return to Thailand soon. Paetongtarn, 36, last week declared her readiness to be prime minister with the Pheu Thai Party, which won most seats in the 2019 election but not enough to form a government. The Shinawatras and their allies have won unprecedented majorities in five elections since 2001, campaigning on Thaksin’s name and populist policies that earned a loyal following among working-class Thais. Prayuth, who has joined a new party, is expected to seek the premiership again after eight years in charge as both a junta chief and head of a 17-party coalition. – Rappler.com"

Embiid shot just 6-of-18 from the field but hit all 13 of his free throws. James Harden contributed 23 points, De’Anthony Melton had 19 points and 3 blocks, and Tobias Harris chipped in with 18 points for the Sixers, who won their sixth game in a row. The Sixers went 35-of-36 overall from the free throw line. Seth Curry led the Nets with 32 points and Kyrie Irving added 30 points and 10 assists. Nic Claxton had 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 2 blocks. Ben Simmons scored 12 points in his second game against his former team in Philadelphia. Simmons was booed by the fans throughout the game. The game was tied at 41 at the end of the first quarter, marking the first time all season that both teams scored at least 40 points in the opening 12 minutes in any NBA game. The Sixers went ahead, 69-58, with 4:22 left in the second when Harden threw a pass through Simmons’ legs to Embiid for a layup. After a high-scoring first half, the Sixers led 75-65 thanks in large part to Maxey’s 16 points off the bench. The game was tense with five technical fouls, 18 personal fouls and 32 free throw attempts in the first half. Embiid converted a three-point play with 6:01 left in the third for a 94-77 advantage. Simmons threw down an alley-oop dunk with 1:56 remaining and the Nets closed within 100-89. After an empty Sixers possession, Curry hit two free throws to slice the deficit to nine. After the Sixers extended their lead to 14 early in the fourth, the Nets soon used an 8-0 run to get within 116-110 following Curry’s trey from the corner. Curry’s three-pointer with 4:06 to go tied the game at 120. Harden responded with a trey for the Sixers. After Claxton scored in the lane, Harden knocked down another triple for a 126-122 advantage. When Maxey hit a trey from the wing with 1:40 left, the Sixers led, 131-124. Irving came back with a three-pointer, Claxton added a dunk and the deficit was two. Both teams scored on their next two possessions, leaving Philadelphia up by two with 13.1 seconds left. After a timeout, Melton was fouled and sank both free throws, and a subsequent Embiid steal sealed the win. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/nlex-braces-for-worst-jonathon-simmons-overseas-offers/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – NLEX head coach Frankie Lim said he is not getting in the way of import Jonathon Simmons if he decides to leave the Road Warriors for greener pastures. Simmons’ stint with NLEX in the PBA Governors’ Cup may end up a short one as he received an offer to play in the Chinese Basketball Association, where pay for imports like him – a former NBA player at that – is significantly higher. “When he told me that he has to go to China to play, I told him, ‘Finish first your contract here. Maybe you can give us four wins before you leave.’ [But] I cannot stop him,” said Lim in Filipino. “A lot of money is involved.” Simmons came in with the most impressive credentials among this batch of imports, having played for the San Antonio Spurs, Orlando Magic, and Philadelphia 76ers over a span of four NBA seasons. In 258 games, he averaged 8.3 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.9 assists. He proved his mettle for the Road Warriors in his PBA debut, churning out 32 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 steals in a 124-102 blowout of Blackwater on Wednesday, January 25. “It is hard especially if you really like the import. It hurts,” Lim said. “It is hard. But life goes on. You need to be able to deal with these kind of situations. We cannot stop him from leaving. Just get another one. That is the only solution.” Lim said new team manager Larry Fonacier is in the process of bringing in a new import. “We’re looking at somebody else to replace [Simmons]. But when he will be here is all up to Larry.” NLEX, though, holds on to the slim possibility of Simmons having a change of heart and deciding to reinforce the Road Warriors for the long run. “There is a chance that he might stay longer. That was what I was told earlier. That changes every six hours,” Lim quipped. NLEX eyes a 2-0 start as it battles NorthPort on Saturday, January 28, at the Ynares Center in Antipolo. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/opinion-time-up-fluorescent-mercury-lamps/,[],"Having adequate lighting is essential for every Filipino. A source of light, especially at night, increases security and protection, particularly for women, children, and vulnerable members of the family. Lighting also extends social and economic activities in the community. It is, therefore, important that lighting devices be safe and not cause harm to public health and the environment. Sadly, toxic lamps containing mercury, a potent neurotoxin, are still being used and readily available in the local market. Mercury can be found in general lighting devices such as tubular fluorescent and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). It is also present in common commercial and industrial devices such as cold cathode fluorescent lamps and external electrode fluorescent lamps. In a recent market survey conducted by the non-profit Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology, CREST found old and new stocks of mercury lamps still being sold in hardware stores, shopping malls, and even online retail platforms. Mercury is a very toxic element that bioaccumulates when it enters the food chain. The toxin is passed from one creature to another and grows in concentration as it moves through the food chain. Hence there is no “safe” level of mercury in the environment. A single broken CFL thrown into the environment has enough mercury to contaminate 30,000 liters of water, making it unsafe for drinking. Mercury exposure can have serious health effects including neurological damage, reproductive system damage, behavioral problems, and learning disabilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified mercury as one of the top ten chemicals that cause major public health concerns. Indiscriminate dumping of busted mercury lamps persists. Just recently, members of the public network EcoWaste Coalition discovered dumped abandoned fluorescent lamps along a major road in Quezon City. The group called the attention of the city government to enforce its local ordinances on the safe disposal of lamps containing mercury. The importation, distribution, and use of mercury are controlled under Philippine laws. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Order 2019-20, titled “Revised Chemical Control Order on Mercury and Mercury-compounds,” sets the schedule for the phase-out of different mercury-containing devices, with fluorescent and other mercury lamps identified to be phased out by 2022. Advancements in LED lighting technology have already made fluorescent and other mercury lamps obsolete. LED lighting is more energy-efficient, has a longer lifespan, is safer, and is already cost-competitive. The management and disposal of LED lighting are safer since these devices do not contain mercury. The Philippines was the first country in Asia to phase out less energy-efficient incandescent lighting in 2010. As part of the transition, the Philippine government loaned an amount of $31 million from the Asian Development Bank in 2009 to promote the use of compact fluorescent lamps in the country. The Philippine government, through the Department of Energy, used the loaned amount to distribute 8.6 million units of CFLs to various residential and commercial consumers. At least 40 government-owned buildings were also retrofitted to use fluorescent lamps for lighting. The DENR identified that by 2018, there were already 588.5 million units of double-end fluorescent and 147 million units of CFLs used in the country. This translates to 25.5 tons of mercury present in residential homes, schools, and establishments. In the quest to eliminate less efficient incandescent lighting, the Philippine government and the ADB failed to foresee and mitigate the potential impacts of the replacement technology. The collection, management, and disposal of CFLs are very problematic due to its mercury content. There are only a few recycling facilities in the country that can process post-consumed mercury-containing devices. Most fluorescent lamps are thrown into the environment or end up in dumpsites and landfills. One hundred thirty-nine nations, including the Philippines, are party to the Minamata Convention that aims to control the anthropogenic release of mercury throughout its lifecycle. Entered into force in 2013, the Convention has been instrumental in banning new mercury mines and in phasing down and phasing out many mercury-containing devices. During the last Minamata Convention held in Indonesia on March 2022, parties to the Convention set the phase-out for the production, distribution, and sale of CFLs with integrated ballast for general lighting by 2025. The phase-out schedule for the linear fluorescent is to be tackled this year. In a report published by the global network Clean Lighting Coalition (CLiC), the global elimination of fluorescent lamps and transition to mercury-free LED lighting will result in an avoidance of 3.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2035. The Philippine target of 2022 is actually ahead of Minamata Convention’s timetable, which is a win for our communities and environment. LED is already sold in the market at very competitive prices compared to mercury lamps. According to CLiC, phasing out the exportation and sale of fluorescent will result in the Philippines saving electricity up to 70.16 terawatt-hours and financial savings equivalent to $12.6 billion by 2050. The Philippine government should start to clamp down on the importation, sale, and distribution of CFLs and other fluorescent lamps in the market in compliance with the Revised Chemical Control Order on Mercury. Malls and retailers should now pull out fluorescent lamps from their shelves and inventories. Home and building owners as well as commercial centers should start shifting to LED lighting and replacing existing fluorescent lamps. The DENR and DOE, in turn, must partner with local governments and recyclers to set up community collection centers where residents can drop off busted CFLs and other fluorescent lamps. This should be followed by a massive information campaign to inform consumers about safe handling and disposal of these products. Consumers should be discouraged in just throwing mercury lamps in their trash bins as this practice can easily harm their families, our frontline waste workers and the environment. – Rappler.com Danielle Lacsamana is the #EndToxicLighting campaigner of Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (CREST), a public interest group working on climate and sustainable energy programs."
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/andrew-tate-research-shows-feminist-progress-followed-misogynistic-backlash/,[],"Andrew Tate is a man who has made a living out of controversy. The extensive media coverage garnered since his arrest in Romania on suspicion of rape, human trafficking, and organized crime has largely called him out for his misogynistic views. This matters, because he is a literal influencer. Tate has known a lightning rise to global fame and the kind of viral reach that most of his peers only dream of, despite having been banned by many platforms. By his own account, his strategy has been to get his followers to extend his reach by reposting his content. It is what one criminologist has termed “incendiary content sharing.” In doing so, he has amassed a fortune from billions of views of his videos and via subscriptions to his Hustlers University, where men and boys pay for tips on getting rich. The fact that he routinely describes himself as a “high-net worth individual” feeds right back into the appeal of the content. Quite how much money he actually has is unclear, but disenfranchised boys and men are taken in by his confident message that if they do as he says, they too will be rich and ripped and in control. Tate’s responses to accusations of being misogynistic and sexist vary. He has variously agreed, deflected – fine, he says, call me that, I don’t care – or denied, declaiming the love he has for women. He has also claimed that he says what he says as part of a persona he’s taken on online. Whether he acknowledges it or not, however, research shows that everything Tate is selling, from the language he uses to describe women to the positions he holds on sexual assault, partner control, and a woman’s worth, justifies those labels. And the danger inherent to the term “influencer,” however accurate, is that it effectively lends legitimacy to the idea that such misogynistic content is something to be sold in the same way that another social media influencer might “sell” a holiday or “boost” a fashion brand. In my 2021 book, The Incel Rebellion, I look at the incel (involuntary celibate) community and the broader “manosphere,” the online movement of anti-feminist websites that focus primarily on so-called “men’s issues.” Disillusioned men and boys are latching on to public figures on the internet who have based their identity on talking about women and sex in a derogatory manner and prioritizing working out and earning money. They tend to promote regressive, unimaginative ideas about gender, relationships, dating, and sex. They are aspirational, demonstrating power and appeal to men and boys who feel that society has left them behind. In the manosphere, there is an overriding sense of male victimhood. Tate has capitalized on the idea that men are oppressed. He presents simplistic explanations that legitimize this idea that men are being wronged by societal efforts towards gender equality. And he is weaponizing it for his own financial gain. Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells showed, in his 2012 book, Networks of Outrage and Hope, how the internet has granted unprecedented allure and reach to people such as Tate. Their ideas, however, are not new. Tate’s philosophy is but the latest iteration of what communications scholar Sara Banet-Weiser terms “popular misogyny.” Research shows that every instance of feminist progression has systematically been followed by a backlash, from those who feel their privileges are being stripped away. This matters because violence against women endures. One in three women – around 736 million globally – is subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence from a non-partner across their lifetime. This percentage has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. Many more women experience sexual harassment, street harassment and other unwanted sexual behaviour and advances. But, as British scholar Liz Kelly has long shown, there is a connection between such seemingly banal, everyday intrusions into women’s sexual autonomy and the rarer, though certainly more serious occurrences of rape and sexual assault. In 1987 already, in her book, Women, Violence, and Social Control, Kelly highlighted what she terms “the continuum of sexual violence.” She describes how sexism, sexual harassment, and sexual violence are not independent behavior. Micro-sexisms (misogynistic comments, for example) occur so frequently that they become normalized. This in turn leads to acts of sexual violence and harassment being excused or validated. As gendered violence experts Michael Flood and Stephen Burrell note, male sexual violence is the inevitable outcome of a society in which boys grow up learning a version of manhood based on sexism and gender inequality. Tate’s supporters defend him, citing the videos he has made with titles including “Women are beautiful,” and “Why women are the most precious thing.” Yet these videos only perpetuate the tropes that women’s sole value is in how they look and in their sexual availability, and that they need to be protected and controlled by men. Tate is capitalizing on the deeply narrow idea, celebrated in the wider, dominant western culture, of male success as defined by physical prowess, sports cars, and money, combined with controlling women. And he is wielding the tremendous, monetized influence he has on young men in particular, with seeming disregard for the harmful behaviors that, as research has long shown, such views can engender. – Rappler.com Lisa Sugiura is a Reader in Cybercrime and Gender, University of Portsmouth.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/thousands-invasion-day-protests-australia-day-holiday-2023/,[],"SYDNEY, Australia – Thousands of Australians marked the country’s national day celebrations on Thursday with rallies in support of Indigenous people, many of whom describe the anniversary of the day a British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbor as “Invasion Day.” In Sydney, the capital of New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state – social media showed a large crowd gathered at an “Invasion Day” rally in the central business district, where some people carried aboriginal flags and an indigenous smoking ceremony took place. Similar protests took place in other Australian state capitals, including in South Australia’s Adelaide where around 2,000 people attended, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Speaking at a flag-raising and citizenship ceremony in Australia’s capital, Canberra, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese honored the nation’s indigenous people, who have occupied the land for at least 65,000 years. “Let us all recognize the unique privilege that we have to share this continent with the world’s oldest continuous culture,” Albanese said. While it was a “difficult day” for Indigenous Australians, there were no plans to change the holiday’s date, he said. An annual poll by market research company Roy Morgan released this week showed nearly two-thirds of Australians say January 26 should be considered “Australia Day,” largely unchanged from a year ago. The rest believe it should be “Invasion Day.” Amid the debate, some companies have adopted flexibility around observance of the holiday. Australia’s largest telecoms company, Telstra Corporation, this year gave its staff the option to work on January 26 and take another day off instead. “For many First Nations peoples, Australia Day…marks a turning point that saw lives lost, culture devalued, and connections between people and places destroyed,” Telstra chief executive officer Vicki Brady wrote on LinkedIn. Many of Australia’s 880,000 or so indigenous people out of a population of 25 million lag behind others on economic and social indicators in what the government calls “entrenched inequality.” This year’s holiday comes as Albanese’s center-left Labor Party government plans a referendum on recognizing indigenous people in the constitution, and requiring consultation with them on decisions that affect their lives. The government plans to introduce legislation in March to set up the referendum that will take place later this year, as the Indigenous voice shapes as a key federal political issue. The constitution, which came into effect in January 1901 and can’t be amended without a referendum, does not refer to the country’s Indigenous people. One of the people at Sydney’s protest, Abi George, said it was not a happy day for all Australians, especially Indigenous people. “Nobody’s got the right to celebrate genocide,” she said. Another protester, Vivian Macjohn, said the rally against the national day was a show of support for indigenous people. “I think it’s important that we show up and we mourn with them and stand in solidarity,” she said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/european-union-wants-send-more-people-back-africa-middle-east-asia/,[],"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – European Union migration ministers meet on Thursday, January 26, to discuss visa restrictions and better coordination inside the bloc to be able to send more people with no right to asylum in Europe back to their home countries including Iraq. Three years after the 27-nation EU agreed to restrict visas for countries deemed failing to cooperate on taking their people back, only Gambia has been formally punished. The EU’s executive European Commission proposed similar steps vis-a-vis Iraq, Senegal and Bangladesh, though two EU officials said cooperation with Dhaka on returning people has since improved. Still, the EU’s overall rate of effective returns stood at 21% in 2021, according to Eurostat data, the latest available. “That is a level that member states consider unacceptably low,” said one of the EU officials. Immigration is a highly politically sensitive topic in the bloc where member countries would much rather discuss stepping up returns, as well as reducing irregular immigration in the first place, than revive their bitter feuds over how to share out the task of caring for those who make it to Europe and win the right to stay. “Establishing an effective and common EU system for returns is a central pillar of well-functioning and credible migration and asylum systems,” the Commission said in a discussion paper for the ministers, which was seen by Reuters. Some 160,000 people made it across the Mediterranean in 2022, according to UN data, the main route to Europe for people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. On top of that, nearly 8 million Ukrainian refugees were also registered across Europe. The ministers meet two weeks before the 27 EU national leaders gather in Brussels to discuss migration, and are also expected to call to send more people away. “Swift action is needed to ensure effective returns from the European Union to countries of origin using as leverage all relevant EU policies,” read a draft of their joint statement, which was also seen by Reuters. Inside the EU, however, there is insufficient resources and coordination between different parts of government to ensure each a person with no right to stay is effectively returned or deported, according to the Commission. “Insufficient cooperation of countries of origin is an additional challenge,” it added, naming problems including recognising and issuing identity and travel documents. But pressure from migration chiefs to punish some third countries with visa restrictions has in the past run against the EU’s own foreign and development ministers, or failed due to conflicting agendas of various EU countries. There has therefore not been enough majority among EU countries so far to punish another country apart from Gambia, where people can no longer get multiple entry visas to the bloc and face a longer wait. While EU countries including Austria and Hungary loudly protest against the mainly-Muslim, irregular immigration from the Middle East and North Africa, Germany is among those seeking to open up their job market to much-needed workers from outside the bloc. – Rappler.com"

Minister for Education Jason Clare condemned Ye’s “awful” anti-Semitic comments involving Hitler and the Holocaust, saying others who had made similar statements had been denied visas. “People like that who’ve applied for visas to get into Australia in the past have been rejected,” Clare said in an interview on Channel Nine. “I expect that if he does apply he would have to go through the same process and answer the same questions that they did.” A spokesperson for Ye did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Local media reported that Ye would visit to Australia to meet the family of his partner, Bianca Censori, who grew up in Melbourne.

In an advisory, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of Britain’s GCHQ eavesdropping intelligence agency, said Cold River researches its targets and impersonates people around them using faked email addresses and social media profiles. “There is often some correspondence between attacker and target, sometimes over an extended period, as the attacker builds rapport,” the advisory said. Russia’s embassies in London and Washington did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment about the NCSC’s comments. The advisory did not directly attribute the digital attacks to the Russian government. Once a rapport has been built with a target, Cold River hackers encourage the target to click on a malicious link which tricks them into entering their login credentials on a website controlled by the group, the advisory said. The hackers use those stolen credentials to log into the target’s email accounts, “from where they are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victim’s inbox,” it added. Reuters reported that Cold River, also known as “Callisto” and “Seaborgium”, targeted three nuclear research laboratories in the United States last summer and published private emails from former British spymaster Richard Dearlove in May. Russia’s Foreign Ministry criticised the nuclear labs story, calling it anti-Russian propaganda. A second, Iran-based, group known as Charming Kitten has deployed the same “spear-phishing” techniques to gather information, according to the NCSC.

But Obiena stumbled at 5.82m, while Kendricks took just one try to clear the height en route to his first gold medal of the year. Obiena faltered midair in his first two attempts at 5.82m then hit the bar on his way down in his final vault. Belgium’s Ben Broeders snagged bronze with a clearance of 5.72m as he skipped 5.77m and tallied three fouls at 5.82m. Other competitors were Gillian Ladwig and Bo Kanda Lita Baehre of Germany, Piotr Lisek of Poland, Matt Ludwig of the United States, Rutger Koppelaar of the Netherlands, Oleksandr Onufriyev of Ukraine, and Huang Bokai of China. Much is expected from Obiena this year after a stellar 2022 campaign that saw him bag 12 gold medals, including one in the Brussels Diamond League in Belgium, where he stunned world record holder Armand Duplantis of Sweden. Obiena also pocketed a historic bronze in the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, USA as he set a new Asian record of 5.94m. He wrapped up the outdoor season last year with pair of gold medals from the Golden Fly Series in Liechtenstein and Gala dei Castelli in Switzerland in September. – Rappler.com"

The humble onion is at the center of the crisis, with prices reaching as high as P600 per kilo, seven times higher than the world average, at around P80 per kilo. Over 21,000 metric tons of onions were recently approved for importation to the country, but only 5,000 MT will be coming in due to import clearances. This importation also comes at a bad time, just when local farmers are ready to harvest their onion crops.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/national-commission-culture-arts-suggests-incentives-addressing-piracy-aid-local-film-industry/,[],"ILOCOS NORTE, Philippines – The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) National Committee on Cinema vice head Butch Ibañez presented to the House committee on creative industry and performing arts on Tuesday, January 17 a number of steps to further elevate the current landscape of the Philippine film sector. At the House hearing, Ibañez said these steps would help Filipino filmmakers produce quality work and increase the chances of local actors in achieving prestigious film awards. According to Ibañez, the government must respond to a lack of financial incentives, piracy issues, and high movie ticket prices. This hearing commenced in the midst of Filipino actress Dolly de Leon receiving a series of international awards. On Tuesday, January 24, De Leon won as best actress in a supporting role at Sweden’s Guldbagge Awards for her performance in the Ruben Östlund black comedy Triangle of Sadness. In December 2022, De Leon also won the Best Supporting Performance prize at the LA Film Critics Association Awards, and made history as the first Filipino actor to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award. She also earned a nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. De Leon’s recent collection of awards makes her one of the few local artists to be noticed in the international film scene. What should be considered in implementing the steps Ibañez mentioned? Some resource persons at the House hearing gave their thoughts. Rappler also spoke to award-winning director and University of the Philippines Visayas professor Kevin Piamonte about the realities that Filipino filmmakers face. In his presentation, Ibañez mentioned the need for travel grants for filmmakers participating in film workshops and festivals. Entering a national film festival is not as affordable as it may seem. According to a 2017 report from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, filmmakers who plan to enter the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) must pay P30,000 for script submissions and P50,000 for completed movies. If one plans to dabble in the international scene, quality work alone won’t always suffice. Major events such as the Tribeca Film Festival will cost up to $500 or around P27,315. Plane tickets to fly to the film fest in New York would cost more than P45,000 at the lowest, based on a quick Skyscanner search for cheap flights as of Wednesday, January 25. In an interview with Rappler, Piamonte, who has received an award from the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (FAMAS), said that getting noticed by international award-giving bodies can be very expensive, as it requires screenings outside the country and support from the government. “If you are talking about big game international award giving bodies, the government will have to step in and help promote local films. And promotions to get noticed in the international scene can be very expensive. You have to screen your films in cinemas abroad,” said Piamonte. “Naturally, you need bucketloads of funding to be able to do this. You also need to hire an international public relations firm to position your work to get noticed. It’s really a campaign, and as we know, campaigns need a lot of funding,” the Iloilo-based director added. In Ibañez’s presentation, he pushed for tax breaks and incentives to ease the burden of filmmakers when it comes to the extravagant funds required to produce a film. Former Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) chairman and CEO Liza Diño said in a July 2021 Variety story that the median production cost of an average production in the country is around P8 million. Taxes in the film industry is a great dilemma as they take up a huge chunk of their filmmaking expenses, Philippine Motion Pictures Producers Association (PMPPA) member Joji Alonso said in the House hearing. Pangasinan 4th District Representative Christopher de Venecia, the committee chairman, brought up the issue of piracy in the hearing. According to the YouGov 2022 Piracy Landscape Survey, 61% of Filipinos admitted to consuming pirated content, making the Philippines one of Asia Pacific’s leading consumers. De Venecia pointed to the situation in Indonesia, where there was a 55% drop in piracy consumption between 2019 and 2020, also according to YouGov. This was made possible by the blocking of 2,300 piracy streaming sites and illicit streaming devices by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology in collaboration with the Video Coalition of Indonesia. Alonso said that although the suggestion may have worked in Indonesia, she was unsure as to how it could work in the Philippines, because pirates spread illegal streaming links on different social media platforms. Some 44% of the Filipino respondents in the 2022 YouGov survey said they consumed pirated content through social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok. “That would be a most welcome move if we could block those piracy sites but unfortunately, the technology right now of the pirates is not just limited to those piracy sites but the sell or share via Telegram, Viber, and Messenger,” said Alonso. “So I really don’t know what can be done in terms of accessing all these social media sites or messaging sites – if there’s any way to block also the exchanges of links, because that’s how it’s done,” Alonso added, adding that an MMFF movie can be streamed for as low as P10. In his presentation, Ibañez called for more affordable ticket prices to cater to a wider audience demographic. Along with the rise of the country’s inflation rate comes an increase in cinema ticket prices. Popular malls’ movie ticket prices are at least P300, according to information from entertainment and lifestyle website ClickTheCity. In comparison, Filipino blog Para Sa Pinoy posted that ticket prices of cinemas in Robinsons Malls in 2018 started at P240. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, cinematheques like micro-theater Cinema ’76 in San Juan were not allowed to operate due to quarantine and health restrictions. They were later forced to shut down. The NCCA vice head also pushed for the establishment of more small cinemas located in different parts of the Philippines to give all Filipinos a chance to screen local films and alternative content. “We would also like to give access to people, so if there’s a way to have more microcinemas accessible to the public that can support alternative content, because cinemas already have that market,” said Ibañez. – Ryand Ugalde/Rappler.com Ryand Ugalde is a Rappler volunteer studying at Mariano Marcos State University.

https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/peru-lawmakers-motion-impeach-president-dina-boluarte/,[],"LIMA, Peru – A group of Peruvian lawmakers on Wednesday, January 25, submitted a motion that looks to impeach President Dina Boluarte, according to a document seen by Reuters, citing “permanent moral incapacity.” The bid to remove Boluarte comes in the midst of violent protests following the impeachment and arrest of her predecessor, former president Pedro Castillo, that have left dozens dead. The motion, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, was signed by 28 leftist members of congress who support Castillo. A minimum of 20%, or 26 signatures, was required to file the motion. The motion must now be approved by 52 votes before it can be debated in Congress where it must win two-thirds of the chamber’s support. “Never in the history of Peru has a government in so little time – a month in governance – killed more than 40 people in protests,” the motion said, accusing Boluarte of allowing the abuse and disproportionate use of force, among other accusations. Boluarte’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She has blamed Castillo, who is in pretrial detention, for promoting political polarization during his nearly 17 months in power. On Tuesday, January 24, Boluarte called for a “political truce.” She has also accused drug traffickers and others of stirring up the violence on the streets. Peru’s ombudsman office said there were more than 90 blockades across the country on Wednesday and one person was killed in Cusco city. At least 47 people have died in clashes since the protests began in December, according to the office, including one police officer, while hundreds have been injured. Human rights groups accuse police and soldiers of using excessive force, including live ammunition and dropping tear gas from helicopters. Security forces say protesters, mostly in Peru’s southern Andes, used homemade weapons and explosives. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/twitter-suspends-account-white-supremacist-nick-fuentes-after-restoration/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Social media platform Twitter on Wednesday, January 25, suspended the account of white supremacist Nick Fuentes only a day after a decision to restore it led to widespread criticism. In a Twitter Space on Tuesday after his account was restored, Fuentes made several antisemitic comments, according to Hannah Gais, a senior researcher at Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. After his suspension on Wednesday, Fuentes asked his followers on Telegram to call for his account to be restored. The white supremacist was suspended from a number of social media platforms for hate speech in 2020 and 2021, including Facebook and YouTube, in addition to Twitter. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about its latest decisions on Fuentes’ account. The platform’s new owner, billionaire Elon Musk, calls himself a free speech absolutist. Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter has reversed suspensions of some accounts that were removed under its previous ownership, most notably the account of former President Donald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter over accusations of inciting violence after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Human rights groups have raised concerns about hate speech on Twitter since its takeover by Musk. Fuentes came back into headlines late last year when Trump hosted him and the musician formerly known as Kanye West at his private club in Florida. Trump said the encounter with Fuentes happened inadvertently while he was having dinner with West. West, now called Ye, has also drawn widespread criticism for a spate of antisemitic comments and was suspended recently from social media platforms, including Twitter. Americans’ belief in antisemitic conspiracy theories and tropes has nearly doubled since 2019, according to an Anti-Defamation League survey released earlier this month. The White House addressed rising antisemitism in a roundtable event with Jewish leaders in December and President Joe Biden established an inter-agency group to coordinate efforts to counter antisemitism. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/marcos-jr-delegation-international-trips/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. assumed office and embarked on his first trip abroad, Malacañang has not released in an official manner the delegation that he brings with him to state visits, summits, and general assemblies outside of the country. It’s a less-than-ideal situation for media covering the President and an even lesser ideal for a public that’s entitled to know who are part of any working, official, or state visits that entails spending taxpayers’ money. Yet even as the Palace has not been the most forthright in disclosing the delegation list, it also has not been exactly secretive. (READ: Marcos defends cost of foreign trips: It’s about return on investment) Traveling media – or even journalists covering the President’s departure and arrival speeches – can typically see for themselves who’ll be flying out or who has flown back in alongside Marcos. Here’s a rough guide on the typical presidential entourage that accompanies Marcos in his trips overseas: Lawyer Liza Araneta-Marcos is almost always by the President’s side when he flies out of the country for official (and even the unannounced, unofficial) trips. Typically, during summits or assemblies of regional and international organizations, the spouses or the heads of state or government have side events to attend – these side events include cultural tours or luncheons. The First Lady also joins the President’s side meetings and events. In Davos for the World Economic Forum, for instance, she joined a luncheon with Filipino business executives. She also accompanies the President in formal galas or dinners during these summits or assemblies. It’s no secret that Araneta-Marcos plays an active role in her husband’s politics. She was a main decision maker in his 2022 presidential run, as she was in his failed bid for the vice presidency in 2016 and his bid to contest that election. But the lawyer and law professor has insisted she does not meddle in her husband’s work as president, telling the public – through the chief of the Presidential Security Group – that she’d shut down whoever tries to use her name in securing a post in government. But her role, according to the President, doesn’t include having a say in policy matters of the administration. (READ: Marcos: I only consult the First Lady on legal, not policy matters) In the 2022 campaign, Romualdez was a constant in now-Vice President Sara Duterte’s sorties and events (he was, after all, co-campaign manager for her team). Post-win, in the Marcos-Duterte administration, Romualdez is a constant in nearly all of Marcos’ trips abroad. The House Speaker, who heads a Marcos-allied supermajority chamber, is also the President’s first-degree cousin through former first lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos. He has joined practically all of Marcos’ foreign trips and often has a prominent spot in his bilateral meetings with fellow heads of state and in business meetings. In Brussels, after Marcos lost his voice, it was Romualdez who faced the media during a previously scheduled briefing. That same trip, the House Speaker left ahead of the rest of the delegation because he had to be at Batasan to preside over the House’s last session in 2022. His inclusion in the delegation has been explained this way by administration officials: as one of two heads of Congress, Romualdez is in the best position to understand what the legislative branch of government can do to address the concerns of potential and existing investors. The former congressman is another regular in the delegation. He joined the trip to Davos and was also present in China during the 2023 state visit. Lagdameo, a close friend of the President’s, has generally kept a low profile during these visits but appears prominently in photos and videos of the various meetings Marcos leads. While the former president is technically only a recent addition to the Marcos delegation – she joined Marcos for the first time to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bangkok – the impact she’s made cannot be denied. In Thailand, she joined Marcos’ first bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was reportedly surprised to see his “old friend.” When Marcos flew to Beijing for a state visit, Arroyo was also there – Marcos said she was “our consultant who actually was leading the way in many of our meetings.” She also joined Marcos in Brussels for the first ever Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-European Union (EU) summit, where she also joined him in his bilateral meetings. She was also part of the delegation to Davos for WEF. Arroyo was a key ally of Marcos in the 2022 election. The Lakas-CMD president emeritus (Speaker Romualdez is the current president), according to sources, helped broker support from long-time allies who were, perhaps, willing to support Sara Duterte but on the fence about Marcos. The senator has been another familiar face in presidential trips – although, as his 2022 campaign jingle promised, he makes little noise. His presence was made most prominent in Brussels, when Speaker Romualdez was asked about the controversial Maharlika funds. There, the House leader said he was hopeful the measure would be deliberated in the Senate, partly through the help of Villar. As promised, it was Villar, chairperson of both the committee on banks, financial Institutions and currencies and the committee on trade, commerce and entrepreneurship, who sponsored the measure in the Senate. Marcos’ justification for Villar’s presence is the same: that the legislature needs to be there in person to hear about the proposed “changes in policy.” The Senate, like the House, is dominated by a Marcos-allied supermajority with an opposition bloc of two legislators. The secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), a veteran diplomat and the son of two veterans before him, is a constant in the President’s trips. In some cases, he flies out ahead of the President. As the nation’s second top diplomat (next to the President, of course), Manalo also holds bilateral meetings and other side meetings during these trips. The DFA secretary travels with deputies – undersecretaries and assistant secretaries – the mix of which depends on the trip. For instance, Assistant Secretary for ASEAN Affairs Daniel Espiritu was in Phnom Penh for the ASEAN meeting and again in Belgium for the ASEAN-EU Summit. In Davos, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and International Economic Relations Carlos Sorreta was the highest-ranking foreign affairs official to join the delegation. The presidential son, despite being a first-term legislator, is a senior ranking member of 19th Congress. His previous legislative experience includes working under his uncle Speaker Romualdez when the latter was Majority Leader. The younger Marcos, who represents the first district of Ilocos Norte, has had a front seat to the diplomatic side of the presidency. In Singapore, he joined his parents for a breakfast with Lee Hsien Loong and his wife. In New York, he joined the bilateral meeting with United States President Joe Biden. Representative Marcos also joined his parents in Davos. Garafil first joined the President’s delegation – then, as just the office-in-charge of what was then called the Office of the Press Secretary – to Cambodia for ASEAN, then to Bangkok for APEC. The lawyer and former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chief joined the Palace in October 2022, shortly after the first communications chief, vlogger Trixie Cruz-Angeles, resigned less than three months into her role. As communications secretary, Garafil mostly kept out of the spotlight, unlike her predecessor. Her office, now called the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), handles everything, from preparing transcripts from the President’s speaking engagements to press releases from his events and engagements. In Davos, her team also released to the media transcripts of interviews with delegation members defending Marcos’ participation in the glizty summit, as well as his promotion of the Maharlika fund. Under the PCO team for these trips are several other government officials, including undersecretaries or assistant secretaries that handle Malacañang and Marcos’ social media accounts, media relations, and the like. Zagala – set for promotion to brigadier general – heads the group tasked to protect the President and his family. He is also Marcos’ senior military assistant and often joins him on trips abroad. The former Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson is a third-generation military man. His father, former Army chief Rafael Zagala, was part of the so-called “Rolex 12,” or the military men reportedly gifted Rolex watches by president Ferdinand E. Marcos, the incumbent’s father, as a “thank you” for their work. The entertainment director was appointed a presidential adviser in October 2022 and, in his own words, spent the rest of the year orienting himself on the workings of government. Soriano is related to the First Lady and is the wedding godson of the First Couple. His wife, Youtube show host and celebrity Toni Gonzaga, was among Marcos’ most prominent and celebrity endorsers. As presidential adviser on creative communication, Paul Soriano, has promised to “creatively communicate what’s in the heart” of Marcos. Yet his is an office without a budget of its own – he will, instead, work with other agencies and tap into their resources. He first joined Marcos on the trip to Bangkok for APEC. Almost always, Marcos has with him members of the economic cluster of the Cabinet. Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual and Information and Communications Technology Ivan Uy are frequent members of the delegation. Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno has been on several major trips (the US, China, Davos), as well as National Economic and Development Authority’s Arsenio Balisacan. Both Diokno and Balisacan stayed behind in Switzerland after Marcos and his delegation returned to the Philippines to go around Europe for their own official engagements. Other economic team members who have joined the delegation include Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, and Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista, among others. On some trips, the economic team leads a briefing in hopes of encouraging investments from businesses based in whatever country they are in. Thus far, the delegation has brought home pledges and re-affirmations of earlier pledges. Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople has also joined the President on several trips, as well as in bilateral meetings held on the sidelines of those trips. The “official delegation” of presidential trips under Marcos doesn’t include everyone who flies out of Manila with the President. There are, of course, the various support staff – those who work for the different Cabinet members, legislators, the Presidential Management Staff, and the Presidential Security Group. The count also does not include the media who fly alongside the President and his delegation on board PR001. They – private media, public media, and Malacañang’s media producers – are referred to as the media delegation. The count also does not include government officials who usually fly in days or even weeks before the President arrives, to coordinate with the host country or organization. And then, of course, there’s the delegation whose ties to the President are clearly personal. The First Couple’s two younger sons – Simon and Vincent – were among those who flew with them to Davos. Simon was also seen in New York during his father’s event at the New York Stock Exchange. Also a prominent name is that of actress Dawn Zulueta, who is married to Secretary Lagdameo. Zulueta joined her husband and the President on the trip to Bangkok for APEC and Davos for WEF. Malacañang also does not publish the names of business executives and leaders who fly in during these summits and meets. In New York for Marcos’ participation in the United Nations General Assembly, for instance, several big names in business led by Private Sector Advisory Council lead Sabin Aboitiz, were there too. They joined the President in his event at the New York Stock Exchange. In Davos, seven Filipino business leaders flew out to “support” the government. The business delegation, said Marcos, fly to whichever part of the world on their own dime. Their arrangements are their own, although they feature prominently in events with Marcos and his economic team, too. “The others that have been accompanying me are actually private sector. They don’t actually fly with me. They go there on their own. Although they are included in our meetings, and they have their own meetings on the sidelines as well,” said Marcos, reacting to criticism over his delegation size. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-faa-revokes-access-system-contractors-involved-computer-outage/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told lawmakers on Wednesday, January 25, that it had revoked access to a pilot messaging database to contractor personnel involved in a file deletion that led to the first nationwide groundstop since 2001. Last week, the FAA said it had found contract personnel “unintentionally deleted files” disrupting the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) messaging system that led to a January 11 groundstop disrupting more than 11,000 flights. It was the first nationwide groundstop since the Septermber 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. The FAA in an email to lawmakers seen by Reuters identified the contractor involved as Bethesda-based Spatial Front. “All personnel from Spatial Front directly involved in the deletion have lost access to FAA buildings and systems while we complete our investigation,” the FAA email to lawmakers said. The company did not respond to an email from Reuters late Wednesday. The NOTAM system provides pilots, flight crews and other users of US airspace with critical safety notices. The FAA said the deletion occurred while personnel were working “to correct synchronization between the live primary database and a backup database.” On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed legislation to establish an FAA task force to improve the NOTAM database. “The recent NOTAM system meltdown highlighted a huge vulnerability in our air transportation system and underscores the need to address the leadership vacuum at FAA,” said House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves. Representative Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the Transportation Committee said “the traveling public should be able to reach their destinations without system outages derailing their flight due to outdated technology.” Separately, Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen plans to meet with lawmakers Thursday, sources told Reuters. The FAA has been without a permanent FAA administrator since late March. Earlier in the day, the FAA said some NOTAM users reported slower response times but said the system remained “online and operational.” US airlines told Reuters they saw no flight impact from any NOTAM issue Wednesday. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/army-takes-custody-jesus-durante-killing-businesswoman-yvonette-chua-plaza/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Army (PA) has taken custody of former Presidential Security Group chief Brigadier General Jesus Durante, the alleged mastermind in the murder of Davao-based businesswoman-model Yvonette Chua Plaza. Army chief Lieutenant General Romeo Brawner Jr. confirmed this in an interview with DZBB on Thursday, January 26, a day after announcing that Durante had been relieved of his post as 1001st Brigade commander. “We do not tolerate these wrongdoings. Whatever the rank, pare-pareho ang treatment natin (we will give the same treatment),” Brawner said. Davao police had earlier linked Durante and seven other individuals, including six army officers, in the killing of Plaza, calling her murder a “crime of passion.” An investigation conducted by local police showed Plaza allegedly had sensitive information against Durante, and had supposedly planned to use it to blackmail the Army general. Brawner said Durante was relieved of his post to ensure impartal investigations into Plaza’s murder. Along with Durante, Brawner said the army also had custody of Colonel Michael Licyayo, who Davao police tagged as an accomplice of Durante. Other army personnel, he added, were under the custody of the Philippine National Police, though the final arrangement in relationto custody was still under discussion with the PNP. Speaking to ANC, Brawner said the military was also conducting a parallel investigation into Durante’s and other army officers’ alleged involvement in the Plaza murder. “We are doing our own investigation and we formed a board of inquiry to look into the truthfulness of the allegations against our officers and enlisted personnel,” he said. While civil cases were ongoing, military proceedings could also proceed. Brawner said he would wait for results of the military’s own probe before deciding on whether to file cases against Durante and other army officers under the military’s own justice system. Results from the probe may be ready as soon as this week, the army chief said. “We have a process in the military justice system where cases will be filed against them under the military justice system…. There will be a court martial and we will have custody over them,” Brawner said. When asked if court martial hearings would tackle administrative aspects of cases filed against army personnel, Brawner said such proceedings will involve the military officers’ rank and benefits. The military will also request civil courts for custody of Durante should a warrant of arrest be issued, Brawner said, to facilitate court martial proceedings. “We are not going to pamper our personnel but instead, we will be following the procedures of the military justice system,” he said. The attack on Plaza, which was caught on CCTV, was carried out by two motorcycle-riding and helmet-wearing gunmen near her rented home in Green Meadows subdivision in Mintal, in Davao City’s Tugbok District, just two nights before New Year’s Eve. Durante earlier caught the attention of police investigators after going on social media to respond to allegations about his alleged involvement in Plaza’s killing. He strongly denied any links to her murder. Brawner also sought to dispel any notion that army generals treated officers in their command as members of a “private army,” though he did not discount the possibility that officers linked to Plaza’s death may have been acting under orders. “First of all, this is not normal. That is why we are saying this is not service-related,” Brawner said, adding that while brigade commanders are entitled to personal staff, “it’s not your private army.” He continued: “We tell our soldiers not to follow illegal orders like killing a person in this case. But then again, this has to be established in court – that aspect they were ordered by General Durante.” – Rappler.com"

With the military’s “eyes in the sky” watching, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the rebels to evade capture. “The technology has improved that much,” said Lieutenant Colonel Christian Uy, commander of the Army’s 58th Infantry Battalion. “Even if the rebels hide in deep mountain gullies, the drones are able to spot them.” Operating out of Lumbia air base in Cagayan de Oro City, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) acquired these state-of-the-art drones from Israel, and they have proven to be a game changer in the fight against the Maoist guerrillas. However, the fight has had its casualties and accidents – a Hermes 900 drone crashed near a popular resort in Baungon town in Bukidnon province, near Cagayan de Oro, on May 28, 2022. No one was hurt. Officials said the intelligence gathered from these drones has been invaluable, allowing the military to launch precise and effective operations against the NPA, crippling its strength from four platoons to just one in Misamis Oriental province alone. “At one point, there were around 100 armed rebel fighters. Now they are down to 20 to 25 fighters and we are hunting them wherever they are,” Uy told Rappler. The military said results are starting to show. On Tuesday, January 24, eight rebels surrendered to the Provincial Peace and Order Council (PPOC) of Misamis Oriental. They said the relentless military operations were the reason for their decision to surrender. “We survived on root crops as our food supply line from the villages was disrupted. We lost the political will and I decided to surrender and go back to my family,” said Jorinelle Remadavia, alias “Rambo,” an NPA political officer who surrendered along with seven others. He said they slept in the mountain gullies by flinging their hammocks on trees to avoid military patrols. Remadavia also admitted that the NPA has lost support from its mass base, and it was one of the major reasons why the rebels were losing the longest insurgency war in Southeast Asia. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/meta-reinstate-donald-trump-facebook-instagram-accounts/,[],"Meta Platforms said Wednesday, January 25, it will reinstate former US President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks, following a two-year suspension after the deadly Capitol Hill riot on January 6, 2021. The restoration of his accounts could provide a boost to Trump, who announced in November he will make another run for the White House in 2024. He has 34 million followers on Facebook and 23 million on Instagram, platforms that are key vehicles for political outreach and fundraising. His Twitter account was restored in November by new owner Elon Musk, though Trump has yet to post there. Free speech advocates say it is appropriate for the public to have access to messaging from political candidates, but critics of Meta have accused the company of lax moderating policies. Meta said in a blog post Wednesday it has “put new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses.” “In the event that Mr. Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation,” wrote Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, in the blog post. The decision, while widely expected, drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. “Facebook has policies but they under-enforce them,” said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. “I worry about Facebook’s capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.” The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern Wednesday over Facebook’s ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election. Others said it was the right decision. Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and a former ACLU official, defended the reinstatement. He had previously endorsed the company’s decision to suspend Trump’s account. “The public has an interest in hearing directly from candidates for political office,” said Jaffer. “It’s better if the major social media platforms err on the side of leaving speech up, even if the speech is offensive or false, so that it can be addressed by other users and other institutions.” The decision to ban Trump was a polarizing one for Meta, the world’s biggest social media company, which prior to the Trump suspension had never blocked the account of a sitting head of state for violating its content rules. The company indefinitely revoked Trump’s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts after removing two of his posts during the Capitol Hill violence, including a video in which he reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. It then referred the case to its independent oversight board, which ruled that the suspension was justified but its indeterminate nature was not. In response, Meta said it would revisit the suspension two years after it began. Meta’s blog post Wednesday suggested it may reactivate other suspended accounts, including those penalized for their involvement in civil unrest. The company said those reinstated accounts would be subject to more stringent review and penalties for violations. Whether, and how, Trump will seize upon the opportunity to return to Facebook and Instagram is unclear. Trump has not sent any new tweets since regaining his account on Twitter, saying he would prefer to stick with his own app Truth Social. But his campaign spokesman told Fox News Digital last week that being back on Facebook “will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump responded to his reinstatement on Meta apps, saying: “Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!” He did not indicate if or when he would begin posting on Meta platforms again. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House Intelligence Committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him. “Trump incited an insurrection,” Schiff wrote on Twitter. “Giving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.” – Rappler.com"

Using its operating cash flow, MONDE will be paying FCG P820,268,295 for its ownership stake, with a price of P1 per share. This is higher than the market price per share of FCG, which closed at P0.89 on Wednesday, January 25. FCG said that it will be using the proceeds from the transaction to “finance its expansion plans.” It currently operates and franchises Figaro Coffee, Angel’s Pizza, Tien Ma’s, and Cafe Portofino. “We welcome this partnership with Monde Nissin as we believe a combination of their leadership in the food sector, strength in manufacturing and timeless brand equity, combined with our fast-growing store network and brand strength will yield excellent opportunities for Figaro Coffee Group to solidify its position as a very strong and stable F&B company,” said FCG’s chairman emeritus Jerry Liu in a joint press release on Thursday. On the other hand, the new ownership stake will allow MONDE to expand into the food service sector. It currently has a strong portfolio in the food and beverage industry, with brands such as Lucky Me! noodles, SkyFlakes crackers, Fita crackers, Monde baked goods, and Quorn meat alternative products. “We are excited with the opportunity to become shareholders in the Figaro Coffee Group as it provides a greater exposure to the food service sector which we view as a potentially attractive avenue for further growth both here in the Philippines and abroad,” said Henry Soesanto, MONDE’s chief executive officer. He also added that MONDE’s ownership in FCG could boost the procurement capabilities of the restaurant and cafe operator as it expands further. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-philippines-q4-2022/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ gross domestic product (GDP) accelerated by 7.6% in 2022, as holiday consumption and further reopening of businesses boosted growth despite prices of goods rising to 14-year highs. The Philippine Statistics Authority on Thursday, January 26, also initially reported that fourth quarter growth hit 7.2%. This was later revised downward to 7.1%, still marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s economic team aimed for GDP to grow between 6.5% and 7.5% in 2022. Among countries in Asia that have reported latest GDP figures, the Philippines grew the fastest, followed by Vietnam with 5.9% growth and China with 2.9%. Main contributors to the annual growth were wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, manufacturing, and construction. Among major economic sectors, agriculture, industry, and services posted growth rates of 0.5%, 6.7%, and 9.2%, respectively. Household consumption grew 8.3%, signaling that families continued to spend despite inflation climbing to 5.8% in 2022. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan attributed economic growth to the country’s high employment rate pushing up consumption despite elevated prices. With inflation eating up household savings and likely causing people to accumulate debt, is this growth sustainable? Balisacan said addressing inflation is the Marcos administration’s top priority for 2023, as elevated prices would “negate what we have achieved in recent years.” “We will continue to support consumers and affected sectors through the extension of reduced tariffs on various products, facilitation of an accessible food supply chain, reduction of transport and logistics costs, and other measures to cushion the impacts of inflation on the purchasing power of households,” he said. For 2023, the government’s economic managers are aiming for GDP growth to settle between 6% and 7%. Economists earlier said emerging markets like the Philippines could take a hit from monetary policy tightening as central banks around the world rein in inflation. GDP growth is the year-on-year change in a country’s economic output which measures how fast an economy is growing. It provides a snapshot of the state of the economy and helps government officials craft policies, but does not reflect other economic indicators like income inequality or the sustainability of growth. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/taylor-swift-concert-fiasco-leads-united-states-senate-grilling-ticketmaster/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA –  US senators slammed Live Nation Entertainment’s lack of transparency and inability to block bot purchases of tickets on Tuesday, January 24, in a hearing called after a major fiasco involving ticket sales for Taylor Swift’s upcoming concert tour. Live Nation Entertainment Inc subsidiary Ticketmaster, which has been unpopular with fans for years, has drawn fresh heat from US lawmakers over how it handled ticket sales last fall for Swift’s Eras tour, her first in five years. Experts say Ticketmaster commands more than 70% market share of primary ticket services for major US concert venues. “We apologize to the fans, we apologize to Ms. Swift, we need to do better and we will do better,” Joe Berchtold, who is president and chief financial officer of Live Nation, told the US Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. “In hindsight there are several things we could have done better – including staggering the sales over a longer period of time and doing a better job setting fan expectations for getting tickets,” Berchtold said. Republican Senator Mike Lee said in an opening statement that the Ticketmaster debacle highlighted the importance of considering whether “new legislation or perhaps just better enforcement of existing laws might be needed to protect the American people.” Senators slammed Berchtold for Live Nation’s fee structure and inability to deal with bots which bulk buy tickets and resell them at inflated prices. “There isn’t transparency when no one knows who sets the fees,” Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said, responding to Berchtold’s claim that Live Nation fees fluctuate based on “ratings.” Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn called Live Nation’s bot problem “unbelievable,” pointing out that much smaller companies are able to limit bad actors in their systems. “You ought to be able to get some good advice from people and figure it out,” she said. “I’m not against big per se, but I am against dumb,” Republican Senator John Kennedy said, referring to Live Nation’s dominance in the ticket sales market. “The way your company handled ticket sales for Ms. Swift was a debacle, and whoever in your company was in charge of that should be fired. “If you care about the consumer, cut the price! Cut out the bots! Cut out the middle people and if you really care about the consumer, give the consumer a break!” Jack Groetzinger, cofounder of ticket sales platform SeatGeek, testified that the process of buying tickets is “antiquated and ripe for innovation” and called for the breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which merged in 2010. “As long as Live Nation remains both the dominant concert promoter and ticketer of major venues in the U.S., the industry will continue to lack competition and struggle,” he told lawmakers. Ticketmaster has argued that the bots used by scalpers were behind the Taylor Swift debacle, and Berchtold asked for more help in fighting the bots that buy tickets for resale. Other witnesses include Jerry Mickelson, president of JAM Productions, who has been among critics of Ticketmaster. In November, Ticketmaster canceled a planned ticket sale to the general public for Swift’s tour after more than 3.5 billion requests from fans, bots and scalpers overwhelmed its website. Senator Klobuchar, who heads the Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, has said the issues that cropped up in November were not new and potentially stemmed from consolidation in the ticketing industry. In November, Ticketmaster denied any anticompetitive practices and noted it remained under a consent decree with the Justice Department following its 2010 merger with Live Nation, adding that there was no “evidence of systemic violations of the consent decree.” A previous Ticketmaster dispute with the Justice Department culminated in a December 2019 settlement extending the consent agreement into 2025. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-stock-markets-currencies-oil-prices-january-25-2023/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – Global equity markets skidded on Wednesday, January 25, as poor corporate results fueled recession fears, as did the ongoing inversion of short- and long-dated Treasury yields – a harbinger of economic downturns. But the main indexes on Wall Street sharply pared losses, suggesting that many believe a downturn, coupled with rising unemployment, will lead the Federal Reserve to back off its aggressive monetary tightening and soon cut interest rates. Short-dated Treasury yields have been inverted, or higher than longer-dated government debt, for some time. The yield curve on 3-month bills and 10-year notes narrowed on Wednesday, but was still deeply inverted at -123.5 basis points. “Every recession has been preceded by some type of yield curve inversion,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief US economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in New York. But with the Fed’s overnight borrowing rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, it is “restrictive” and slowing growth, potentially causing large job losses in the next month or two that will lead the US central bank to cut interest rates by midyear, he said. “I could be right about the economy and the labor market, but the Fed may still say we’re going to drive the economy lower until there’s no fear that inflation is going to kick back up.” Corporate America also signaled trouble ahead. Boeing’s downbeat results on Wednesday amid ongoing supply chain constraints added to slower growth concerns, while Microsoft warned its customers were cautious about spending in an uncertain economy in a lackluster outlook late Tuesday, January 24. Futures are pricing in a 94.7% probability of a 25-basis-point hike when Feb policymakers end a two-day meeting on February 1. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.2 basis points to 3.445%, well below the Fed’s projection that its target rate will stay above 5% into next year. Two out of three Americans say they’re more concerned about paying bills than saving for their financial future, said Johan Grahn, head of ETFs at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis, citing a survey done by his company. While the US central bank will make some changes, “they’re not significant enough to scare the Fed away from its stated marching orders,” Grahn said. “The enemy is inflation, the catalyst is the labor market, and that’s the bottom line.” Wall Street closed little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, the S&P 500 slid 0.02%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.18% after losses of more than 2% earlier. Trade in European stocks was lackluster, as signs of an improving economic outlook in the eurozone fed worries about further rate hikes. The broad pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.29% and MSCI’s gauge of global stock performance closed up 0.05% to eke out a fresh five-month closing high after trading much lower most of the day. Markets have been buffeted by the fastest tightening of monetary policy since the 1980s. The Bank of Canada signaled it would likely halt further hikes after lifting its key interest rate to 4.5% on Wednesday. Earlier the Australian dollar hit a five-month high as rising inflation data bolstered the case for another rate increase from the Reserve Bank of Australia next month. The Canadian dollar fell 0.11% versus the greenback at 1.34 per dollar after the central bank’s outlook. The Australian dollar surged to $0.7123 after the latest inflation data. Australia’s currency is up 1.6% this week and is poised for its biggest weekly gain in more than two months. The euro rose 0.26% to $1.0913. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a seven-month high. Trading volume was depressed as Chinese and Taiwanese markets were still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Data showing German business morale brightened in January did little to push the single currency higher for now. Germany’s Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 90.2, in line with the consensus, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, and up from 88.6 in December. Oil prices settled largely unchanged after government data showed a smaller-than-anticipated build in US crude inventories, countering weak economic data from Tuesday. Brent crude futures settled at $86.12 a barrel, down a cent, while the US West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $80.15 a barrel, down by two cents. Gold reversed course to edge up as the dollar weakened and investors kept a close eye on a slew of upcoming US economic data that could influence the Fed’s policy meeting next week. US gold futures settled up 0.4% to $1,942.60 an ounce. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/asha-wolf-captured-united-states-shipped-mexico/,[],"NEW MEXICO, USA – Environmentalists on Wednesday, January 25, protested US government plans to transfer an endangered Mexican gray wolf captured in New Mexico to Mexico, saying it should be allowed to roam free and repopulate the Rockies. The she-wolf, named Asha by schoolchildren, was captured near Taos, New Mexico, on Sunday, January 22, after heading further north than any other Mexican wolf recorded since the species’ 1998 reintroduction after near extinction. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) said its policy was to capture and transfer the wolves once they left a recovery area and trekked north of I40, the interstate highway running through the upper half of New Mexico. Environmentalists said the wolves needed to enter historic habitats north of I40 like the Grand Canyon and Southern Rockies for their US population to further recover from a current level of around 200 in the wild. Ranchers have long complained the wolves eat their livestock and endanger their livelihoods. The species’ recovery has been hampered by hundreds of illegal and legal killings, the Sierra Club says. “The Fish and Wildlife Service has pledged, by regulation, to remove all wolves north of Interstate 40, on behalf of the livestock industry,” said Michael Robinson, senior conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. The tagged wolf left her pack in late 2022 and was tracked north, making it within 50 miles (81 km) of the Colorado border before being apprehended from a helicopter. “As it is breeding season and there are no other known wolves in the area, there was a high likelihood of a negative interaction or breeding with domestic dogs,” USFWS said in a statement. Asha will be held at a facility south of Albuquerque before being paired with a male Mexican wolf and transferred as a pair to Mexico later this year, USFWS said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/immigrant-farm-worker-charged-murders-half-moon-bay-california-shooting/,[],"CALIFORNIA, USA – An immigrant farm worker was formally charged with premeditated murder on Wednesday in the fatal shooting of seven co-workers near San Francisco, the state’s second deadly gun rampage just two days apart that claimed a total of 18 lives. Chunli Zhao, 66, a Chinese citizen and the lone suspect in Monday’s massacre at two mushroom farms in the seaside town of Half Moon Bay, was formally presented with seven counts of murder and a single count of attempted murder during his first court appearance in nearby Redwood City. Zhao, wearing red-colored jail garb and enclosed behind a glass panel, was ordered held without bond during a brief hearing before a San Mateo County Superior Court judge. The pudgy defendant, with close-cropped gray hair, was expressionless through the hearing. He was assigned two private defense lawyers; no plea was entered. The next court proceeding in the case was set for February 16. A Mandarin-language translator was provided for the defendant, who according to District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe is a Chinese citizen who has resided in the United States for at least 10 years. After the hearing, Wagstaffe told reporters outside the courthouse that prosecutors have not yet determined Zhao’s precise immigration status, or whether he entered the country legally. The prosecutor said authorities do have an idea about the suspect’s motives but declined to share any details. Wagstaffe also revealed the existence of one tantalizing clue, saying a note was found inside Zhao’s car, though he declined to disclose what it said. The district attorney said Zhao was “cooperative with sheriff’s detectives” who initially interviewed him through a Mandarin interpreter, without an attorney present, following his arrest and that he gave “a complete statement.” Still, the expectation is that Zhao will enter a not-guilty plea as the proceedings progress, “and we want to make sure this man gets a fair trial,” Wagstaffe said. In addition to eight felony counts, the 10-page criminal complaint alleges “special circumstances,” accusing Zhao of “personally and intentionally” shooting to kill. Under California law, defendants convicted of murder with “special circumstances” can be eligible for the death penalty, though Governor Gavin Newsom in 2019 declared a moratorium on executions. The state has not put a condemned inmate to death since 2006. Otherwise, the maximum sentence is life in prison without the possibility of parole, Wagstaffe said. Late on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris paid a condolence visit to the Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park, where 11 people were killed in a separate rampage at a ballroom dance hall on Saturday night by a gunman who later took his own life. Harris, a California native, laid flowers at a memorial set up outside the dance studio, and in brief comments to reporters called for Congress to enact tougher national gun-safety measures. She then met privately with victims’ families. California’s firearm laws are among the strictest in the country, and the two shootings, coming in quick succession, left the state reeling from one of the bloodiest spates of mass gun violence in decades. Authorities said each of the two killing sprees represented the single greatest loss of life from a single act of violence in Los Angeles and San Mateo counties. Asked if investigators believed the Half Moon Bay killings were a “copy-cat” crime inspired by the shooting rampage in Monterey Park two days earlier, Wagstaffe said flatly, “No.” Zhao was taken into custody on Monday evening outside a sheriff’s station, where police said he had driven shortly after the attack on farm workers. The precise motive for the shooting remained unclear. Zhao had been employed by one of the growers, Mountain Mushroom Farm, and had resided at the property along with some other employees, according to farm owner California Terra Gardens. Authorities said early evidence indicated the bloodshed stemmed from a workplace grievance. The second crime scene, Concord Farms, is about a mile away. Sheriff Christina Corpus said in a CNN interview that the gunman “went after and pursued” specific victims, even though he had the chance to hurt others and that he was a “co-worker or former co-worker” of the victims at both shooting sites. She said Zhao was not known to law enforcement before Monday’s bloodshed. CNN and other media outlets have reported Zhao was the subject of a temporary restraining order after a former co-worker accused him of attacking and threatening him in 2013. Half Moon Bay, a town of 12,000 residents south of San Francisco, is home to both a luxury resort and a low-income farming community. The shooting cast a renewed spotlight on hardships faced by the area’s farm workers, many of them immigrants from Latin America and Asia who often live in squalid labor encampments and toil long hours under poor conditions for extremely low pay. The killings there unfolded two days after a gunman 380 miles to the south opened fire at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a club frequented mostly by older patrons of Asian descent in Monterey Park. In addition to the 11 people killed, nine were injured in Saturday night’s gunfire. Authorities said the assailant, Huu Can Tran, 72, drove a short time later to a second dance hall, where that club’s operator disarmed him before he could open fire. The next morning, Tran shot himself to death behind the wheel of his vehicle as police closed in on him south of Los Angeles. Although his motive remained unclear, Tran was a known regular of the Star Ballroom. A tenant of a Los Angeles-rental property he owned suggested that Tran may have been nursing a grudge against other patrons. Both rampages were notable for the suspects’ age, much older than typical in deadly mass shootings that have grown all too commonplace in the United States. Authorities said the both gunmen used a semi-automatic pistol, and the victims in each case came from immigrant communities. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/news-corp-investors-cheer-rupert-murdoch-decision-scrap-tie-up-fox/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – Large shareholders in News Corp on Wednesday, January 25, applauded Rupert Murdoch’s decision to withdraw a proposal to reunite the owner of Dow Jones and Fox, as News Corp decided to pursue a sale of Move instead. News Corp is in talks to sell Move, which operates the Realtor.com website, to CoStar Group, the company said on Tuesday, January 24, confirming an earlier Reuters report. On Wednesday afternoon, News Corp shares were up over 5%, paring some earlier gains, as shareholders hailed the decision to abandon the deal with Fox to instead pursue the sale of Move at a significant premium to what News Corp first paid for the company it bought in 2014. News Corp bought Move for about $1 billion in 2014. It is in talks to sell the stake in Move for more than $3 billion, Reuters has reported. Since the move to renuite Fox and News Corp was first announced in October last year, a number of large shareholders on both sides had opposed the deal. T. Rowe Price, the biggest investor in News Corp with a roughly 12% stake, had previously expressed concerns that the deal would undervalue News Corp. On Wednesday, portfolio manager Vincent DeAugustino cheered News Corp’s decision to scrap the deal. “We applaud the decision to forgo such a transaction as News Corp considers other options to unlock value,” he said in a statement. On Tuesday, activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which had also opposed the proposed reunion of Fox and News Corp, applauded the decision to not move forward. Cowen & Co.’s Doug Creutz said investors were pleased by the decision to walk away from a potential combination, saying that pressure from investors like T. Rowe Price weighed on Murdoch’s decision to pursue the deal. A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders. Fox shares were up about 2% on Wednesday. While News Corp’s decision to sell Move has been positively received, questions now remain on the future of the company’s non-media assets, which include its stake in Australian real estate company REA Group Ltd. “The other big question is – does News Corp give their shareholders their pro-rata shares of REA in addition to selling Move? That would clean out the real estate holdings of the company and simplify the structure of News Corp, which is greatly needed as the company is overly complicated,” said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/boeing-earnings-report-q4-2022/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – Boeing losses widened for 2022 on weakness in its defense unit as it warned of further supply chain issues, but the US planemaker reported its first yearly positive cash flow since 2018. The US planemaker missed Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share in the final quarter of the year. Boeing shares, which have risen by more than 70% since September, fell 1% Wednesday, January 25. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun told analysts the planemaker still faces “a difficult, difficult supply chain and while average deliveries met our objectives, we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines…. So those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be.” Chief financial officer Brian West said the company was increasing its abnormal accounting estimate by about $600 million as it expects 787 production to remain lower for “a bit longer than expected due to a supplier constraint,” but still expects to raise its production rate to five per month later this year. Boeing affirmed plans to deliver up to 450 737 MAX narrowbody aircraft and 70 to 80 widebody 787 Dreamliners in 2023. The company reiterated it expects to generate $3 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Those numbers do not include the much-anticipated restart of Boeing jetliner deliveries to China. Calhoun declined to comment on when Chinese airlines could begin accepting aircraft from Boeing. “Within China, they need the MAX to fly to satisfy those demands,” said Calhoun, who called the potential opening of the Chinese market a “serious bump” for the entire aviation industry. Boeing previously expressed interest in remarketing a portion of the Chinese 737 MAX planes, but Calhoun said Wednesday Boeing would “pause” its efforts “so that we can discern what China wants to do.” China Southern Airlines began flying the 737 MAX earlier this month after an almost four-year pause. About 138 of the 200 737 MAX planes in storage are meant for Chinese customers. The supply chain issues come as Boeing is working to stabilize and ramp up production. Third Bridge analyst Peter McNally said Boeing in 2022 was “showing some significant progress in key areas, although the reported financial results were mixed.” Boeing said net losses rose to $5 billion for all of 2022 from $4.3 billion in 2021, while losses from operations rose to $3.5 billion in 2022 from $2.9 billion. Boeing generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the final quarter of 2022. It had forecast about $2.5 billion in free cash flow for the fourth quarter. Boeing reported $2.3 billion for all of 2022. Boeing reported fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion, up from $14.79 billion in 2022, and a loss per share of $1.75. Boeing had been expected to report $20.38 billion in revenue in the quarter and a gain of 26 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data. While supply chain bottlenecks could continue to be a struggle for the aerospace industry at large, McNally pointed out that jetliner demand from airlines remains strong and Boeing has demonstrated an improved ability to ramp up deliveries. “We haven’t had a hiccup in some time in the supply chain and deliveries are directionally improving, and they affirmed the [delivery] guidance,” he said. “As of right now…I don’t really have a good reason to doubt their ability to hit these numbers because customer demand is there.” Last month, Boeing won approval from Congress to lift a deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of 737 MAX aircraft. Without a waiver, the planemaker had said the MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes were at risk. Calhoun said he thinks the MAX 7 will have its first flights this year and the MAX 10 “probably” next year. Congress said Boeing must retrofit existing MAX airplanes with safety enhancements as part of that waiver. West said the provision to account for retrofits costs was “small.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/michelle-williams-playing-steven-spielberg-mother-the-fabelmans/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Michelle Williams won critical acclaim for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s autobiographical coming-of-age drama, The Fabelmans, and her portrayal of the director’s mother secured her a best actress Oscar nomination on Tuesday, January 24. Co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner, the movie is set in the 1950s and 60s and follows the fictional character Sammy Fabelman, based on Spielberg as a young man, as he falls in love with the moving pictures and discovers a family secret that changes the way he views the world. Williams and Paul Dano play Sammy’s mother Mitzi and father Burt, inspired by Spielberg’s parents, the late Leah Adler and Arnold Spielberg. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month, Williams spoke about the role, seeing an emotional Spielberg on set and awards season. Below are excerpts, edited for length and clarity. Q: What was it like to essentially play Steven Spielberg’s mother and take on this high energy role? Williams: “Very high energy! Honestly, it was a beautiful thing to inhabit for a period of time. I loved being her. I loved burning that brightly and having that much to give, to the point I really missed her… when it was all over.” Q: As a mother and artist, how much did your character Mitzi and Spielberg’s mother Leah Adler resonate with you? Williams: “She really did and she continues to honestly, the way that she was an artist. She was an incredible pianist, could have been a concert pianist, could have travelled the world. But she used all of that energy and she put it into her family and she made her family this huge creative act. She made their childhoods so full of imagination and whimsy and play and joy and fun.” Q: I understand Spielberg got quite emotional when she saw you and Paul Dano on set in character as his parents? Williams: “It’s such an interesting moment because here’s this man in front of you weeping because he’s so moved to see the presence of his parents again, which is really why he made the movie, because he loved them so much and he wanted to bring them back and honor them and tell their story. So your heart goes out to him because he’s emotional, but also inside, as an actor, you’re thinking: ‘Oh, thank God, like, it’s working. We’re on the right track’.” Q: There’s a lot of excitement over your performance. How do you approach awards season at this stage of your career? Williams: “You make your work because you want people to see it and you want them to connect to it and so when something connects like this, it’s really rewarding.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-26-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Russia sent Ukrainian civilians racing for cover with a rush-hour missile barrage, killing at least one person, the day after Kyiv secured Western pledges of dozens of modern battlefield tanks to try to push back the Russian invasion. Moscow reacted with fury to the German and American announcements, and has in the past responded to apparent Ukrainian successes with massed air strikes that have left millions without light, heat or water. The Ukrainian military said it had shot down all 24 drones sent overnight by Russia, including 15 around the capital, and 47 of 55 Russian missiles – some fired from Tu-95 strategic bombers in the Russian Arctic. Air raid alarms had sounded across Ukraine as people headed to work. In the capital, crowds took cover for a time in underground metro stations. Kyiv city officials said a 55-year-old man had been killed and two wounded. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said electricity substations had been hit as Russia continued to target energy facilities. The Kremlin said it saw the promised delivery of Western tanks as evidence of the growing “direct involvement” of the United States and Europe in the 11-month old conflict , something both deny. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy producer, said it was conducting pre-emptive emergency shutdowns in Kyiv, the surrounding region and the regions of Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk. In Odesa, the Black Sea port designated a “World Heritage in Danger” site on Wednesday by the UN cultural agency UNESCO, Russian missiles damaged energy facilities, authorities said, just as French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna was arriving. Colonna was due to meet her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, to discuss humanitarian and military aid and potentially whether France might join its NATO allies in supplying Ukraine with battle tanks, in this case its own Leclerc model. Both Moscow and Kyiv, which have so far relied on Soviet-era T-72 tanks, are expected to mount new ground offensives in spring. Ukraine has been asking for hundreds of modern tanks in the hope of using them to break Russian defensive lines and recapture occupied territory in the south and east. “The key now is speed and volumes. Speed in training our forces, speed in supplying tanks to Ukraine. The numbers in tank support,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address on Wednesday. “We have to form such a ‘tank fist’, such a ‘fist of freedom’.” Maintaining Kyiv’s drumbeat of requests, Zelenskiy said he had spoken to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and asked for long-range missiles and aircraft. Ukraine’s allies have already provided billions of dollars in military aid, including sophisticated US missile systems that have helped turn the tide of the war. The United States has been wary of deploying its difficult-to-maintain M1 Abrams tanks, but ultimately promised 31 to persuade Germany to pledge its more easily operated German-built Leopards. Germany will initially send 14 tanks from its inventory and approve shipments by allied European states, with the ultimate aim of equipping two battalions – in the region of 100 tanks. It said its Leopards should be operational in three to four months, and Britain said on Thursday it expected the 14 Challenger tanks it is sending to be in Ukraine in two months. But analysts said Ukrainian commanders can already be less cautious in deploying tanks they have, knowing that replacements are coming. The Leopard is a system that any NATO member can service, and crews and mechanics can be trained together, Ukrainian military expert Viktor Kevlyuk told Espreso TV. “If we have been brought into this club by providing us with these vehicles, I would say our prospects look good.” Since invading Ukraine on February 24 last year, Russia has shifted its emphasis from “denazifying” and “demilitarizing” its neighbor to confronting a purportedly aggressive and expansionist US-led NATO alliance. Nikolai Patrushev, close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and secretary of his Security Council, was quoted as saying that “even with the end of the ‘hot phase’ of the conflict in Ukraine, the Anglo-Saxon world will not stop the proxy war against Russia and its allies”. The Russian invasion has killed thousands of civilians, forced millions from their homes and reduced entire cities to rubble, while spurring Sweden and Russia’s neighbor Finland to apply to join NATO. Bakhmut, a town in eastern Ukraine with a pre-war population of 70,000, has seen some of the bloodiest combat of the war. Ukraine’s military said Russia was attacking “with the aim of capturing the entire Donetsk region, with no regard for its own casualties”. The Russian-installed governor of Donetsk said on Wednesday that units of Russia’s Wagner contract militia were moving forward inside Bakhmut, with fighting on the outskirts and in neighborhoods recently held by Ukraine. However, the US-based non-profit Institute for the Study of War said attacks on Bakhmut appeared to have stalled as Russia directed conventional forces to the north, trying to complete the seizure of Ukraine’s Luhansk province. – Rappler.com"

The survey questioned individuals on whether they believe their quality of life changed in the last three months of 2022. They were asked: “Kung ikukumpara ang uri ng inyong kasalukuyang pamumuhay sa nakaraang 12 buwan, masasabi ba niyo na ang uri ng inyong pamumuhay ay…mas mabuti ngayon kaysa noon (‘gainer’), kapareho ng dati, o mas masama ngayon kaysa noon (‘loser’)?” (If you were to compare the quality of your life in the past 12 months, would you say your quality of life has improved, is same as before, or worse than before?) The national survey was taken between December 10 and 14, 2022. The Philippines recorded 8.1% inflation in December and 5.8% for the whole 2022. (READ: 3 in 10 Filipinos say quality of life improved in the past 12 months – SWS) At least 26% said life got worse in 2022 (“losers”), while 39% said it remained unchanged. This is an improvement from the SWS’ October survey, where 29% of respondents said life got worse . “Net Gainers was a very high +10 among the Not Hungry families, compared to the fair -7 among the Overall Hungry, fair -4 among the Moderately Hungry, and low -21 among the Severely Hungry families,” the SWS said in its report. However, net gainers increased among those who self-rated poor. “Compared to October 2022, the Net Gainers score stayed very high among the Not Poor, hardly moving from +14 to +15. It rose from high to very high among the Borderline Poor, moving from +6 to +16. It rose from fair to high among the Poor, up slightly from -9 to +1,” the polling outfit added. “The Net Gainer score was generally negative until 2015, when it rose to positive numbers until the drastic deterioration beginning with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It has since trended back upwards but still has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels,” SWS said. People in all regions believed their quality of life improved in the last quarter of 2022. Among the regions, most of those who felt like life improved were in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, and Mindanao, while most in the Visayas rated quality of life as “fair” between October and December 2022. During this period, the ratings increased in balance Luzon by two points from +8 to +10. It rose from mediocre to fair in the Visayas, up by 9 points from -13 to -4. It rose most dramatically in Mindanao from mediocre to very high, up by 21 points from -11 to +10. This latest survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews of 1,200 adults nationwide, 300 in each region. The population sampling was based on the Philippine Statistics Authority medium-population projections for 2022. – Rappler.com"

A report issued by Central Luzon regional police on January 23 said William Reed, 57, was arrested in Poblacion in Pulilan town during a manhunt operation. The operation was carried out by cops from the regional office, as well as from the town. According to the police, Reed was arrested through a warrant of arrest for “double murder under Criminal Case No. 01-191969 issued by Judge Rodolfo A. Ponferrada, dated May 25, 2001 with no recommended bail.” The police added that Reed was part of the Department of the Interior and Local Government’s list of most wanted persons in the country. Reed carried P250,000 bounty, the police added. The arrested former cop is only one in the long list of people implicated in the double murder case. He has been in hiding since 2001 – or for 22 years – since the charge was filed against him and his companions. At the time of the murders, Reed held the rank of Senior Police Officer 1, or Police Master Sergeant in today’s classification of police ranks. In the early 2000s, the murder of public relations man Salvador “Buddy” Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito shocked the country after the names of some powerful politicians back then were dragged into the case. It included the likes of former president Joseph Estrada and former national police chief and senator Panfilo Lacson. Dacer and Corbito were brutally murdered shortly after Dacer was summoned in Malacañang where he was accused of lobbying for the impeachment of Estrada, who was then the president. Dacer also served as publicist to Estrada prior to his murder. On November 24, 2000, the two were abducted in an intersection along Makati City. A few months later, in April 2001, their burned remains were found in a creek in Cavite. Their bodies were identified using dental records and personal items. The case ran for years, and some of the petitions even reached the Supreme Court. Although the court later dismissed the case against Lacson, the former senator said he believed the double murder was a plot against him by former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Lacson had accused the ex-president of corruption.

Back then, Lacson was among Estrada’s favorite generals. Meanwhile, in 2020, one of the former cops tagged in the case, Cezar Mancao II, was appointed by former president Rodrigo Duterte as head of the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center. Mancao, who used to be under the Witness Protection Program, testified against Estrada and Lacson during the trial. – Rappler.com"

Serving as a stand-in for Chot Reyes, Lastimosa guided TNT to a victorious PBA Governors’ Cup debut following a 123-119 win over Phoenix on Wednesday, January 25. “I want to be good at both. I think it can be done,” said the PBA legend, who won 10 championships as a player and three titles as an assistant coach at Alaska. Lastimosa admitted it was particularly difficult in the past couple of months as he oversaw the signing of fresh player deals. He was also responsible for bringing in import Jalen Hudson, who finished with a near triple-double of 34 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists in his debut for the Tropang Giga. With Hudson already on board, Lastimosa still needs to find a second reinforcement for the East Asia Super League Champions Week to be held in Japan in March. “It was tough, but now, it is a little bit easier. But I still sign papers these days,” said Lastimosa. “Sometimes, I need to delegate a little bit more, but I want to be hands-on on both.” While the juggling act may be challenging, the 58-year-old mentor is pleased with the plethora of talent he has at his disposal. “I’m fortunate because I already have a team that is built to win. It is just a matter of utilizing my coaches about how we want to attack this game collectively and how to make the players listen to our voices,” Lastimosa said. Lastimosa, though, made it clear he is just filling the void left by Reyes, who will focus on his job as Gilas Pilipinas head coach with the FIBA World Cup drawing near. He also took over the coaching reins at his former team NLEX whenever former Road Warriors head coach Yeng Guiao missed games. “I’m still pitching in.

It marked the 44th time that Djokovic reached the last four at the Grand Slams, leaving him six ahead of Rafa Nadal and only two behind his other great rival and 20-time major champion Roger Federer. “I can’t be happier with my tennis, I was solid from the back of the court. I love these conditions, this court, it’s definitely special for me,” Djokovic said. Djokovic targeted Rublev’s forehand and second serve with venomous returns in windy conditions at Rod Laver Arena and went ahead 3-1 in the first set after the Russian fifth seed double-faulted on breakpoint and the Serbian pulled away from there. “You have to make adjustments and adapt,” Djokovic said of playing in testing conditions. “It wasn’t breezy at six in the evening and it started all of a sudden. “People in the stands or watching on TV don’t see it. But it makes a huge difference, as you have to pick and choose your shots and open up the court. The ball toss is a gamble. “The scoreline in the opening two sets does not show the reality. Andrey’s a great opponent, he has one of the biggest forehands. I knew the game plan, but it’s one thing to imagine and another to execute.” After taking the lead in the match with a brilliant backhand crosscourt winner, Djokovic showed how hard he is to beat on the grandest stage despite a strapped thigh due to a hamstring issue after the fourth seed broke in the fifth game of the second set. He played exquisitely to save a breakpoint in the next game and let out a huge roar before going on to double his advantage in the contest after a frustrated Rublev unloaded on his coach in the stands following another double fault.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/dela-rosa-irked-department-national-defense-response-mandatory-rotc/,['BONZ MAGSAMBOL'],"MANILA, Philippines – Concluding that the Department of National Defense (DND) was not keen on taking the lead in running a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) mandatory program for college students, an annoyed Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa suggested to drop discussing the matter altogether. The senator was irked during a Senate hearing Wednesday, January 25, by the response of a defense official, who implied that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) may not be ready for the enormous task. In his reality check, DND Undersecretary Franco Nemesio Gacal said that to implement a mandatory ROTC, the military would need to tap 9,000 to 10,000 personnel for about 2,400 colleges and universities. “Pabor po kami sa mandatory ROTC program [but] certain critical requirements must be addressed. Kung i-implement natin ang basic ROTC program na mandatory, kaya ba ng AFP? Kapag sinabi natin na kaya ng AFP, we talk about manpower, we talk about financial resources, we talk about logistics and facilities,” Gacal said. (We are in favor of mandatory ROTC program but certain requirements must be addressed. If we’re gong to implement the basic mandatory ROTC, can the AFP do it? When we say, AFP’s capability, we talk about manpower, we talk about financial services, we talk about logistics and facilities.) “To run this program, the requirement is enormous. Let’s say, we have about 2,400 HEIs (higher education institutions), if you will put four personnel, you need 9,000 to 10,000 people. You need 10,000 military personnel to run this program,” he added. Gacal was keeping it real, but Dela Rosa would not have any of it. The senator, who was a former chief of the Philippine National Police and was a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy, said he did not like the attitude of the DND official. “Kung ganoon ang attitude ng defense establishment natin, i-hinto na natin ito. Balik na tayo sa NSTP (National Service Training Program), kapag ganoon ang gusto ‘nyo. Pinag-uusapan natin ‘to ROTC, ROTC, tapos kayo pala sa defense, ayaw pala ‘nyo,” Dela Rosa said. (If our defense establishment has this kind of attitude, we just stop this. Let’s go back to NSTP if that’s what you want. We’re talking about ROTC, then you there at the defense unit, is not in favor of it.) “Gusto n’yo pala ibigay ang trabaho sa CHED (Commission on Higher Education), sa TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority). Huwag na, tama na ito. Tama na ang usapan natin dito. Ayaw ‘nyo pala i-karga sa shoulders ‘nyo ang trabaho ng ROTC…. parang lukewarm kayo rito, nagdadalawang isip kayo, balik na lang tayo sa NSTP,” the senator said. (You want to give the work to CHED, and TESDA. Let’s stop this. Let’s stop the discussion. You don’t want to put the ROTC work in your shoulders. You’re lukewarm about this, having second thoughts. Let’s go back to NSTP instead.) Currently a voluntary college program designed to produce military reservists, ROTC was previously a requirement at the college level. The government scrapped it in 2002 when an investigation on the 2001 murder of a University of Santo Tomas student found that the victim had exposed alleged corruption in the program. In December, the House of Representatives passed a bill seeking to compel college students to undergo a two-year mandatory National Citizens Service Training (NCST), instead of ROTC. The NCST’s curriculum will be focused on disaster response and management, survival and safety techniques, and civic duty inculcation. Its graduates will be incorporated in the AFP Reserve Force. The proposal also seeks to institutionalize the four-year optional ROTC program, with a curriculum to be designed by the DND and the CHED. CHED, which presented the idea to the Senate in November, described the proposed NCST as a “consensus bill” that would capture the intent of the President’s legislative priority to reform the National Service Training Program and revive the ROTC program. But the version discussed in the Senate on Wednesday was different. The Senate version proposed to make ROTC mandatory for college students. In a tweet on Tuesday, January 24, the party-list Kabataan expressed its strong opposition on the Senate version of the bill, saying that its curriculum was focused on police and military training. Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte earlier expressed hopes that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr would include mandatory ROTC in his legislative agenda. During his first State of the Nation Address, Marcos included a mandatory ROTC among his legislative agenda. The Vice President’s push for mandatory ROTC has also been met with criticism, with activist groups saying compulsory military service sends a strong message that “any dissent will be met with force.” – Rappler.com"

In this series, Rappler revisits some of those who were left behind – to listen and retell their stories – as they seek justice in the face of continuing fear and challenges post-Duterte. First of 4 parts MANILA, Philippines – August 5, 2017 should have been just another ordinary day for Lisa*. She would wake up early to tend to her longtime partner, Paolo, and their three young children, in their small house in one of the busiest and most populous districts in Metro Manila. Paolo, the main breadwinner of their small family, would then go out to work driving a tricycle through busy roads and picking up and dropping off passengers going about their equally ordinary lives. It’s not big money, but enough for their daily necessities. When times got rough, Paolo took on side gigs. Lisa, a hard worker through and through, complements the household’s income by working a job that earns her P5,000 a month. This was the couple’s routine that worked for so long. Paolo and Lisa always found ways to overcome challenges, especially financial ones. They had each other, they had their children, they were able to eat three times a day. That’s not an easy feat in a country where almost 20 million people live below the poverty line, barely able to afford to eat, let alone live comfortably. On August 5, 2017, Lisa woke up around three in the morning, hours earlier than usual. Paolo was not yet at home after visiting a friend the night before. It was a first sign of what eventually would be their upended lives. The children – then aged 7, 9 and 12 – would later wake up without a father. And Lisa, a single mother. All because on June 30, 2016, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte was sworn into the presidency. His violent rhetoric was woven into the national fabric and largely accepted, if not tolerated. “Kung hindi siya naging presidente, hindi siya nagsalita sa harap ng publiko na papatayin ko kayong lahat, na uubusin ko kayo in six months, siguro walang nangyaring ganitong gulo,” Lisa told Rappler in an interview on Monday, January 16. “Sana hindi namatay ang asawa ko, sana kasama pa rin namin siya, at sana may katuwang pa ako sa pagpapalaki sa mga anak namin,” she added. (If he didn’t become president, didn’t speak publicly about wanting to kill people, promising to erase them in six months, perhaps all this mess wouldn’t have happened. My partner wouldn’t have died and he would have still been with us, and he would have continued helping me raise our children.) Paolo was added to the list of more than 3,451 people killed in police operations by the end of July 2017, or roughly a week before his death. By May 2022, a month before Duterte left office, this number would blow up to at least 6,252 individuals, excluding those killed vigilante-style which human rights groups estimate to be at least between 27,000 to 30,000. There are always two narratives emerging from each police operation that turned deadly under Duterte’s anti-illegal drug campaign. Police often hid behind the claim of self-defense. The suspect, the target of their late-night operation, allegedly had a gun and was hell-bent on resisting arrest. If the cops were to be believed, they had no choice but to fight back to save their lives. But as more bodies piled up, the self-defense claim further unraveled, as investigated by various independent bodies. The Commission on Human Rights found “abuse of strength” and “intent to kill” by police in the cases they investigated. Even the Department of Justice-led panel even said that records they reviewed showed that police did not follow protocols in anti-drug operations, further denting the narrative of authorities. It was not so different for Paolo, according to Lisa. Police said that he ran back to his friend’s house, retrieved a gun from under a bed, and shot at them. Witnesses, however, remembered the night quite differently. It was close to midnight, the end of another busy work week for many who strive to make ends meet. The streets were still full of people gossiping with friends, when cops not wearing their uniforms allegedly surrounded the neighborhood. They ordered everyone to their homes. Like clockwork, like they’ve been doing this for so long, the residents followed, shutting behind them their doors and windows. They knew all too well what was about to happen. It was a common sight, after all, ever since Duterte took office. They knew that whoever was in that house, the target of that night’s police operation, would not come out alive. “Narinig daw nila ang asawa ko na nagmamakaawa na huwag siyang patayin kasi may tatlo pa siyang anak na maliliit pa,” she recalled the neighbors telling them. “Pero nakarinig na sila ng isang putok, alam na nila na patay na, tapos may mga sumunod pa na mga putok.” (They heard my husband begging for his life, telling the police that he still has three young children. But then they heard a gunshot, and they knew he was dead, then another round of gunshots.) Paolo was shot three times – two in the head, and one on his chest. He died on the spot. It took a few hours before Lisa knew what happened to the father of her children. She ran from her home to the scene of the crime, where hostility from the police welcomed her. There were a lot of things Lisa will never forget from that night while being stricken with grief. She remembered seeing the new and shiny gun that the police claimed to be Paolo’s. It angered her because she knew it was a complete lie. She remembered a cop folding a piece of paper – allegedly the list of that night’s targets – believing her partner’s name was not there in the first place. Then there was the overheard conversation between the police and someone from the Scene of Crime Operations (SOCO). “Sinabi noong isang taga-SOCO sa pulis: ‘Ano ba iyan, hindi pa kami tapos sa kabila, sunod-sunod naman kayo’,” Lisa recalled. “Grabe ano, hindi pa nila tapos imbestigahan iyong mga patayan sa ibang lugar, tatakbo naman sila dito sa nangyari sa asawa ko.” (Someone from SOCO told a cop: We aren’t even done with the other one but you’re doing operations one after another. It’s intense how they run to other areas like what they did with my husband when they haven’t even finished investigating the killings in other areas.) Any death brings permanent changes to the lives of those left behind. As writer Joan Didion put it in her book about grief: “A single person is missing for you, and the whole world is empty.” But for families of the slain, those whose lives were cut short by violence, the world is both empty and cruel. Lisa grappled with a lot of challenges that made even getting the most basic documents difficult. She and Paolo were not married, a detail that was often used by police to ignore her, so his eldest sibling had to be present whenever she went to police stations. Together, they tried to question what the police claimed happened that night. But they were told everything was in order, and that authorities have all the evidence to prove that Paolo indeed fought back. “Gusto ko lamang may makulong, gusto ko lang naman may managot, pero hindi ko na siya nailaban sa korte kasi nga nakikiusap kami sa mga nakakita na baka puwede silang magsalita kaso ayaw nilang humarap, takot rin sila,” she said. (I just want someone to be jailed, to be held accountable for what they did, but I was unable to fight this in court because witnesses refused to come forward and talk, even if we begged them to, because they were also afraid.) If it was only up to Lisa, she wouldn’t think twice going against the police’s narrative. She’s certain that Paolo did not have a gun, much less knew how to use one. When they saw a photo of the crime scene, Lisa noticed that the gun was on the right hand of Paolo. She knew him for more than a decade, and being left-handed was one of his unique traits. But their priority was to bring home Paolo’s body from the morgue, to raise enough money to afford a proper wake and burial for the family’s main breadwinner. The more they antagonize the police, the less likely they are to release documents that would help them get financial assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and Development. Lisa also had to face the reality that the cops who killed Paolo were likely still stationed in their community. She couldn’t risk losing her life. She didn’t want her children to wake up one morning as orphans, reliving the day they lost their father. “Iyong takot nangibabaw kasi baka sundan kami kasi noong panahon na nakaburol ang asawa ko, ang daming umiikot na sa paligid namin na mga police mobile pero dati walang ganoon,” she recalled. (Fear was overwhelming because we were scared they would come after us. There were so many police mobiles going around during my husband’s wake. That wasn’t the case before.) The burial of Paolo did not stop the challenges Lisa and her family had to face. As mourners return to their own lives, Lisa has to live with the fact that she’s a single mother, left to raise three children. The second child was the most affected as he was the closest to Paolo. He refused to go to school, dragging his grades down, according to Lisa. But all three had questions of their own. “Ang dami nilang tanong noon at hanggang ngayon na malaki na sila, ang dami pa rin nilang tanong na bakit pinatay ang tatay nila,” Lisa said. “Tanggap naman na nila at alam nila na hindi na maibabalik ang buhay ng tatay nila, pero marami pa rin silang gustong malaman sa nangyari sa tatay nila,” she added. (They had a lot of questions then, and until now that they’re older, they still ask a lot of questions about why their father was killed. I think they have accepted that his life can never be returned, but they still want to know what really happened.) Lisa also had questions of her own: How will she raise her children? Where will she get the money for everyday life? How will she continue with this grief? Slowly, Lisa dealt with her grief and trauma with the help of other widows and mothers left behind by those killed under Duterte’s drug war. A local church organized the women, establishing a support system that proved to be vital as killings continued in the Philippines. Human rights organizations also helped Lisa augment her measly income of P5,000 a month, enabling her to at least support her children. But above all, she learned how to use her grief to help others and learn more about their rights. “Hinuli na lang sana, tapos ikulong, harapin sa korte ang kaso, pero sa aming mahihirap, hindi ganoon kasi ang nangyayari. Hindi mo pa nga napapatunayan na malaki ang kasalanan, pero diretso papatayin na,” she said. “Iyon ang masakit, ang hirap maging mahirap. kasi ganoon na lang iyon, wala ka nang malalaban pa at isipin na lang palagi na ipasa-Diyos na lamang,” Lisa said. (They should’ve just arrested them, let them face cases in court, but for us who are poor, that’s not what happens. Even without guilt being established, people are immediately killed. That’s what hurts. It’s so hard to be poor because you really cannot fight back and you’re left to think you’ll just leave it all up to God.) It’s been almost six years since Paolo was mercilessly killed, when neighbors heard him beg for his life for the sake of his and Lisa’s three children. Their eldest child is now 17 years old, the youngest almost 12. Duterte, the person who ordered the slaughter of Filipinos, continues to evade any form of accountability, spending his post-presidency days in Davao City, the same place where he allegedly oversaw the infamous Davao Death Squad. Self-confessed hitmen, including retired cop Arturo Lascañas, alleged Duterte replicated the system in his hometown to a nationwide scale when he became president in 2016. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. repeatedly said he is committed to upholding human rights while Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla in October 2022 vowed “real justice in real time.” But there has been no significant development since then. Marcos should walk his talk and go beyond promises, according to Lisa. If he wants to show seriousness about human rights, his administration should make sure Duterte faces the court over the thousands of killings under his watch. “Dapat habulin at panagutin nila si Duterte, hindi iyong nagbubulag-bulagan sila kung sino ang may kasalanan kasi paano naman kami? Malilimot na lamang ba ang lahat ng nangyaring patayan?” Lisa still works the same job and has found fulfillment in her involvement with victims’ groups. She closely follows news about efforts to bring victims to justice, including the developments at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC pre-trial chamber on January 26 authorizes the resumption of the probe, saying it’s “not satisfied that the Philippines is undertaking relevant investigations that would warrant a deferral of the Court’s investigations on the basis of the complementarity principle.” The office of ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is expected to seek more evidence that could lead to a request for the issuance of summons or warrants to those involved in the drug war. These days, Lisa admits it’s so easy to lose hope given how things are going in the Philippines. She often just distracts herself with work and her children. On some nights, she allows herself to get lost in internet videos. One Saturday, Lisa came across an online video showing Duterte riding his motorcycle in Davao City, flanked by escorts and some of his closest allies. She felt extreme emotions that seemed to throw her back to the early hours of August 5, 2017, when she found out her longtime partner Paolo was killed by the police. “Ang lakas ng loob at ang kapal ng mukha niya, parang walang nangyari, ang saya ng buhay niya samantalang ako ang sakit sakit pa rin,” she said. “Oo nga naka-move on naman na kahit kakaunti, pero sumasakit pa rin ang loob ko kapag nakikita kong patuloy pa rin ang buhay ni Duterte, pero heto kami pinipilit magpursige na alam namin na pinatay ang aming mga mahal sa buhay,” Lisa added. (He has the gall and audacity to act like nothing happened. He’s enjoying life while I’m here, still suffering. We’ve moved on, even if only a little bit, but it hurts to see Duterte live his life while we struggle, knowing our loved ones were killed.) She hit the angry reaction button out of impulse, but immediately undid it out of fear. Her name was visible for all to see. There are other ways to fight and call for justice.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/kremlin-alarm-doomsday-clock-blames-united-states-nato/,[],"The Kremlin expressed alarm on Wednesday, January 25, that the “Doomsday Clock” had edged closer to midnight than ever, even though the scientists who moved the symbolic dial cited Moscow’s own “thinly veiled threats” to use nuclear weapons. The “Doomsday Clock,” created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to illustrate how close humanity has come to the end of the world, on Tuesday moved its “time” in 2023 to 90 seconds to midnight, 10 seconds closer than it has been for the past three years. Midnight on this clock marks the theoretical point of annihilation. The clock’s hands are moved closer to or further away from midnight based on scientists’ reading of existential threats at a particular time. “The situation as a whole is really alarming,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, calling for a sober appraisal of the tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. He said there was no prospect of any detente, based on “the line that was chosen by NATO under US leadership”. “This imposes on us a duty to be particularly careful, to be alert and to take appropriate measures,” he added. On Tuesday, the Bulletin’s president cited repeated warnings by President Vladimir Putin and other Russian politicians that Moscow might be prepared to use nuclear weapons as a key factor in the decision to advance the dial of the “Doomsday Clock”. “Russia’s thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict by accident, intention or miscalculation is a terrible risk,” Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, told a news conference in Washington. – Rappler.com"

Starting off the hostilities at 4 pm are the upstart Akari Chargers – now led by star blocker Dindin Santiago-Manabat – taking on the ever-popular Choco Mucho Flying Titans, now coached by men’s national volleyball team coach Dante Alinsunurin. Meanwhile at 6 pm, the Creamline Cool Smashers will begin their title defense against their longtime rivals, the newly crowned 2022 Reinforced Conference champion Petro Gazz Angels, now mentored by former Choco Mucho coach Oliver Almadro. Then as a Valentine’s Day treat to PVL fans, the league has matched up Creamline and Choco Mucho for a February 14 sister team showdown, still at the Araneta Coliseum at 6 pm. In their last meeting at the 2022 Reinforced Conference, the Cool Smashers and Flying Titans notched a PVL-pandemic record 19,117 fans at the Mall of Asia Arena despite their contest being held on a weekday at the time. Other marquee matchups in the all-Filipino conference include a 4 pm match on February 7 at the PhilSports Arena between the Mika Reyes-led PLDT High Speed Hitters and the F2 Cargo Movers, now bannered by their big off-season acquisition, two-time PVL MVP Myla Pablo. PLDT is also parading its own off-season haul: newly crowned champion coach Rald Ricafort, Pablo’s one-time mentor with Petro Gazz. Then on February 9 at 6 pm, Almadro will hand his former wards a big challenge as Petro Gazz takes on Choco Mucho at the FilOil EcoOil Centre. Still at PhilSports, F2 faces Akari next on February 11 at 6 pm in an early litmus test for two potential playoff contenders. After its Valentine’s Day date with Choco Mucho, Creamline will next turn its focus to F2 in a potential finals preview on February 18 at 6 pm, also at PhilSports. On March 2 at 4 pm, the Cignal HD Spikers take on Choco Mucho in another early battle to gauge playoff possibilities, while Petro Gazz faces F2 in another important game at 6 pm. Although all elimination round games are already up on the PVL website, the schedule is still subject to change. Also, no venues have been announced yet for games beyond March 9. Fans should expect volleyball overload from February to March as the PVL Open is expected to run concurrently with the UAAP Season 85 women’s and men’s volleyball tournaments, the NCAA Season 98 women’s volleyball tournament, and the ongoing Spikers’ Turf men’s volleyball Open Conference. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/filipinas-women-football-team-look-build-success-2022-investing-future/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – For the Philippine women’s football team to enjoy a sustained level of success, head coach Alen Stajcic believes that the program will need to undergo a massive facelift moving forward. “It has come to a point when I reflect that the pathway in this country will have to come upside down – from the seniors national team [to the juniors] – rather than the traditional grassroots, from this level to the next level, to the seniors national team,” Stajcic said during the Filipinas press conference at the Acacia Hotel in Alabang on Wednesday, January 25. Stajcic cited Asian neighbor Japan, where the women’s team transformed from virtual nobodies to world champions by 2011 in the Women’s World Cup, as a prime example. “They have put together a strategy, they stick together. They’re united, they’re aligned, they have a philosophy, they have a drive, a vision. I think we have to start putting those things in place,” he added. Stajcic, along with new under-20 head coach Nahuel Arrarte, recently conducted an open tryout in the United States, which was attended by 110 hopefuls from countries such as America, Australia, and Canada, among others. The team is also set to recruit new blood in several tryouts in Manila, Cebu, and Davao soon, he added. Following a banner year in the program where the Filipinas claimed their first World Cup stint and ruled the AFF Women’s Championship, they are setting to prove that their achievements are not a flash in the pan. Up next for the team aside from the World Cup are the Southeast Asian Games in May, and the Olympic qualifying tournament in April, where they are heavy favorites to make it to the second round. In their immediate sights is the 2023 Pinatar Cup in Murcia, Spain this March, where they will meet higher-ranked European squads Wales, Scotland, and Iceland. “We try to get that medal for the country… we’ll never stop wanting more. I can speak for the girls that we really want it,” said goalkeeper Inna Palacios. “Just like what coach Alan said, the climb is a bit harder if you keep climbing a bit higher, we want to achieve as much as we can but we’re very much grounded… we know how hard it is.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/erwin-tulfo-says-marcos-jr-easy-work-with-sometimes-micromanager/,['RYAN MACASERO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Over a month after Erwin Tulfo made a quiet exit as Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) secretary of the Ferdinand Marcos Jr. administration, he said that the President was “easy to work with” but was also hands-on on some occasions, providing a rare peek into the opaque administration and how the president works behind the scenes. “To tell you the truth… it’s easy [working with Marcos],” Tulfo said during a Rappler Talk interview on Wednesday, January 25. (READ: Rappler Talk: Erwin Tulfo after his Marcos Cabinet stint) “Honestly, when we ask for funding for disasters, like what happened during the first earthquake in Abra, we sent funds [to the province]. Then suddenly a tropical storm followed, there was flooding in that region again so our funds were depleted. I said ‘sir we need funding to replenish.’ All he told me was to talk to (Budget) Secretary Pangandaman, and that’s it,” Tulfo said in a mix of Filipino and English. During his time as DSWD secretary, Tulfo said his biggest challenge was the red tape and complicated bureaucracy. “When someone would ask for funds like burial or hospital expenses, they would want their relative out of the hospital but they need funds. They’d bring the medical bill, ID, other paperwork, and they’d have to return after 3 to 7 days, of course the bill would accumulate,” Tulfo said. “What I did was, I gave a directive, if possible, to make the fund release the same day for the medical bills,” he added. Tulfo said the streamlining of requirements was also supported by the President. “I asked permission from Malacañang, and they said to do it,” the former social welfare secretary said. The President was sometimes hands-on in the DSWD, or even “micromanaging,” Tulfo said. “There are instances where he micromanages. like distribution of relief packs. ‘I heard a certain mayor didn’t get any, there in Bicol or Mindanao,’ [Marcos] would tell me,” Tulfo said. “Most of the time he’d let us do what we needed to do,” the former broadcaster added. When he was social welfare secretary, Tulfo said they also had a “direct line” to the president, if they needed to reach him to consult on department matters. Tulfo faced intense grilling by the Commission on Appointments, who raised his being a former United States citizen and a libel conviction, as the reasons for his being bypassed. On his US citizenship, Tulfo said he had renounced it over a year ago, but that there were complications. “The situation is complicated, even until now,” Tulfo said. “It’s really hard to answer because… as far as the documents I have, it states that I’m no longer an American citizen,” he added. Tulfo said the last time he used his US passport was over a year ago, before his appointment. Despite not being able to hurdle the CA, Marcos said that he was keen on keeping Tulfo in the administration, citing his performance as DSWD secretary. (READ: Marcos wants Erwin Tulfo to stay in admin) While Marcos and Tulfo mutually agreed that the latter would step down from his Cabinet position, the President asked him to remain until an officer-in-charge would be appointed to head the department. It was announced last December 27 that another former journalist, Edu Punay, would take over as DSWD officer-in-charge. While Tulfo said he has yet to discuss with the President what the specific role would be for him, he said he was open to taking up another position with the Marcos administration. “If it’s social services again, then I’ll take the job,” Tulfo said. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/philippine-authorities-supplied-trafficked-ofw-genuine-travel-documents/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – An overseas Filipino worker (OFW) who testified being trafficked to Cambodia to work for a cryptocurrency scam operation was given genuine documents from the Philippine government that allowed him to travel to the dubious job opportunity abroad, a Senate probe on Wednesday, January 25, revealed. In a hearing of the Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality joint with the migrant workers committee, an OFW only known as “Ron” said that he was able to slip through applying for clearance documents to be an “interior designer” in Cambodia, when he understood the job he applied for was to be a call center agent. He followed the instructions of a recruiter he met online. The hearing was investigating reports of OFWs being trafficked to Southeast Asian countries. In November 2022, Senator Risa Hontiveros revealed a report of OFWs forced to work as scammers by an alleged Chinese mafia in Myanmar. On January 18, Hontiveros exposed another report of OFWs brought to Cambodia to perform the same exact crypto scam. They were forced to work long hours of befriending victims on dating and messaging apps and convincing them to invest in cryptocurrencies. They witnessed their co-workers get electrocuted by their reportedly Chinese employers. Ron said that his $800-salary was cut when he was unsuccessful in finding people to scam. Ron was able to undergo and receive an attendance certificate for a pre-departure orientation seminar required by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. He was also issued an overseas employment certificate (OEC). In the Wednesday hearing, Migrant Workers Undersecretary Bernard Olalia confirmed that Ron’s documents were “genuine and authentic.” Olalia explained that the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) had two “lines of defense” in verifying legitimate employers. The first is called “verification,” where Migrant Workers Offices (MWOs, formerly known as Philippine Overseas Labor Offices or POLOs) require employers or their representatives to physically present themselves to Philippine authorities for a series of interviews. Here, they determine the employers’ identity, line of business, industry, and the genuineness of the OFW’s would-be position. But not all host countries have MWOs. In areas where there are no MWOs, the first line of defense is called “authentication,” where Philippine embassy or consulate officials verify the documents. Olalia said that because there was no MWO in Cambodia, Ron’s employer was not called to the embassy. But Ron did present his documents to the Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh, which were accepted. “That is, tinatawag po nating gap (We call this a gap),” Olalia admitted. “Kaya nga po ang ating suggestion, dapat po sa lahat ng destination countries, ideally, dapat mayroon po tayong MWOs.” (That’s why our suggestion is, ideally, all of the destination countries of OFWs should have MWOs.) The second line of defense is called “accreditation,” where, after authentication, the Philippine post sends documents to the land-based division of DMW, where they are checked for compliance with minimum labor standards. Olalia said this was not done in Ron’s case. Hontiveros said that there should not be any gaps among government agencies, as OFWs continuously seek jobs abroad. “Ang irony pa po, Usec Olalia, ‘yung mga legit naman na kumpanya, ‘yung mga legit na OFW, ang hirap daw makakuha ng OEC. Samantala itong pekeng kumpanya na sindikato, na somehow nakalusot sa verification o authentication on our side doon sa Cambodia, eh nakapagpunta at nakapagbiktima ng isang Ron, at malamang hindi lamang siya. May iba pa,” said Hontiveros. (The irony is, Undersecretary Olalia, the legitimate companies, the legitimate OFWs – some say they have a hard time acquiring OECs. Meanwhile, this fake syndicate company which was somehow able to slip past our verification or authentication processes on our side in Cambodia, were able to victimize Ron, and not just him. There are more.) Senator Raffy Tulfo, who chairs the Senate migrant workers committee, chimed in: “Alam mo kung bakit? May pera ang sindikato eh. ‘Yung mga legit, walang perang panglagay (You know why? Syndicates have money. The legitimate ones don’t have money for that).” Olalia said the DMW holds accountability as it has the mandate to protect OFWs. He reported to the senators that as soon as consul general Emma Sarne of the Philippine embassy in Cambodia found out about this modus, she “immediately” physically visited the DMW in July 2022 to report to them. The DMW stopped all deployment to Cambodia and issued a labor advisory informing prospective OFWs that there are scam operators in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. Sarne confirmed in the hearing that there was an increase of Filipinos being illegally recruited and forced to work in online scamming activities in the kingdom. She said the embassy has facilitated the rescue of 119 Filipinos from unnamed online gambling facilities in Cambodia. According to Sarne, the illegal recruiters used to recruit Filipinos who were already in Cambodia. But when the kingdom began loosening travel restrictions during the pandemic, OFWs began coming in as tourists availing of visa-free entry for Association of Southeast Asian Nations member-states. “These recruiters are actually using legitimate Cambodian companies without the knowledge of these companies… to get valid OECs. There is also a case where my signature and the seal of the embassy was actually forged by these scammers,” said Sarne in a mix of English and Filipinos. In a Malacañang briefing on January 10, Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople said that the department plans to put up four MWOs in 2023 in Bangkok, Guam, and two more to-be-determined areas. Apart from Cambodia, there are no MWOs yet in Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, despite these countries also having reported victims of human trafficking, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). Tulfo asked the DMW and DFA for a specific timetable of when the additional MWOs would be up and running. Olalia and Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega were unable to promise the offices would be up within a week or a month. But De Vega said “more realistically,” within the quarter. De Vega said that the DMW signifies their requests to the DFA to build MWOs in host countries, and the DFA brings these requests to the host governments. Tulfo slammed how the government agencies’ approach was “reactive.” “Ito, madam chair, ang problema sa atin eh. Ano tayo, reactive tayo. Dapat proactive. Kapag meron nang problema, meron nang biktima, saka tayo umaaksyon. Dapat nafo-foresee ‘nyo na this could be a problem dahil walang MWO – ‘Oh, maglagay na tayo, makipagusap tayo sa host country, sa Cambodia, sa Vietnam, Laos,'” said Tulfo. (This, madam chair, is the problem with us. We’re reactive. We should be proactive. When there is a problem already, when there is a victim already, that’s when we take action. You should be able to foresee that this could be a problem because we don’t have an MWO – [you should think] “We should put one up, we should talk to the host country, to Cambodia, to Vietnam, and Laos.”) De Vega acknowledged the urgency of putting up MWOs in the Southeast Asian countries with incidents of trafficking. Gesturing to Olalia, De Vega asked the DMW to supply details, like the name of the prospective labor attachés, to have the new MWOs accredited. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/government-starts-assisted-sim-card-registration-remote-areas-january-25-2023/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines – Government agencies and telecommunications companies put up sites for assisted SIM card registration in select remote areas to reach people who have limited access to the internet. So far, 15 pilot sites have been identified across the country, which will be up between Wednesday, January 25, and Friday, January 27. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and the National Telecommunications Commission said they intend to add more sites to help those who don’t use smartphones or those who don’t have identification cards. The pilot sites are located in covered courts and gymnasiums. Transportation to get to the areas will not be covered by the national government and it would be up to local government units if they would want to provide such services. SIM card registration requires an ID, which millions of Filipinos do not have. For those who do not have a government ID, the Department of Justice said there will be booths for securing a National Bureau of Investigation clearance within the SIM card assistance hubs. An NBI or barangay clearance would suffice for SIM registration purposes. DICT Undersecretary Anna Mae Lamentillo said the agency is looking into the possibility of simultaneously capturing biometrics for the national ID while registering SIM cards. SIM cards that are not registered on or before the April 26 deadline will be deactivated. As of Tuesday, January 24, a total of 24.9 million SIMs have been registered, representing 14.75% of the 168 million subscribers nationwide. Smart Communications reported 12.6 million SIMs registered or 18.5% of its total subscribers. Globe Telecom has onboarded 10.29 million subscribers or 11.7% of its total users. Dito Telecommunity has been able to register over 2 million SIMs or 15.4% of its total subscribers. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/quimbo-grills-department-agriculture-official-root-onion-crisis/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – When a ranking agriculture official failed to explain the exorbitant price of onions at a House agriculture committee hearing on Wednesday, January 25, Marikina 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo offered what many consider a plausible answer: cartels. Quimbo – reacting to the presentation made by Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Plant Industry (DA-BPI) Director Glenn Panganiban – was puzzled by how onions in Philippine markets became among the world’s most expensive, when data from 2022 showed a modest shortage in supply. The demand for red onions in 2022 was 363,937 metric tons, but the supply was only around 338,354 metric tons, according to the DA. “As an economist, this is difficult to explain. I could only surmise that there is a mystery here, that there are behind-the-scenes operations that include cartels,” Quimbo said. Panganiban did not dispute Quimbo’s statement, and even confirmed an instance when a stockpile of smuggled onions that police authorities were preparing to confiscate at a warehouse in Valenzuela went missing on the day of the raid. “I cannot say if there is a cartel, but aside from the production and importation, there is someone controlling [the supply]. I’m not sure if that is how you call it,” Panganiban said. “Ang sagot diyan e kartel talaga (The answer there really is cartel). That’s it. There just has to be artificial manipulation of prices because the market cannot explain why the prices were adjusted like that,” Quimbo asserted. Quimbo also scolded Panganiban when he initially said that the BPI had yet to coordinate with the Philippine Competition Commission on the incident in Valenzuela. Panganiban later corrected his statement and said his agency had met with the PCC, which is only in the preliminary investigation phase. Quimbo earlier filed a resolution seeking a probe into the alleged anti-competitive prices of onions in the market. Based on the DA’s price monitoring data, local red onions were sold in markets for P480 to P600 per kilo, and white onions at around P450 to 600. Such prices are 607% more costly than the international average which is $1.54 per kilo or around P84.87, based on the Global Product Prices database. The DA, headed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., already approved the importation of 21,060 metric tons of onions to address the crisis, although the move is expected to hurt farmers, who would not be able to match the cheaper imports and would be forced to sell their products at a price that would yield low returns. – Rappler.com * Some quotes in Filipino were translated into English and shortened for brevity."

The former NBA player churned out a game-high 32 points on top of 9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 steals after securing a FIBA clearance to play for the Road Warriors from his Chinese Basketball Association team Shanxi Loongs. Simmons connived with Kevin Alas as they combined for 63 points in the runaway victory that saw the two outscore the entire Bossing, 29-21, in the fourth quarter for a rousing start to the conference. Blackwater trailed by just 3 points at the end of the third frame, 81-84, before Alas took over in the final salvo, uncorking 19 of his 31 points in the period as NLEX pulled away. Simmons scored 10 fourth-quarter points. “We’re lucky we have him,” Road Warriors head coach Frankie Lim said in Filipino of Simmons, who played for the San Antonio Spurs, Orlando Magic, and Philadelphia 76ers. Big man Brandon Ganuelas-Rosser shone on both ends for NLEX with 21 points, 5 rebounds, 3 blocks, 3 assists, and 2 steals, Anthony Semerad chalked up 15 points, while Matt Nieto chimed in 12 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 steals. The romp marked the Road Warriors return of Sean Anthony and the debut of new acquisitions Jake Pascual and Hesed Gabo. Former PBA D-League MVP Gabo netted 5 points in his first PBA game, while Anthony and Pascual – who were part of a three-team trade with TNT and Phoenix – combined for 5 points and 9 rebounds. Returning Bossing import Sean Glover delivered his usual numbers of 26 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 4 blocks, but he coughed up 8 turnovers as Blackwater crashed to its seventh straight loss dating back to last conference.

Police also identified an Army colonel, five other soldiers, and a civilian as alleged accomplices. Authorities also revealed that the gun used in killing Plaza was a military-issued firearm. “It was a crime of passion,” said Brigadier General Benjamin Silo Jr., the director of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the Davao Region during a news conference on Wednesday, January 25. PNP-Davao Region and Special Task Group Plaza spokesperson Major Eudisan Gultiano identified the following suspects: (Editor’s note: We updated this list to correct misspelled surnames, and ranks based on the actual complaint filed by the PNP.) There were two John Does – one referred to only as Master Sergeant and another called Junior. Silo said the investigation showed that Plaza had sensitive information against Durante, and had planned to use it to blackmail the Army general. He said Durante and Plaza had an affair based on the pieces of evidence investigators gathered, and witnesses spoke of jealousy, “but we are looking into other factors that might have led to this senseless killing.” Silo said there was “clarity of circumstances,” and an extra-judicial confession. “These interlocked… We have a very strong case against the mastermind,” he said. Three of the suspects – Corporal Cashero, Sergeant Sialsa, and civilian Hapitan – executed extra-judicial confessions, according to Gultiano. The attack on Plaza, which was caught on CCTV camera, was carried out by two motorcycle-riding and helmet-wearing gunmen near her rented home at Green Meadows subdivision in Mintal in Davao City’s Tugbok District, just two nights before New Year’s Eve. Durante, who served as the head of the group that secured former president Rodrigo Duterte, has been relieved from his post as commander of the Army’s 1001st Infantry Brigade based in Davao de Oro province. Brigadier General Allan Hambala, assistant commander of the 10th Infantry Division, said the soldiers linked to the grisly murder had been relieved of their posts and were in the custody of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command. Hambala assured the police that the Army will fully cooperate. “Whatever crime they may have committed, they will have to face it,” Hambala said. Durante earlier caught the attention of police investigators after he responded to allegations about his involvement that went the rounds of social media. He came forward to strongly deny that he had anything to do with the Plaza murder. But he revealed that he and Plaza were “close friends,” and that he was saddened to learn about her brutal killing.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/only-in-hollywood-triangle-of-sadness-dolly-de-leon-oscars-snub/,['RUBEN V. NEPALES'],"LOS ANGELES, USA – A lot of sadness over Dolly de Leon’s Oscars snub for her powerful performance in Triangle of Sadness. The film bagged three Academy nominations – best picture, director, and original screenplay (the latter two for Ruben Ostlund) – but Dolly, whose portrayal of Abigail elevated the film, did not get a nod. Many people, especially Filipinos around the world, hoped to hear or read that Dolly scored what would have been the first acting nomination by a Pinoy actor in the Oscars’ 95-year history. But in the Academy’s nominations announcement early Tuesday morning (Tuesday evening, Manila time) at the Academy’s Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, there was disappointingly no Oscar love for Dolly. Let me put it this way – minus Dolly’s portrayal of the toilet yacht worker who becomes a chief player midway – would Triangle of Sadness have been as effective? Would Ruben Ostlund’s satire of the super-rich have been as memorable? Had Dolly been nominated, there would have been three Asians in the best supporting actress category – she, Hong Chau (The Whale) and Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). But Hong and Stephanie’s citations still mark the first time that two Asian women are recognized in this category in the same year. In the early morning ceremonies hosted by Oscar winner Riz Ahmed and M3GAN actress Allison Williams – Hong, Stephanie, Angela Bassett (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), Kerry Condon (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Everything Everywhere All at Once) were announced as the best supporting actress contenders. The nominations announcement was otherwise a banner year for Asian actors. It was the largest batch of Asian nominees ever – Hong, Stephanie, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan (the latter two for Everything Everywhere…). And these four actors are all first-time Academy nominees. Michelle Yeoh became the first Oscar best actress nominee to openly identify herself as Asian. Merle Oberon, whose father was British and mother was from Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) and had Maori roots as well, garnered a best actress nod for The Dark Angel in 1936. But the Bombay-born Merle passed herself as white, a sad reflection of the racist colonial society of that era. She made up a story that she was of French, Irish and Dutch descent and that she was born in Tasmania. If Michelle wins on March 12, she would be the first Asian and the first Malaysian to triumph as best actress in the Academy‘s almost century of existence. She would be the second woman of color to cinch that honor after Halle Berry who made history in 2002 for Monster’s Ball. Ana de Armas, who was cited for Blonde, is the first Cuban to be nominated in this circle. The other best actress nominees are Cate Blanchett (Tar) and Andrea Riseborough (To Leslie), whose inclusion surprised some and was credited to last-minute heavy push on social media by her famous fellow actors, including Jane Fonda, Gwyneth Paltrow, Amy Adams, Geena Davis, and Kate Winslet. Left out were two women who were buzzed as very likely nominees: Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till). Before Tuesday morning, many thought Viola’s nomination was a lock. Back to Stephanie, she is the second openly queer actor in the Oscars’ history, since Ian McKellen in Gods and Monsters (1999), to earn an acting nod for portraying a queer character. In the supporting actor race, Ke Huy Quan, also from Everything, Everywhere…, became the first Vietnam-born nominee. Ke was frustrated that he could not bounce back for 40 years since his big break as a child actor as Short Round in Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. After last Tuesday morning, Ke became only the second ethnically Chinese performer to be in the running for best supporting actor since the late Haing S. Ngor who went on to win for The Killing Fields in 1985. Haing remains the first and only Asian best supporting actor winner. Except for Judd Hirsch, all supporting actor contenders this year are first-timers: Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin), Brian Tyree Henry (Causeway), Barry Keoghan (The Banshees…) and Ke. Judd holds the record for having the longest gap between supporting actor nods – 42 years – between Ordinary People (1981) and now, for The Fabelmans. For his 10-minute onscreen minutes as a grand uncle in Steven Spielberg’s film based on his youth, Judd also became the second oldest acting nominee (Christopher Plummer is the oldest – he was 88 when he was cited for All the Money in the World in 2018). It’s a remarkable year for Oscar nominee neophytes. For 16 of the 20 acting contenders, it was their first time to hear or read their names as Academy nominees. In the best actor derby, it’s the first time since 1934 that all nominees are rookie contenders: Austin Butler (Elvis), Colin Farrell (The Banshees…), Brendan Fraser (The Whale) and Paul Mescal (Aftersun). Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, co-directed by Filipino Januel Mercado, got in the best animated feature film race. But under the Academy rules, director Joel Crawford and producer Mark Swift were listed as the nominees. The Last Wish is up against Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, The Sea Beast and Turning Red (the first Pixar feature directed by an Asian woman, Domee Shi, and it’s her feature directing debut). Domee is the sole Asian director of the nominated films in this category. Daniel Kwan, a Massachusetts native of Chinese heritage, is the only non-Caucasian among the best director finalists: Daniel Scheinert, Kwan’s fellow director (Everything Everywhere…); Martin McDonagh (The Banshees…). Steven Spielberg (The Fabelmans), Todd Field (Tar), and Ruben Ostlund (Triangle of Sadness). Potential female filmmaker nominees, especially Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Woman King), Sarah Polley (Women Talking) and Charlotte Wells (Aftersun), were left out. Kwan and Scheinert, known collectively as the Daniels, have two other nominations – best picture (as producers, with Jonathan Wang) and original screenplay. Asian films were shut out of the international feature field. South Korea’s Decision to Leave, directed by Park Chan-wook, was considered a shoo-in among the 15 on the shortlist but it did not make it to the top five. Cambodia’s Return to Seoul, Pakistan’s Joyland, and India’s Last Film Show also failed to make the cut. Instead, these are the five nominees: All Quiet on the Western Front (Germany), Argentina, 1985 (Argentina), Close (Belgium), EO (Poland), and The Quiet Girl (Ireland). Only Argentina, 1985 managed to crash this circle of European films. All Quiet on the Western Front also made it to the 10 best picture candidates: Avatar: The Way of Water, The Banshees…, Elvis, Everything, Everywhere…, The Fabelmans, Tar, Top Gun: Maverick, Triangle of Sadness, and Women Talking. With his original score citation for The Fabelmans, John Williams not only boosted his record for having the most nominations (53). At 90, he is now also the oldest person to be in the running for a competitive Oscar. By mid-Tuesday, “No Dolly de Leon” was trending on Twitter as hundreds of folks who loved the actress’ performance in Triangle of Sadness tweeted their sentiments. Earlier, on Monday, expectations for the Pinay went on overdrive as Dolly, the only Asian in the best supporting actress derby of the Guldbagge (Golden Beetles), Sweden’s most prestigious film honors, won. Rafe Bartholomew, the book author and former Fulbright scholar who fell in love with the Philippines, had the best reply to my tweet on “No Dolly de Leon” trending because of the online sentiment about the actress’ Academy snub. Paraphrasing the memorable line of Dolly’s Abigail in the film, Rafe tweeted back: “No fish for the Academy.” – Rappler.com The 95th Oscar awards will be handed out on March 12 in Hollywood."

The FiberXers tapped the services of Jamaal Franklin after relegating New Zealand import Ethan Rusbatch to the injured/reserve list on Wednesday, January 25. Picked 41st overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, Franklin suited up for the Memphis Grizzlies and the Denver Nuggets. He played a total of 24 games in the NBA before taking his act to the Chinese Basketball Association, last seeing action for the Shanghai Sharks. Franklin is expected to debut against Terrafirma on Thursday at the PhilSports Arena. The import switch came after Converge recorded its most lopsided win in franchise history with a 122-92 rout of NorthPort last Sunday. Rusbatch finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists in the blowout. FiberXers head coach Aldin Ayo said after the game that Rusbatch fits what Converge looks for in an import – a complementary piece who will allow the local players to shine. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-results-linette-pliskova-sabalenka-vekic-january-25-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – A disbelieving Magda Linette continued her dream run at the Australian Open on Wednesday, January 25, with a stunning victory over former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova to move into the semifinals, where she will play fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka. Sabalenka, the only top 10 seed left in the draw, earned her place in the last four by outmuscling Donna Vekic, 6-3, 6-2, in a ferocious battle of big hitters in the second match on a baking Rod Laver Arena. The Belarusian might have her hands full against unheralded Linette, who played wonderfully controlled tennis that belied her ranking of 45th in the world to wrap up a thoroughly deserved victory over Pliskova 6-3, 7-5. Linette had been expected to play second fiddle to fellow Pole Iga Swiatek at Melbourne Park but will now play a first Grand Slam semifinal on Thursday in a match that will decide who meets Victoria Azarenka or Elena Rybakina in the final. “It’s so much and I can’t really believe it,” the 30-year-old said. “I will never forget this. I’m breaking through some really difficult things for me. This will stay with me for life. So I’m really grateful.” Sabalenka later took her chances in a physical one-hour first set littered with break points before running away with the second to reach her fourth Grand Slam semifinal, a first in Melbourne. Vekic had held a 5-1 career record against the Belarusian but was unable to match the level of the new, improved Sabalenka with 13 double faults not helping the Croatian’s cause. Sabalenka is not so improved that she did not make plenty of errors as well but her once-fragile serve was largely solid, and when she got her explosive forehand going it was always going to be hard for Vekic to cope. Two double faults as Sabalenka served for the match were a reminder of the player she once was but, the 24-year-old saved three break points and sealed the win with a huge forehand that struck the running Vekic in the body. “She’s a great player and it’s always tough to against play her,” Sabalenka said, before explaining why she thought she had come out on top. “I think it was because I was calm and I expected this game from her, so I was able to stay in the game no matter what. That was the key.” Linette had no problems serving out her quarterfinal against twice Grand Slam finalist Pliskova, who made 36 unforced errors and was always chasing the match. The Czech knew she had to raise her game in the second set after losing the first but Linette had the answer to everything thrown at her. “She really played well from the baseline,” said Pliskova. “I just didn’t find any space in the court to go for my winners. Obviously the serve was not great today at all.” Linette had never been past the third round at a Grand Slam before arriving at Melbourne Park this year and said a change in mentality was behind her fairytale run. “I think through all my life I’ve been taking mistakes, losses very personally,” she explained. “So to disconnect (life) as a tennis player and a person was really difficult because I felt a lot of times that the mistakes were defining me.” Later on Wednesday, Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul meet in the first all-American men’s Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2007, and overwhelming favorite Novak Djokovic faces Andrey Rublev in a bid to reach a 10th Melbourne Park semifinal. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/is-time-ripe-economic-charter-change-problems-philippines/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – As Filipinos reel from rising prices of some basic goods and services, lawmakers turn to charter change discussions in a supposed bid to accelerate the country’s economic growth. The House of Representatives in the 19th Congress started tackling proposals to amend or replace the 1987 Constitution in December 2022, and is set to resume meetings beginning Thursday, January 26. The lower chamber’s miniscule minority has vehemently expressed apprehensions over the move. Two analysts whom Rappler spoke to in separate interviews are not necessarily opposed to the idea of bending the cap on foreign ownership in certain sectors, but are cautious either about the timing of the push or prioritizing charter change conversations. “We are in a situation where Filipinos cannot run our economy alone. We can’t insist on limiting foreign investment. It doesn’t make sense anymore,” said Michael Yusingco, a senior research fellow at the Ateneo School of Government. “But I don’t agree with [the concept of] prioritizing because our problems are complex, multi-layered.” “To me, it’s off that we have thought of charter change amid the many problems our economy has,” added Agustin Arcenas, associate professor from the University of the Philippines Los Baños’ College of Public Affairs and Development. They also emphasized that charter change is not the only answer to the country’s current economic headaches. “We should erase the narrative that changing the Constitution will immediately make our lives easier. It’s not automatic, it doesn’t work that way,” Yusingco said. “I think it should be the last thing in their minds because our economic problems are immediate and they require attention,” Arcenas added. Out of nine bills referred to the House constitutional amendments panel, two are pushing for economic amendments, namely, measures filed by House energy panel chairman Lord Allan Velasco (Marinduque), and legislative franchises committee chairman Gus Tambunting (Parañaque 2nd District). Tambunting wrote that the goal is to “accelerate economic growth and fulfill the Philippines’ international commitment.” The two propose to amend provisions in Articles XII, XIV, and XVI of the existing charter, saying that restrictions hamper the country from receiving more foreign investments, unlike Southeast Asian neighbors with more liberal ownership rules. The 2022 World Competitiveness Ranking of the International Institute for Management Development, for instance, ranks the Philippines 48th out of 63 countries, partly citing the country’s restrictive investment environment as a factor in its low ranking. Foreign citizens, for example, are constitutionally prohibited from taking more than a 40% share of capital in co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreement in matters involving natural resources. In a proposed amendment, the phrase “unless provided by law” will be added to give lawmakers the option to pass a measure that would provide a wider leeway for foreign investors to operate. Tambunting argued that removing restrictive economic provisions will allow foreign businesses to “breeze into a more conducive investment landscape.” Alongside exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources, foreign investors will be allowed broader control in public utilities, lands of the public domain, grants of congressional franchises, educational institutions, advertising, and mass media. For Yusingco, easing economic restrictions is necessary to “open up the market.” “It doesn’t make sense that our Constitution restricts these industries, but at the same time, our state, our government cannot actually effectively run these sectors,” Yusingco said. When the framers of the 1987 Constitution created the charter, they aspired for a more nationalized setup for the country’s industries through the 60-40 rule. Yusingco said the expectation at that time was that wealthy Filipinos would invest their money in the Philippine economy. He believes that if foreign investors are permitted to have a bigger slice of the pie, competition across industries will increase. For Arcenas, there are some industries where putting Filipinos in the driver’s seat is “non-negotiable.” “I don’t think that foreign dominance should be encouraged or allowed, particularly in the media,” he said. “On the issue of natural resources, it depends because if it’s a natural resource that will protect our food security, I think it must remain in the hands of Filipinos.” “But for other sectors like telecommunications, why not, so that we could improve our internet and phone services,” he added. Arcenas also warned that foreign competition might pose a threat to local businesses. “It’s not a win-win situation with all its negative impacts. There’s a winner and there’s a loser. The question is: what do you do with the loser, how do you help the loser?” he asked. Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel of the left-wing, three-member Makabayan bloc is adamant against easing economic restrictions due to fears that it would favor only foreigners and individuals with political and economic powers. “This will not serve the interest of the Filipino people, who are now struggling with high prices of basic goods, inaccessible social services, and other problems,” Manuel told Rappler in a separate interview. He said that instead of relying on the possible outcomes of amending the Constitution, the attention should shift to genuine agrarian reform and national industrialization. “We need to have factories for basic commodities, where they can provide jobs for our citizens. With that, we no longer need to expose our economy to big foreign corporations that will only deplete much-need resources that Filipinos should benefit from,” Manuel asserted. Manuel added that a 100% foreign ownership will erode the capacity of the country to stand on its own feet on matters such as food and energy sources. But Yusingco hopes that should the economic charter change gain traction, safety nets would be in place. “We open the economy in our Constitution, but still we retain the discretion of who we allow to come in, right? So, we can’t just open and let anyone in, it doesn’t work that way,” he said. Attempts to amend the Constitution have been made since the Fidel V. Ramos administration, but none have succeeded amid fears that any push would eventually result in politicians’ longer stay in office. “When the word charter change is said, the immediate thought of people is that [politicians] just want to extend their terms,” Yusingco said. The administrations of Joseph Estrada and Benigno Aquino III saw proposals to introduce economic amendments in the charter, specifically on opening up more sectors to foreign investors. The Marcos administration is in a familiar but also unfamiliar situation: charter change discussions are not new, but the economic circumstances of today are arguably more challenging than before. Regardless of constitutional amendments, Yusingo believes that the solution to the current economic crisis lies in Marcos’ quality of governance. “If the current administration does not improve, in terms of their governance, then what confidence will our economy improve? No, we have no confidence. It will only get worse,” he said. For Manuel, Filipinos should remain vigilant, as he offers the reminder that the 1987 Constitution was crafted in the aftermath of the people’s resistance to the dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos. “If those [economic provisions] are removed, the people will not be the winners. The wealth and power in the country will only be concentrated to a select few,” he said. – Dexter Barro II/Rappler.com * All quotes in Filipino were translated into English, and some were shortened for brevity."
https://www.rappler.com/nation/military-plane-crash-pilar-bataan-january-25-2023/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – An SF-260TP plane belonging to the Philippine Air Force (PAF) crashed in Pilar, Bataan, on Wednesday morning, January 25, the military said. PAF spokesperson Colonel Maria Consuelo Castillo said two pilots flying the plane for “recurrency training” died in the mishap. A local police report earlier identified the two pilots as Captain Ian Gerru Paulo and John Paulo Aviso. According to the military, the SF-260 aircraft took off from Major Danilo Atienza Air Base in Sangley Point, Cavite, at around 10 am for a training flight when at 10:40 am, witnesses reported seeing the plane “descending to a field in Sitio Tabon, Barangay Del Rosario” where it eventually crashed. “Two PAF Pilots perished in the mishap while no civilian casualties were reported,” Castillo said. Personnel from the PAF’s aircraft accident investigation team were onsite to investigate the incident. Castillo also said that all active SF-260TP aircraft will be grounded as a standard procedure pending the investigation. The Bataan crash is the third involving a Marchetti aircraft. In 2002, three Air Force pilots and a civilian were killed when an SF-260 plane crashed into the roof of a factory in Batangas. A similar incident took place in 2015, when two pilots were killed after an SF-260FH went down during a training mission near Nasugbu, Batangas. The PAF earlier said the military lost track of the aircraft at 10:34 am or roughly 30 minutes into the flight. An initial report from local police in Pilar town said the cops received a call at around 10:40 am from residents in Sitio Tabon, Barangay Del Rosario, who witnessed “a plane fast descending downward to a field.” During an inspection of the area, Pilar police found an Air Force plane marked with the number 29 “crashed in the middle of the field with two pilots, both servicemen of the Philippine Air Force still inside the cockpit.” The PAF identified the SF-260TP as an attack aircraft asset in the PAF’s15th Strike Wing. The plane is also capable of conducting “close air support, battlefield air interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, persuasion flight, armed escort, maritime patrol, air cover, flare drop, forward air controller, and aerial demonstration.” “The SF260-TP is a highly maneuverable and fully aerobatic basic trainer aircraft of the PAF that serves as a light attack combat aircraft. It was used during the Marawi siege and various combat missions of the PAF,” Castillo said. The crash in Bataan is the latest in a series of military aircraft accidents that have taken place in recent years. Since 2011, there have been at least 16 accidents involving military aircraft, based on published reports. – Rappler.com"

Wala ring balita hinggil dito mula sa mga kilalang news outlet gaya ng GMA, ABS, TV5, CNN, Inquirer, Manila Bulletin, Philstar, at Rappler. Ang dahilang tinukoy ni Carlos sa kanyang pagbaba sa puwesto ay hindi na niya nakikitang dapat pa siyang magpatuloy bilang tagapayo ng Pangulo, kung kaya’t lumipat na lamang siya sa ibang ahensiya kung saan magagamit ang kanyang kaalaman sa paggawa ng polisiya. Sa kanyang mga naging panayam sa Teleradyo noong Enero 16, sinabi niyang masaya siyang lilipat sa Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) dahil akma ang trabaho rito sa kanyang kakayanan sa paggawa ng polisiya. “Happy ako na lilipat ako sa trabaho na talagang akma sa expertise ko,” pahayag ni Carlos matapos sabihing lilipat siya sa CPBRD. Ito’y dahil wala sa kanya, aniya, ang ni isa sa tatlong kuwalipikasyong kailangan upang maging NSA. Sa kanyang mga naging panayam sa TeleRadyo, CNN, at sa Tune In kay Tunying kanya ring nabanggit na mayroong “forces” na gusto siyang mapaalis simula pa noong umpisa ng kanyang termino. Itinanggi naman ito ni Marcos noong Enero 20 at sinabing naniniwala siyang walang planong paalisin si Carlos mula sa kanyang puwesto. Sinabi ng Pangulo na sa tingin niya’y hindi nagustuhan ni Carlos ang pagiging NSA, na hindi raw nakagugulat dahil think tank ang pinanggalingan niya. – Ailla Dela Cruz/ Rappler.com Kung may nakikita kang kahina-hinalang Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, artikulo, o mga larawan sa iyong network, i-send ang mga ito sa factcheck@rappler.com.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/opinion-fighting-dignity-work-labor-philippines/,[],"In Laudato si’, Pope Francis talks about how the labor of humans holds the world together. Humans actualize their relationship with nature and God through labor. It is a necessary part of existence for survival, human development, and personal fulfillment. The goal is to give life dignity through work. However, conditions of labor under late-stage capitalism have become very dehumanizing and exploitative. Instead of humans being the source, focus, and aim of economic and social activity, they have become the slaves of capital. This is further exacerbated by its resultant economic issues such as inflation. According to the recent wage report by ILO, real wage percentages dropped to minus 0.9%; the first time in this century where real global wage experienced negative growth. In the Philippines, the implementation of neoliberal policies that began during the regime of Marcos Sr. and continues up to the current regime of his son, resulted in the stagnation of real wage. Real wage in the National Capital Region is at P488 or $8.96 (September 2022), and continues to decline amid worsening inflation. Around 20 million Filipinos live under P401 per day, which is the government’s poverty threshold. Workers also suffer under precarious working conditions. Contractualization stripped workers of job security and benefits. According to the Ecumenical Institute for Labor Education and Research or EILER, three out of five workers are contractual in the Philippines. Other forms of labor flexibilization are also being introduced with the rise of Industry 4.0. Digitization of work coupled with massive unemployment resulted in the rise of the “gig economy.” The most prominent examples are platform workers such as Food Panda and Grab drivers who are not recognized as employees by their respective companies. This makes them vulnerable to unfair compensation and treatment. The BPO industry employs around 1.3 million workers who are experiencing a decline in wages, lack of job security, and benefits. Workers, especially those in industry and construction, work in very unsafe conditions. Companies are risking workplace safety for cost-cutting and profit maximization. Workplace accidents and other occupational safety concerns remain commonplace because of the lack of oversight, especially from the government. Gender inequality and abuse also continue to occur in workplaces. The wage-gap between men and women persists, and members of the LGBTQ+ continue to be discriminated against. Technology and capital, in the hands of the few, stripped labor of its emancipatory character, and relegated workers to becoming mere appendages of machines. The concept of dignity of work has been mentioned in numerous papal encyclicals. Pope Leo XIII’s Rerum Novarum in 1891 discussed the relationship between labor and capital. It propounds the idea that the state should ensure the welfare of workers regarding wages, working hours, and working conditions. In Laborem Exercens, Pope John Paul expounded on the dignity of work to include living wage for workers. According to Pope John Paul: “Just remuneration for the work of an adult who is responsible for a family means remuneration which will suffice for establishing and properly maintaining a family and for providing security for its future.” He also tasked the church to speak out on the conditions of workers as part of its spiritual mission. Dignity of work can also be traced back to Marx’s analysis of labor. According to Marx, labor is the most fundamental activity in which humans interact with nature, not only as a means to survive, but as a means to transform nature itself.  Dignity is not something external to labor, but intrinsic. However, the reality that workers do not own the means of production leads to what Marx calls estranged or alienated labor. Because they do not own the means of production, workers become slaves of production. Workers have no control over what is produced, how it is produced, and who gets the products of labor. They simply sell their labor power in return for wages. The estranged or alienated character of labor creates the condition for undignified work. Therefore, reclaiming the dignity of work entails the abolition of the conditions for the alienation of labor. Freedom of association is indispensable in upholding the dignity of work. Historically, it is through collective action of unions and working-class parties that workers are able to assert their economic and political rights. Significant achievements have been made throughout their centuries of struggle: from the Chartists movement who fought for reforms, the Paris Commune who pursued the first working class revolution, to the socialist revolutions during the 20th century led by proletarian parties. The fight for the 8-hour workday was won by working classes from all over the world. Wage increases are fought tooth and nail in picket lines and strikes. In June 1948, the International Labor Organization Convention No. 87 recognized the freedom of association and organization, which includes the formation of unions, and which was echoed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope John Paul also recognizes the power of unions as a “mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice.” However, unionism and other forms of workers’ organizations are being attacked relentlessly by capitalists and the government especially in developing countries such as the Philippines. Neoliberal policies such as contractualization, as well as repressive policies, have reduced union membership to 0.42% of the labor force. Labor organizations and advocates are being red-tagged, harassed, jailed, and killed. From 2015-2021, there have been 56 cases of extrajudicial killings among workers in the Philippines. Under the regime of Marcos Jr., these violations continue to happen. Much is needed to be done in fighting for the dignity of work. We have to carry and amplify the call for basic labor rights such as living wages for workers, occupational safety, respect for human rights, and the freedom to organize. The ILO is conducting its High-Level Tripartite Mission in the Philippines from January 24-27 to investigate the numerous labor rights violations. It is an opportune moment to assert the freedom of association of workers and to hold accountable those who have subjected workers to undignified work. The right to unionize was not given benevolently to the workers. It was won through their militance and determination. Only through unions can the dignity of work be reclaimed. – Rappler.com Orly Putong is a researcher for the Ecumenical Institute for Labor Education and Research (EILER).

Six years ago, the province was declared free of the disease, but now, public health workers are fighting to prevent an outbreak from taking hold in the Soccsksargen region, as the specter of this debilitating and disfiguring disease looms once again. The province had been declared filariasis-free by the Department of Health (DOH) in November 2017, after a near-zero prevalence of the disease was recorded over a five-year period. Jose Baroquillo, coordinator for mosquito-borne diseases of South Cotabato’s Integrated Provincial Health Office, confirmed that one out of 38 people tested in Sitio El Nalam, Barangay Assumption, Koronadal City, was found positive for filariasis on January 21. The infected person has been isolated and the infection is still at an early stage, which means it is still curable. To prevent the spread of the disease, health workers have launched a mass blood-testing program and will spray-fog houses in the affected area. Councilor Ester Catorce, who initiated the health outreach program, said the team will also inform residents about the disease and how to prevent its spread. In 2021, 33 cases of filariasis were detected in the villages of Maan and Mongocayo in T’boli town, but were immediately treated. Baroquillo, however, said the detected cases since 2021 did not affect the province’s filariasis-free status, and its prevalence rate has remained below 1% of the population. He also said those who tested positive for the disease, including the recent case, did not show symptoms. Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by parasitic worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or B. timori, which are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. The worms develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling. The disease can lead to permanent disability or disfigurement, and is treated with preventive chemotherapy. While one case of filariasis may not necessarily indicate a widespread outbreak, health workers normally investigate and determine if there are other cases, or if the individual may have acquired the infection in a community or area where transmission is ongoing. Such measures help determine if public health interventions such as vector control, treatment, and education are needed to prevent further transmission. – Rappler.com"

The Clippers won despite Lakers star LeBron James putting up 46 points, 2 off his season high, as well as 8 rebounds and 7 assists. James became the first player in history to have a 40-point game against every NBA franchise. Norman Powell scored 22 points as the Clippers earned their 10th consecutive victory over the Lakers going back to the opening game of the 2020-2021 season.

https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/peru-president-call-political-truce-amid-protests/,[],"LIMA, Peru – Peru’s President Dina Boluarte called for a “political truce” on Tuesday, January 24, as hundreds of protesters again took to the streets of the capital, Lima, and clashes erupted between some people in the crowds and the police, witnesses said. Television footage showed some people and police officers were injured although not seriously. And after several hours of unrest in the city center, calm was eventually restored. The protests began in December when the then president, Pedro Castillo, was ousted. More than 50 people have been killed as a result of the unrest. Economy Minister Alex Contreras said that while weeks of protests have affected some sectors, particularly tourism, the economy could grow “close to” 4% this year, boosted by a $1.55 billion recovery plan, while the sol remains the most stable currency in the region. Nonetheless, protests have caused 2 billion soles ($516.65 million) in damages to production and 3 billion soles in damage to infrastructure, President Dina Boluarte said on Tuesday in a separate briefing. Boluarte blamed former president Castillo, who is serving an 18-month term of pretrial detention while he is investigated for “rebellion,” for promoting political polarization during his nearly 17 months in power. She also said that the protests had at times turned violent because of “radical people” linked to drug trafficking, illegal mining, and smuggling. Attempts to manage the economic impact of the unrest include a $1.55 billion plan, announced late last year, and targeted at the regions most affected by the protests. The plan includes the expansion of welfare provisions such as pensions, soup kitchens and access to natural gas in homes as well as public works, and investment in mining and agriculture. Contreras said that Peru was looking to promote lithium development and would be creating a lithium working group. Peru is the world’s second-biggest copper producer but has limited lithium production. – Rappler.com ($1 = 3.8711 soles)"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/tagged-drug-trade-ex-pdea-metro-manila-chief-erwin-ogario-surrenders/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Dismissed Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Metro Manila chief Erwin Ogario surrendered to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Eastren Visayas office in Palo, Leyte, on Wednesday, January 25 – three years after a court issued a warrant for his arrest over drug-related charges. Then-president Rodrigo Duterte had named Ogario as among the government officials allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. A warrant for his arrest was issued on January 3, 2019, for alleged violation of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs of 2002. The PNP Eastern Visayas did not allow Ogario to speak to media after reading him his rights. Ogario had personally informed Rappler of his plans to surrender to Eastern Visayas police. The former PDEA official told Rappler he surrendered because he wanted to face the criminal complaint against him, and for his safety as well. He also disclosed other details related to his surrender, but Rappler withheld those information for Ogario’s safety. “Ang finile pa sa akin, non-bailable offense kaya susuko ako doon sa PNP (Philippine National Police). Doon ako sa Region 8 (Eastern Visayas), kasi taga-Region 8 ako (A non-bailable offense was filed against me that’s why I am surrendering to the PNP. I will surrender in Region 8 because I am from that region),” Ogario told Rappler. Ogario surrendered minutes after Lieutenant General Michael John Dubai, chief of the PNP Directorial Staff, attended the tribute to the SAF-44 cops in Camp Ruperto K. Kangleon in Palo, Leyte. Ogario told Rappler that he didn’t know he had a warrant of arrest, but he expected it somehow. He also added that his case was bailable, contrary to his earlier expectation. In a copy of the bail order for Ogario retrieved by Rappler, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 227 set the bail to P200,000. In 2017, Ogario was slapped with drug importation complaints. He was dismissed the same year, for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. In the drug case against Ogario, PDEA alleged that he “protected and coddled” alleged drug offender Eddon Dimagio Dalisay, who was nabbed by authorities after he claimed a parcel that contained illegal drugs in 2015, but later released by PDEA NCR, under Ogario. Prior to his dismissal, Ogario served as regional director for PDEA Caraga and Metro Manila, and also headed PDEA’s Administrative Holding Office-Administrative and Human Resource Service. In an interview with Rappler, Ogario claimed that he became subjected to “intimidation” when Isidro Lapeña was appointed as PDEA chief in July 2016. Ogario said he was reassigned when Lapeña took over. “While there are underlying causes to what I have experienced, it started with Agency Orders No. 2016-290 dated 28 July 2016. The reassignment was done whimsically and indiscriminately to harass and oppress. It was demeaning, unreasonable and humiliating,” Ogario said. Six months later, Ogario said he asked for a designation through a memorandum dated February 6, 2017. Four days later, he filed another memorandum inquiring again about his assignment. But in return, Ogario said he received show cause orders (SCO). “Ang naririnig ko doon, iniisip nila na magpa-file ako ng complaint for abuse of discretion doon sa director general that time na si Lapeña kaya naghanap sila ng kung ano’ng ititira sa akin (From what I’ve heard, they thought I will file a complaint for abuse of discretion against the director general then, Lapeña, that’s why they looked for possible complaints against me),” Ogario told Rappler. Ogario said he initially received two SCOs dated March 3 and 29, 2017. Then, in the course of his term, he received at least five SCOs. – With reports from Jazmin Bonifacio/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/cagayan-de-oro-mayor-uy-wants-new-city-hall-built-elsewhere-traffic-mess/,[],"CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Cagayan de Oro City Mayor Rolando Uy announced an ambitious plan to build a new government center in the city, citing the growing traffic congestion as the main reason for the move. The announcement has sparked discussions among local officials and residents, with some praising it as a necessary solution to the city’s traffic problem, while others have welcomed it with reservations. But one councilor has pointed out that the city government should first focus on addressing other pressing issues, such as improving infrastructure and providing better services to residents. Concerns have also been raised about the cost of the project, and the potential loss of the historical site. The mayor’s plan would cost at least P3 billion, Cagayan de Oro Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Oro Chamber) president Ray Talimio estimated. The city hall’s present Executive Building, which was the seat of government of the then-municipio Cagayan de Misamis, stands on the exact same site where local officials received dignitaries on separate occasions in the 1900s, among them then-American chief civil administrators in the Philippines William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. Cagayan de Oro councilors have called on Uy’s administration to present a detailed plan. Councilor George Goking, the chairman of the city council’s ways and means committee, supports the idea of relocating the city hall but wants public consultations first. The new seat of government could be built on an 18-hectare property in Carmen, the city’s most populous barangay, Goking said. The property, which used to be Cagayan de Oro’s sanitary landfill, was developed into an eco-park by the local government during the administration of Uy’s predecessor, Oscar Moreno. Councilor Edgar Cabanlas, who proposed the relocation before the city council, said the idea is to bring together local and national government offices in the city into one compound. The proposal, he said, would also help to ease the traffic congestion in downtown Cagayan de Oro, and partially address the issue of inadequate parking spaces. “I take the taxi whenever I go to city hall because the parking spaces there are always taken,” Cabanlas told local broadcaster Magnum Radyo on Tuesday, January 24. Cagayan de Oro, like many highly urbanized cities in the country, faces serious traffic issues stemming from rapid population growth, limited infrastructure, and urbanization. The proposal was met with a positive response from Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri, who committed to work for an initial fund of P500 million from the national government on the condition that the local government provides a suitable relocation area, according to Uy. Councilor James Judith, however, expressed apprehensions, saying that there were more pressing concerns to be addressed first before undertaking a multibillion-peso project, such as improving basic services and the local government-run hospital. “Why not prioritize spending money toward improving the city hospital? What good is a big-ticket project if we haven’t addressed basic services such as public health first?” he said. Judith also pointed out that such an undertaking would take a long time to complete. “If the city can raise funds, why not spend it on the city hospital instead? We are a billionaire city, yet our hospital is not even secondary level yet. We can’t always be referring patients to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center,” he said. Councilor John Michael Seno said the present city hall should be preserved given its historical value and that selling it should be out of the question. Another councilor, Jay Roa Pascual, proposed that the local government develop a compound and lease spaces to national government offices and even commercial establishments to generate more revenues. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/sports/stefanos-tsitsipas-sends-cheeky-invite-actress-margot-robbie-after-reaching-2023-australian-open-semis/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Stefanos Tsitsipas produced a blockbuster performance to reach the Australian Open semifinal on Tuesday, January 24, then sent out an invitation to actress Margot Robbie to come and support him. The Greek, who enjoys great support in Melbourne, surprised fans during his on-court interview after beating Czech Jiri Lehecka by admitting he was a big fan of Robbie, who most recently starred in the film “Babylon.” “Australia is such a great country,” Tsitsipas said. “I like a lot of Aussie things. One of my favorite actresses comes from here, Margot Robbie.” Pushed to shed more light on his apparent crush by interviewer Jim Courier, the 24-year-old Tsitsipas added: “It would be nice to see her here one day,” confirming that it was an invitation for her to come and watch. Tsitsipas will play Russian Karen Khachanov in his fourth Australian Open semifinal, hoping to go one step further than on the previous occasions. He will certainly be favorite against Khachanov and Tsitsipas says he feels in great shape, highlighting a new mental edge in his quest to win his first Grand Slam title. “I’m feeling great with my tennis. I don’t think I felt so good in a long time. I will definitely say yes to it,” the third seed told reporters. “I’m a different player, playing different. “My mentality is different. When I’m out on the court, I don’t really think of negatives, to be honest. I just go out there and play the game.” Tsitsipas, who reached the French Open final in 2021 when he lost to Novak Djokovic, has seen other young players move past him in the rankings, but said it does not concern him and was happy that the focus switches to others. “I passed through this myself. At some point it fades out a little bit ’cause you are an adult. You are not any more a kid. These guys are still sort of in the transition mode. They’re still there,” he said. “I’m very happy to be out on the court. I’m very happy to be performing. I’m very happy to hit some good shots. It’s just this whole dynamic that has made me very hungry and has created a lot of desire for me to be playing tennis.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-artificial-intelligence-no-joke/,[],"Sa unang araw ng online class ko ngayong semestre sa subject na Writing for New Media, inutusan namin ng mga estudyante ko na mag-rewrite ang artificial intelligence o AI ng isang sikat na 75-word paragraph. Pero ang dagdag na command, bukod sa pag-rewrite, ay gayahin ang narrative style ng isang sikat na manunulat: si Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Sa loob ng limang segundo, lumabas ang bersiyon sa distinct narrative style at tone ng yumaong writer na Kano. Naroon ang sundot ng dark humor ni Vonnegut Jr. Naroon ang tamang timing at placement ng pagpapatawa at irony sa paragraph. Kung nakapagbasa ka na ng maraming aklat ni Vonnegut Jr., malalaman mong kaboses nga niya ang bersiyong muling “isunulat” ng artifical intelligence software ng ChatGPT. “Rewrite the passage above using the narrative style of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.” Ganyan. Walang gatol. Sa loob ng ilang segundo, lumabas ang kaniyang bersiyon. Sa paraang parang itina-type din. Mabilis. At sabi nga ng isang estudyante ko, “scary.”

Nagpaliwanag pa ang AI hinggil sa kaniyang muling “pagsulat.” Pati na ang nuances ng humor na ginawa niya para maging katono ang awtor ng mga nobelang Breakfast of Champions at Slaughterhouse Five. Ipinaliwanag din ng AI kung sino si Vonnegut Jr. na ginaya niya ang estilo sa larangan ng pagsulat at kulturang popular. Naisip namin, bakit kailangang ipaliwanag kung sino at ano ang estilo ni Vonnegut Jr.? Poetics? Nagbigay uli kami ng command sa AI na kinilala ng Time Magazine bilang isa sa “2022’s most impressive technological innovations upon its release last November.” Gayahin naman ang isang popular na Tagalog writer. Ipina-rewrite namin ang parehong passage na unang ginaya ni Vonnegut Jr.

Sa nakabasa ng isa o dalawang aklat ng manunulat na Pinoy na ito, masasabing may hawig nga sa ginawa ng AI ang pagsusulat na sinanay na tipunin ang bilyong-bilyong salita sa kahit anong wika, dialect, sociolect (oo, aware din siya sa existence ng gay sociolect sa bansa), at pagi-pagitan nitong inilalagay natin sa internet, may saysay man o wala. Mula sa mga salitang ito, pinag-aaralan ng AI kung alin ang dapat magkakasama upang mabuo sa napakabilis na paraan ang sagot sa mga tanong at mga ipinapagawa namin sa klase. At kaiba sa kakayahan ng tao, pinipilit ng AI na may saysay ang isasagot bagamat humihingi siya ng pang-unawa at paumanhin sa kaniyang limitasyon sakaling may mali sa kaniyang detalye at paraan ng pagkakabuo sa pangungusap. Mabuti pa ang AI, humihingi ng paumanhin. Ang sumunod naming ipinagawa sa klase ko sa Writing for New Media sa antigong unibersidad sa Maynila, pasulatin ang AI ng nakakatawang tagline para makabenta ng kama at serbisyo ng punerarya. Hindi nakakatawa ang unang ibinigay na sagot ng AI. Pero naroon sa ibaba ng screen ang regenerate key sakaling gusto mong magbigay ng panibagong halimbawa sa iyong ipinapagawa. Muli, nagpaliwanag ang AI. Nasa nuances ng wika, kultura, at konteksto raw kung nakakatawa o hindi ang kaniyang sasabihin. “As a language model, I can generate text that is intended to be humorous based on patterns and examples in my training data, but I do not have the ability to perceive or experience emotions, including humor.” Binanggit din niya nang pahapyaw ang isa sa pundasyon ng teorya ng humor: ang incongruence o ang hindi inaasahang deviation ng wika upang maging katatatawanan. Lahat ito ay sinabi ng AI under five seconds. Paliwanag ng kompanyang namamahala sa AI: “We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.”

Dahil naka-share screen kami sa klase, real-time din na nakakapag-comment ang mga estudyante ko. May ibang natatawa, may ibang nababahala, at gaya ng isa, natakot. Bakit nga naman hindi, ang ginagawa ng tao sa matagal na oras ay kayang gawin ng AI sa loob lamang ng ilang segundo. Banta ito sa trabaho ng maraming ang kabuhayan ay lumikha ng teksto. Gaya ko. Kaya matapos ang klase, nang ako na lang nasa harap ng laptop, itinanong ko sa AI: Will AI put writers in obsolescence? Heto ang kaniyang sagot:

“It is unlikely that AI will completely replace human writers in the near future. While AI can be used to generate text, it is not yet advanced enough to fully replicate the creativity and nuance that human writers bring to their work. However, AI may be able to assist human writers by providing them with suggestions and helping them with research and editing tasks. Additionally, AI may also be used to generate certain types of text, such as news articles or product descriptions, which may lead to fewer job opportunities for human writers in those specific areas.” At dahil nagsusulat ako sa Tagalog at nagtuturo ng translation sa klase, ipinaulit ko ang sagot niya sa ating sariling wika, heto: “Hindi malamang na ang AI ang magpapalit sa mga manunulat ng tao sa malapit na hinaharap. Habang mayroon ngang AI na ginagamit para magbigay ng mga teksto, hindi pa ito sapat na napapaunlad upang makapantay sa galing at kahusayan na inaalok ng mga manunulat ng tao sa kanilang mga gawain. Subalit, pwede naman na magbigay ng mga suhestiyon ang AI sa mga manunulat ng tao, at tumulong sa kanila sa mga gawain ng pag-aaral at pag-eedit. Sa karagdagan, pwede ring gamitin ang AI para magbigay ng ibang uri ng teksto, tulad ng mga balitang artikulo o mga deskripsyon ng produkto, na maaaring magdulot ng mas kakaunting mga trabahong magagamit para sa mga manunulat ng tao sa mga partikular na lugar.”

Bukod sa napakagaspang pa ang salin sa Tagalog, nakompirma ng sagot ang pangamba ko: “AI may also be used to generate certain types of text, such as news articles or product descriptions, which may lead to fewer job opportunities for human writers in those specific areas.” Maaari na ring gamitin — o maaaring ginagamit na nga, sino ang makakakaalam! — ang AI sa customer support na magpapaliwanag sa more specific task at inquiry, mas detalyado, mas tiyak, mas eksaktong sagot sa mga pag-uusisang may kinalaman sa kahit ano. Hindi na lamang iyong nakakapunding chatbot ng mga bangko at telco sa Viber at SMS na napakalimitado ang sagot sa tanong. Ito mang salin ng kaniyang sariling sagot, let me remind you na ginawa niya in less than two seconds, ay itatama niya sa mga darating na panahon dahil sa kakayahan niyang mag-fine-tune ng naratibo. Hindi lang kabuhayan ng marami ang maaaring tamaan ng AI. Isyu rin ang AI-enabled paper sa akademya, sa knowledge production, at sa pagsasanay sa mag-aaral bilang isang responsableng bahagi ng lipunan at pamayanan. Katunayan ang paglalabas kamakailan ng isang statement ng UP Diliman Artificial Intelligence Program hinggil sa paggamit diumano ng AI para lumikha ng academic requirements.

Naniniwala akong wala pa sa karaniwang student handbook ang paggamit ng AI sa mga academic requirements ng mga unibersidad. Pero paano nga kung ang mag-aaral ay gumamit ng AI, masasabi ba itong plagiarism o pangongopya? Intellectual dishonesty? Paano kung ang interbensyon ng tao ay hanggang sa pagbibigay lang ng specific command para makuha ang inaasahang diskurso?

Dapat pag-aralan naming kabilang sa sektor ng edukasyon ang implikasyon ng paggamit sa AI ng kahit sinong kabilang sa sektor ng edukasyon (kahit kaming mga guro sa unibersidad ay dapat ding lumikha at manaliksik, kaya may temptation din sa posibleng paggamit ng AI). Lalong nadagdagan ang dapat harapin mula ngayon ng mga gaya kong guro at manunulat. Lalong dadami ang uban namin kaiisip kung paano makikibagay sa mundong unti-unti nang pinamumugaran ng AI bilang katuwang o pasimuno ng paglikha at paglunas sa mga suliranin sa hinaharap habang napakamahal pa rin ng sibuyas sa mundo ng karaniwang tao sa kasalukuyan. – Rappler.com Associate professor ng seminar in new media, research, at creative writing sa Faculty of Arts and Letters at sa Graduate School ng University of Santo Tomas si Joselito D.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/when-baby-turtles-give-jolt/,[],"“Pawikan! Ang dami (Sea turtles! There are lots of them)!” shouted Richmond Ubalde, the caretaker of Balay Prinsesa Beachcamp in Pao, Burgos, Pangasinan. It was already nighttime, but we hurriedly ran to where he was standing, thinking of many big turtles suddenly appearing and wading at the shore. But our thoughts proved to be wrong; to our surprise, we instead saw tiny black turtles slowly digging their way out of the sand. One by one, they came out until so many of them crawled around. The pawikans had hatched. The locals gathered around and noisily looked at them with surprise, awe, joy, and laughter. Mobile phones and flashlights were switched on to light them and, of course, to photograph them and take the usual selfies. They had not seen such an event in a very long time. Nobody knew what to do. One started picking up turtles and placing them in a basin. Another wanted to bring them directly to the sea, while another was shouting “Hayaan lang sila (Let them be)!” I texted and called some friends in the conservation sector, but it seemed they were already sleeping as it was already half past 10. My son said, “Leave them ‘di ba (right)? They’ll instinctively go to the sea kasi dun na ang dagat (because it’s already there).” He also sent me screenshots of notes about baby turtles. Friends would later text their advice of minimizing light sources to avoid disorientation of the baby turtles. I also called up my friend Nilo Tamoria, Southern Luzon regional executive director of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). He said to let them be, just secure their area to keep away dogs and other predators. And so we did. Nilo also messaged, “Kelangan din pabayaan na sila maglakad para sa geolocation nila…para sa pagbabalik uli nila when mature na to lay eggs. Kung mahahanap rin ‘yung pinag-itlugan, mark the location din.” (Let them walk already for their geolocation…so they can come back when they’re mature enough to lay eggs. If you can find where they laid the eggs, mark the location, too.) I told him the nest was just near and in front of the beach camp where we were staying in. The folks had placed plywoods around the nest to keep the dogs away. Those placed in the basin were returned to the sand. The Bantay Dagat also arrived at the site. I overheard them discussing, “Hayaan lang makapunta sa dagat, pero kumuha ng sampu para maipakita sa DENR at mai-record, ire-release din later.” (Just let them get to the sea, but pick out 10 to show to the DENR so they can be recorded; they will also be released later.) We went back inside the beach camp and continued our session. We were actually drinking beers, two-by-two gins, and wine while feasting over newly caught kinilaw na flying fish that Billy Boda, a local fisherman and construction worker, caught a while ago when Richard’s shout jolted us. The stories now were all about pawikans in the area. Pawikans used to come and go in Pao, laying hundreds of eggs and having tiny hatchlings crawling back to the sea. But the beach was heavily damaged for about a decade in the late 1990s when the shore was mined for its shiny little pebbles. “Binuracay ito, sir” said Manny Boda, another local fisherman and construction worker. Truckloads of shiny little pebbles in various sizes being hauled out were a daily occurrence. The “boracay” pebbles were sold to stores along Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Balintawak. When Major Domingo Doctor Jr. was elected town mayor in 2001, he put a stop to the pebble mining that made the beach look like the moon with many craters. But what followed next was the felling of coconut trees for their lumber. “Kanyugan daytoy idi, sir,” the folks said, referring to the beach as an area with numerous coconut trees. Now one can count the remaining coconut trees with his hands. Through the years, the beach slowly recovered and that night’s incident was truly a joyful event. Prior to that, Johmar Garcia, a fisherman and construction foreman, saw around 10 turtles about two days ago, and was quite surprised with the many house flies around the nesting site. At that time, he never thought that that place was a turtle’s nest. The locals have some good stories about the pawikans, like what Johmar said about his father and others who usually gathered turtle hatchlings to feed them for a week or two with bits of fresh fish they caught. They would then release the hatchlings to the waters. They thought that the hatchlings, if left alone, would not even make it to the shore because of the rough stones that lined the shore. They also told us of their belief that the parent turtles are usually at a distance from the shore waiting for their babies after their eggs hatch, which is usually about 50 to 60 days after their eggs are laid. Director Tamoria said there are about 110 to 115 eggs per clutch. Someone told us that night that they counted about 120 hatchlings. He said he already alerted Pangasinan Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officer (PENRO) Raymond Rivera of the hatchlings. But there are also not so good stories, like the ones told by my cousins Harry Torres and Ferdinand Espanol about turtles being openly hauled, sold, and butchered in the public market, and their eggs boiled and eaten. The practice was stopped during the time of mayor Alberto Guiang in the late ’90s. But even if the practice was halted, pawikans were still poached in that part of the West Philippine Sea by Chinese fishermen. They have seen Chinese vessels full of poached pawikans towed to shore by Philippine Coast Guards, who were on guard mainly for drug and motorcycle smuggling and dynamite fishing, among others. At 7:30 am the following day, Director Tamoria relayed the message from PENRO Rivera that the Alaminos City Community Environment and Natural Resources Officer (CENRO) team was already on-site. We went to the Bantay Dagat station to meet the team of Forest Technician Kevin Lingaling and Park Maintenance Foreman Jerry Valenzuela. Nick Braga, head of the Bantay Dagat of Burgos, told us that he also alerted the same offices last night. At the Bantay Dagat station, we saw a basin full of hatchlings swimming. They apparently gathered about 84 hatchlings during the night while the rest were able to go to the sea. When the Alaminos CENRO team arrived, they immediately released them to the sea. This was my very first experience seeing turtle hatchlings wriggle towards their habitat. Braga reported that just the other day, they also released 74 hatchlings in Cabongaoan beach, a nearby beach sitio in the same barangay. Unlike Pao, whose white beach is underdeveloped because the road leading to it remains one-way, rough, and unpaved, Cabongaoan’s popular beach is teeming with resorts as the road near the beach is all paved and two-way. The baby turtles were identified as olive ridley sea turles (Lepidochelys olivacea). They are the second smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles, and yet they are classified as endangered by both the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the DENR. This species is known for their unique synchronized mass nesting, popularly known as arribadas, where thousands of female turtles come together on the same beach to lay eggs. No wonder the hatchlings found in the same long stretch of Burgos shoreline were found and seen almost at the same time. There are seven turtle species all over the world and the Philippines has five of them: green sea, hawksbill, olive ridley, leatherback, and loggerhead turtles. All of these turtles are classified endangered by IUCN, with the hawksbill as critically endangered. The confusion on how to handle hatchlings of this protected turtle species that night was one big realization for the need to incorporate in basic education the proper and appropriate way to handle not only the baby turtles but also when the parent turtles come to shore to lay their eggs. I was assured by Braga that they had relayed that to the Department of Education, and I was glad to hear that, and I hope that public school teachers of Burgos are teaching their students about pawikans. Still, there is a need to orient visitors, tourists, and the local folk on the proper and correct attitude and handling of this endangered species. I would suggest that barangays and towns with shores known to have nesting sites of turtles and hatchlings be made aware of these procedures, just like the information in the links that my son provided me. The local folk may be aware of these matters at heart, but posters and information and education materials must be present at beaches, especially if these are tourist sites, for the awareness and education of tourists, guests, and visitors as well. These campaigns must always be undertaken year-round, but most especially during November to February, when turtles lay eggs and when hatchlings go back to the sea. I am sure the incumbent Mayor Jesster Allan Valenzuela will certainly lead this initiative, just as former mayor Ronald Ngayawan led the weekly beach cleanups during his term. Come to think of it, I have not experienced being oriented, nor have I seen posters and information materials of these turtles at beaches and resorts of Burgos for the many times I have visited my mother’s hometown. All local governments may need to be encouraged to launch an awareness campaign to save and conserve turtles. Let’s save our turtles! Let’s make our beaches friendly to them, as shared space between man and nature. – Rappler.com Alain Pascua is the author of “Haring Ibon: The Great Philippine Eagle,” the only book that singularly focuses on the Philippine national bird.

The Labour party elected former COVID-19 Response and Police minister Hipkins, 44, to lead the party and the country on Sunday. Ardern, 42, resigned last week, saying she had “no more in the tank” to lead the country. Hundreds gathered in the grounds of Parliament as Ardern left for the final time, hugging each of her members of parliament in turn, with many looking visibly emotional. She then traveled to Government House, where she tendered her resignation to King Charles’ representative in New Zealand, Governor General Cindy Kiro. Hipkins and his deputy Carmel Sepuloni – the first person of Pacific Islander descent to hold the role – were then sworn in, in a ceremony lasting a few minutes. Hours later, Hipkins met with journalists after his first cabinet meeting as Prime Minister. Bombarded with questions about the cost of living hours after fresh price data came in above analyst forecasts, Hipkins said he would make the issue central to his policy agenda. However, he pushed back against announcing new policies immediately, saying he would make haste but not create policy “on the fly.” “New Zealanders will absolutely see in the coming weeks and months that cost of living is right at the heart of our work program,” he said. “It is the number one priority that we are facing as a government and they will see tangible evidence of that. Obviously I’m not going to make it up on the fly, as I’ve already indicated.” Hipkins said he would honor commitments already made for the current term of parliament. Known as “Chippy,” Hipkins is well-known to New Zealanders for his competence in tackling COVID-19, though he acknowledged some mistakes in handling the pandemic and faces a tough battle to retain power in an October general election. A 1News-Kantar poll released in December had Labour’s support falling to 33% from 40% at the start of 2022, meaning the party would not be able to form a majority even with traditional coalition partner the Green Party at 9%.

The Dinagyang Festival is held annually on the fourth Sunday of January in honor of the Child Jesus Señor Sto. Niño. The celebration is a fusion of religious and secular events that happen all around the city. Religious activities include the nine-day novena mass, the fluvial procession which also reenacts the arrival of the image of Sto. Niño from Cebu, and the religious SadSad in the San Jose Parish in Plaza Libertad. The secular side of the festival highlights the Ilonggos’ rich culture and history through the Ati-Tribe competition, which has been ongoing for more than 50 years. The dances performed evoke the pagan traditions of the original settlers of Panay Island, the Ati-Tribe, and the story of how they were introduced to Catholicism via the arrival of the image of Señor Sto. Niño. Last 2020 and 2021, the Association of Tourism Officers of the Philippines (ATOP) awarded Dinagyang Festival as the Best Tourism Event of the country, for still continuing the festivities virtually despite the ongoing health crisis. This year, the Iloilo Festivals Foundation, Inc (IFFI), the main organizers of the festival, introduced the “ILOmination” Tribes Competition as their newest spectacle. It is similar to the traditional Ati-Tribe competition, but held on the night of January 21, with illuminated costumes lighting up the famous Diversion Road of Iloilo City.

Constante Foronda, head of Isabela’s Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, told radio DZBB that clear weather on Wednesday would allow for the search to continue after the plane went missing on Tuesday afternoon, January 24, with six people on board, including the pilot. The Cessna plane, with tail number RP-C1174,  took off at 2:16 pm from the Cauayan Domestic Airport in Isabela and was expected to arrive at 3 pm in the town of Maconacon, Isabela.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/in-my-mothers-skin-review-haunting-chilling-thought-provoking-horror/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"This is a spoiler-free review. Throughout Kenneth Dagatan’s horror film set during World War II in the Philippines, we never see any of the Japanese or American forces battling for control of the country. Instead, Dagatan points his camera at a family in a dismal state – in particular, their undiminished reliance on faith. What follows is a deconstruction of that faith, with shades of grey gradually spreading across the remaining vestiges of morality in wartime. The inevitability of the Japanese forces spells looming death and occupation, but even before they arrive, the harbinger of the family’s destruction comes early, in the form of hope. The hope that the country will be saved from the Japanese, the Americans, and all those who would invade it becomes a double-edged sword in In My Mother’s Skin. As the young girl, Tala (Felicity Kyle Napuli), meets an Engkanto (or Filipino fairy), she is immediately beguiled by offers of salvation and good fortune, a means to escape from the terrors of man and to maintain the purity of her soul. But this isn’t a happy fairy tale, and the film’s many villains know that. So they use faith as manipulation, hope as an illusion, and innocence as subservience. This makes the horror of Dagatan’s film layered and nuanced to historical context. It’s a haunting, chilling, and thought-provoking kind of horror that burns itself in your mind. Like in his first full-length film, Ma, Dagatan once again extracts horror from magical realism, through the lens of children who unknowingly make deals with the devil. Here, instead of an ominous cave, the bearer of Faustian bargains takes the shape of a fairy (Jasmine Curtis-Smith) dressed as a Santo Niño figure appearing in and out of an overgrown chapel. The costume design and practical effects are unsettling, crossing the line between tangible and intangible. Curtis-Smith’s fairy is adorned with intricate handmade filigree, tassels, and beads, which are made even more uncanny by the cicada wings encircling the crown and the subtle malevolent expressions from the actress. Dagatan, now clearly adept at grisly effects (see his mastery at this craft in his first horror short Sanctissima), draws a physically exertive performance from Beauty Gonzales. The house — the same one used in Oro Plata Mata, and where most of the horror of In My Mother’s Skin takes place — heightens the film’s atmosphere of grief and dread. Instead of overcrowded halls and lavish parties, the house is emptied of its opulence. In it are Tala (Felicity Kyle Napuli), her brother Bayani (James Mavie Estrella), their family servant Amor (Angeli Bayani), and Gonzales as their mother, Ligaya. Romualdo (Arnold Reyes), the family patriarch, departs to negotiate with the Japanese and inadvertently kickstarts the incursion of insidious actors into his home. Gold, likely referencing the myth of the Yamashita treasure, is hidden inside the house, and Antonio (Ronnie Lazaro) takes this as an opportunity to try and steal it. Meanwhile, Tala’s deal with the fairy causes her mother to act strangely, leading to a third-act climax that is utterly stomach-turning. While it seems like a straightforward story at first glance, delving deeper into its background reveals a rich and complex narrative. In My Mother’s Skin truly comes to life when viewed through the lens of the underlying conflict it portrays: the exploitation of colonial forces and their lasting ramifications on the purity of the Filipino soul. The trio of Japanese, American, and Spanish imperial powers have all attempted to colonize the Philippines in the past and offered their own versions of salvation. The Santo Niño-like fairy evokes the influence of Catholicism and the hypocrisy of Spanish friars hiding under the guise of benevolence. It’s no mistake that Dagatan shoots many scenes of the family kneeling in front of a religious altar; it’s an act of worship but also an act of submission, an invisible presence that strangles them, much like the unseen soldiers heard only in faint gunshots. Importantly, we observe how this affects young children, who lose their innocence and must deal with unspeakable anguish. The performance of Napuli in the lead role is phenomenal; she uses her theater experience to convey the emotional weight and raw vulnerability of a child forced to confront harsh realities and deadly bargains. Her co-lead, Beauty Gonzales, is remarkable in equal measure, her body convulsing with each contraction and retching streams of blood from her mouth in a convincing manner. If anything, the film’s blemishes lie in how quickly the boiling point arrives, whereas longer films like Oro Plata Mata and Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos savor their bounty of character interactions, examining clashing moral positions in the war. It also takes a page from Pan’s Labyrinth, specifically in its fairy tale approach and the inclusion of mythological creatures. But in that film, escapism plays a key role in the lead’s fantastical world, but here, Tala’s escapism as a means to cope is a bit underplayed, focusing more on the desperation provoked by war as a motivating factor for trusting the fairy. But with beautiful visual compositions, remarkable sound design, and some truly affecting performances, In My Mother’s Skin is psychologically and intellectually stimulating, the absolute best in the horror market. It serves as an exclamation point for what is shaping up to be an exciting and galvanizing genre career for Kenneth Dagatan. And if his past films full of flesh-eating, vomit-spewing, self-cannibalizing monsters are any indication, then everyone should take notice. – Rappler.com In My Mother’s Skin will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video later this year."
https://www.rappler.com/technology/united-states-targets-google-online-ad-business-monopoly/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – The US Justice Department accused Alphabet Inc’s Google on Tuesday, January 24, of abusing its dominance in digital advertising, threatening to dismantle a key business at the heart of one of Silicon Valley’s most successful internet companies. The government said Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, tackling a business that generated about 12% of Google’s revenues in 2021, but also plays a vital role in the search engine and cloud company’s overall sales. “Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful means to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,” the antitrust complaint said. Google, whose advertising business is responsible for about 80% of its revenue, said the government was “doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.” The federal government has said its Big Tech investigations and lawsuits are aimed at leveling the playing field for smaller rivals to a group of powerful companies that includes Amazon.com, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Apple Inc. “By suing Google for monopolizing advertising technology, the DOJ today aims at the heart of the internet giant’s power,” said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge. “The complaint lays out the many anticompetitive strategies from Google that have held our internet ecosystem back.” Tuesday’s lawsuit by the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, follows a 2020 antitrust lawsuit brought against Google during the term of Donald Trump, a Republican. The 2020 lawsuit alleged violations of antitrust law in how the company acquires or maintains its dominance with its monopoly in online search and is scheduled to go to trial in September. Eight states joined Tuesday’s lawsuit, including Google’s home state of California. California State Attorney General Rob Bonta said that Google’s practices have “stifled creativity in a space where innovation is crucial.” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said that Google’s dominance had led to higher fees for advertisers and less money for publishers with ad space to offer. “We are taking action by filing this lawsuit to unwind Google’s monopoly and restore competition to the digital advertising business,” he said in a statement. Google shares were down 1.9% on Tuesday. In addition to its well-known search, which is free, Google makes revenue through its interlocking ad tech businesses. The government asked for the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager suite, including Google’s ad exchange, AdX. Google Ad Manager is a suite of tools including one that allows websites to offer advertising space for sale and an exchange that serves a marketplace that automatically matches advertisers with those publishers. Advertisers and website publishers have complained that Google has not been transparent about where ad dollars go, specifically how much goes to publishers and how much to Google. The lawsuit raises concerns about certain products in the ad tech stack, where publishers and advertisers use Google’s tools to buy and sell ad space on other websites. That business was about $31.7 billion in 2021 or 12.3% of Google’s total revenue. About 70% of that revenue goes to publishers. An ad tech divestiture “may not be a game changer but it could be sneaky important to Google’s ad targeting capability,” said Paul Gallant with the Cowen Washington Research Group. “It connects to all of Google’s other businesses and ties them together. I think Google might be more concerned about losing ad tech down the road than people might think,” Gallant said. The company made a series of purchases, including DoubleClick in 2008 and AdMob in 2009, to help make it a dominant player in online advertising. While Google remains the market leader by a long shot, its share of US digital ad revenue has been eroding, falling to 28.8% last year from 36.7% in 2016, according to Insider Intelligence. The Justice Department asked for a jury to decide the case, which was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The lawsuit lays out a number of Google’s attempts to dominate the advertising market. The complaint discussed header bidding, which was a way that companies could bypass Google to bid on ad space on websites. It lays out a series of projects including one dubbed “Project Poirot” named after Agatha Christie’s master detective, Hercule Poirot. The project “was designed to identify and respond effectively to ad exchanges that had adopted header bidding technology.” The 149-page complaint said Google doubled down after Project Poirot’s initial success in manipulating its advertisers’ spending to reduce competition from rival ad exchanges. Rivals AppNexus/Xandr lost 31% of DV360 advertiser spending, Rubicon would lose 22%, OpenX would lose 42%, and Pubmatic would lose 26%, the complaint said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/california-massacres-heighten-immigrants-fears-gun-violence-united-states/,[],"CALIFORNIA, USA – America was supposed to be a place of safety for Jose Romero when he arrived some two years ago to work on a California farm alongside other immigrants from Mexico and China. Romero was killed on Monday, January 23, shot dead by a gunman along with six other farm workers in Half Moon Bay, just south of San Francisco. Even in a nation all too familiar with gun violence, the shooting was stunning, coming just two days after another gunman opened fire at a ballroom in Monterey Park, an Asian American enclave outside Los Angeles. In all, 18 people died in the back-to-back shootings, rattling two close-knit communities that had drawn immigrants seeking opportunities. “You look to improve your life and then you end up with this,” said Romero’s cousin, Jose Juarez, quiet and sullen on Tuesday as he took a break from cooking at a Mexican taqueria in a Half Moon Bay strip mall. That police said the attacks were carried out by assailants known within the community – Huu Can Tran, 72, frequented the Monterey Park dance studio and Chunli Zhao, 66, worked on a Half Moon Bay farm – only added to the sense of fear felt by immigrant groups that have been the targets of racist rhetoric and attacks in the United States. As many as 32% of Asian immigrants and 23% of Latino immigrants in California say they are “very worried” about becoming victims of gun violence in their adopted home – three times the level of fear reported by people born in the United States, according to data gathered by the University of California, Los Angeles, and shared with Reuters. The massacres heightened those concerns for some people. Antonio Perez, who now lives in Half Moon Bay after moving from Mexico in 1983, said he feels stuck between cartel violence in his homeland and gun violence in the United States. “We never expected this kind of extreme here,” Perez said, shaking his head. “What a tragedy.” About 380 miles (610 km) south, in Monterey Park, residents expressed fears in the aftermath of the dance hall shooting that the poison of America’s gun culture and epidemic of mass shootings was infecting Asian-American communities. “Americans can have guns, there are guns everywhere,” said Frank Hio, 36, who is originally from China. “It’s dangerous here.” In the thriving suburb known for its Asian stores and restaurants, some people expressed anguish that the gunman came from within the community. “The shooters are Asian, and the victims are Asian,” said Rolando Favis, 72, who moved to the United States from the Philippines 38 years ago. But many also said they had been more fearful of their safety for several years, following the rise in hate crimes against Asians in the wake of the pandemic and rhetoric from then-President Donald Trump blaming China. In the aftermath of the pandemic, Asian American gun ownership increased. A third of those who owned guns said they carried weapons more frequently amid the anti-Asian incidents, and another third said they kept guns loaded or unlocked in their homes, according to a study by the University of Michigan. At the Euro Arms Inc gun store in Alhambra, three miles (5 km) from the scene of the Monterey Park massacre, store assistant Wesley Chan said gun sales had risen since the start of the pandemic, including among Asian Americans in the area. “Everyone was scared and wanted to protect themselves,” he said. About 9.3% of Asian immigrants keep guns in their homes in California, compared with 5.6% of Latino immigrants and 12% of white immigrants, said Ninez Ponce, the lead researcher on the UCLA study. Overall, about 17.6% of Californians of all backgrounds keep a gun at home. Both Tran and Zhao used semi-automatic pistols. Police have not said where or when they were acquired."

The Netflix movie, the first German version of the epic 1929 novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, was one of the most recognized films in the 2023 Oscar nods, behind Everything Everywhere All at Once with 11 and tied with The Banshees of Inisherin. “Especially after a really hard movie to make, it’s just a really nice gift to get,” said director Edward Berger, who was filming in Rome when he learned of the nominations. Producer Malte Grunert said that after the film’s 14 BAFTA nominations last week they had “no clue whether that would translate into Academy Awards nominations.” When the film premiered in September at the Toronto International Film Festival, Berger had said he wanted to share how the world wars started by his country had led to a collective generational scar on German society. All Quiet on the Western Front tells the story of young students who go to World War One blinded by right-wing propaganda and nationalist hate, something that Grunert says resonates with modern times. “It makes people believe that war might be an adventure and appropriate means to solve a conflict when it isn’t an adventure and it means death and destruction and suffering,” said Grunert. “And to remind us of that felt like a relevant message, even before the war in Ukraine.” The movie is also nominated for best international feature film, adapted screenplay, cinematography, visual effects and production design. The first film adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was made in Hollywood and was banned in Germany shortly after its release in 1930, while Remarque’s book was burned and he had to flee. “Hollywood became a place of refuge for so many artists that had to escape from Europe,” Grunert said. “To be even remotely
connected to this tradition is something that would make us very proud.” – Rappler.com"

Huang is one of the most prominent figures in artificial intelligence because Nvidia’s chips are widely used in the field, including in a supercomputer that Microsoft Corp built for startup OpenAI, in which Microsoft said Monday it was making a multibillion-dollar investment. Huang was speaking at an event in Stockholm, where officials said Tuesday they were upgrading Sweden’s fastest supercomputer using tools from Nvidia to, among other things, develop what is known as a large language model that will be fluent in Swedish. “Remember, if you take a step back and think about all of the things in life that are either convenient, enabling or wonderful for society, it also has probably some potential harm,” Huang said. Lawmakers such as Ted Lieu, a Democratic from California in the U.S. House of Representatives, have called for the creation of a US federal agency that would regulate AI. In an opinion piece in the New York Times on Monday, Lieu argued that systems such as facial recognition used by law enforcement agencies possibly can misidentify innocent people from minority groups. Huang said engineering standards bodies would need to establish standards for building safe AI systems, similar to how medical bodies set rules for the safe practice of medicine. But he also said laws and social norms would play a key role for AI. “What is the social norm for using it? What the legal norms (are) for using it have to be developed,” Huang said. “Everything is evolving right now.

The five men who were killed were identified as Yu Lun Kao, 72; Chia Ling Yau, 76; Valentino Marcos Alvero, 68; Wen Tau Yu, 64; and Ming Wei Ma, 72. The Chinese consulate in Los Angeles said Chinese citizens were among the dead. Taiwan’s consulate in Los Angeles said two Taiwanese expatriates also were killed. Tom’s family said she died on Sunday, January 22, after being taken to hospital in critical condition following the shooting, according to a statement seen by ABC News. Tom was remembered as a “hard-working mother, wife and grandmother who loved to dance.” “To those who knew her, she was someone who always went out of her way to give to others,” the statement said. In a statement on Twitter, Alvero’s family said he was a devout Catholic who loved ballroom dancing and was the life of any party. “Overnight, we became unwilling members of a community who has to mourn the loss of our loved ones due to gun violence. We are left frustrated, stuck with this vicious cycle,” the family said. Seven people were killed and one person was in critical condition after a 66-year-old man on Monday, January 23, attacked two mushroom farms near the resort town of Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, police said. The victims – six men and two woman – were all Asian or Hispanic adults, according to the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office. Jose and Pedro Romero, brothers who migrated from Mexico two years ago and worked at Mountain Mushroom Farm, were among those shot on Monday, their cousin Jose Juarez told Reuters. Jose died and his younger brother Pedro is hospitalized, Juarez said. Jose has a wife and children back in Mexico, he added. “You look to improve your life and then you end up with this,” said Juarez, quiet and sullen as he took a break from cooking at a Mexican restaurant in a Half Moon Bay strip mall. The family is now looking for financial help in order to repatriate Jose’s body to Mexico, he said. Farm worker Marciano Martinez-Jimenez was one of three people shot dead at Concord Farms, his nephew Carlos Martinez-Maya told ABC7 news. Martinez-Jimenez’s death was confirmed to Reuters by Antonio Perez, who works at a Latino grocery store in Half Moon Bay and was schoolmates with him in their village in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Perez was stunned when, upon arriving in Half Moon Bay in the late 1990s, he saw Martinez-Jimenez again at a party. “I was so happy. We spoke about when we’d arrived here. And he said, ‘Come sit down with us,'” Perez recounted. Martinez-Jimenez was hardworking, quiet and sought to avoid conflict, Perez said. “Last Thursday or so, I saw him for the last time in the store,” Perez said. “He came to buy cheese.” The San Mateo County Coroner’s Office declined to comment on the identities of the victims in the Half Moon Bay shooting. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/ship-capsize-japan-january-25-2023/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – Thirteen crew members were rescued on Wednesday, January 25, from a cargo ship that sank off southwestern Japan during fierce winter winds, with planes and ships, including private vessels, searching for the remaining nine. The vessel, the 6,651-ton Hong Kong-registered “Jintian” issued a distress call late on Tuesday, January 24, the Japan Coast Guard said. Media reported a person on the ship said it was listing and taking on water, and later reports said the 22 crew members – all Chinese or Myanmar nationals – had transferred to lifeboats. There was no immediate word on what caused the vessel, which was carrying lumber, to capsize. A Coast Guard spokesperson said winds were strong at the time the distress signal was received at around 11:15 p.m. on Tuesday. The Coast Guard immediately sought assistance from patrol ships and aircraft in the vicinity, the west of Nagasaki city, top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno said. The ship sank at 2:46 a.m. (17:46 GMT on Tuesday), he added, quoting other vessels in the area. The Coast Guard “is also seeking cooperation from the Self-Defense Forces, South Korean Coast Guard, and vessels sailing near the waters,” Matsuno said at a regular news conference. He said the five crew members who were rescued were all Chinese but had no further information on their condition. A Japan Coast Guard spokesperson told Reuters the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the Korea Coast Guard rescued another eight members of the crew. Earlier, the Japan Coast Guard said it had discovered four crew floating in the water and that they were rescued by a private vessel, some 110 km west of the Danjo islands. The Coast Guard could not confirm reports the crew was in lifeboats. Western parts of Japan were battered by winter storms that brought freezing, windy conditions on Tuesday. The area where the ship sank is between Nagasaki and South Korea’s Jeju island, where hundreds of flights were canceled on Tuesday because of harsh weather conditions. A ship ran aground in heavy wind off the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa on Tuesday. The 19 crew members were rescued, media reported. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/things-to-know-about-chikungunya-virus/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) reported 600 cases of Chikungunya infection across the country in 2022, a 552% increase compared to the 92 cases reported in 2021. In its latest surveillance report released this January, the DOH said CALABARZON, Central Visayas, and Davao recorded the highest cases with 155, 127, and 114 cases, respectively. With the increase in infection rates, here’s what you need to know about the disease so you can protect yourself against it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Chikungunya is a “mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).” The virus is carried by mosquitoes of two types: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus – which can also transmit dengue and Zika viruses. The virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, more infection happens when an uninfected mosquito bites an infected person, causing the mosquito to ingest the virus. That mosquito then replicates the virus over several days, which can be transmitted to another human that is bitten. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) also noted that transmission of the virus can be possible through blood and in utero (mother to baby) transmissions, too. Because Chikungunya’s symptoms are not so different from dengue and Zika viruses, cases of it can be misdiagnosed. According to WHO, typically four to eight days after being bitten, an infected person may have distinguishing symptoms such as an “abrupt onset of fever, accompanied by severe joint pain.” The joint pain can often cause weakening, thus the name Chikungunya, which means “to become contorted” in Kimakonde language. It describes the stooped appearance of suffering, infected people. The pain “usually lasts for a few days, but can prolong up to weeks, months, or even years.” However, without the significant joint pain, other symptoms of Chikungunya are the same as those of dengue and Zika. These include: joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. A person can confirm infection through a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of blood samples. Unfortunately, Chikungunya has no specific antiviral treatment, and a vaccine to prevent it has yet to be licensed. Both the WHO and CDC say in their websites that rest, intake of lots of fluids, and some over-the-counter medicines can help manage and relieve symptoms. Analgesics and antipyretics such as paracetamol or acetaminophen can be taken for pain relief and the reduction of fever. However, a person may only take it once infection is confirmed as not being dengue. Otherwise, these drugs can increase the risk of bleeding. An already infected person must prevent being bitten by more mosquitoes especially during the first week of Chikungunya infection. During this period, the virus can be found in the person’s blood, and a mosquito biting an infected person makes that mosquito a virus carrier. Mosquito bite prevention may include minimizing skin exposure by wearing clothing that covers legs and arms and by using an insect repellent. Applying screens on windows and doors might be helpful too. Most importantly, controlling the growth of mosquitoes by reducing breeding sites by emptying and cleaning containers, and disposing of waste will help prevent the spread of Chikungunya. Chikungunya-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs in containers with stagnant water, that’s why checking and emptying water containers is one way of preventing the spread of the disease. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-25-2023/,[],"Germany cleared the way on Wednesday, January 25, for Europe to send scores of battle tanks to Ukraine, and Washington was poised make a similar announcement – moves hailed by Kyiv as a potential turning point in the war and condemned by Moscow as escalation. Kyiv has been calling for months for Western main battle tanks that would give its forces greater firepower, protection, and mobility to break through Russian defensive lines and potentially reclaim territory occupied by the invaders. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration, reminded Kyiv’s allies that it wanted tanks in the hundreds, adding on Telegram: “This is what is going to become a real punching fist of democracy.” Germany, previously the West’s holdout, said it would send an initial company of 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks from its own stocks, and also approve shipments by other European countries. The overall aim would be to supply Ukraine with two battalions of Leopards, typically comprising three or four companies, each with around 14 tanks. Berlin said the first would arrive within three or four months, and that it would also provide training, ammunition and maintenance. “This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability. We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. Germany’s decision immediately paves the way for pledges from other countries that also use the same tanks. Spain and the Netherlands said they too could send Leopards and Norway was reported to be considering the matter. Poland and Finland had already pledged to send some as soon as Berlin approved. Britain has offered a company of 14 of its comparable Challengers and France is considering sending its Leclercs. The decision to send tanks lifts one of the last taboos in Western support: providing weapons that have a mainly offensive rather than defensive purpose. Two sources in the United States said Washington would announce later on Wednesday that it would provide dozens of its M1 Abrams battle tanks. Russia’s embassy in Germany denounced Berlin’s “extremely dangerous decision”, which it said could draw Germany into the war – something Berlin explicitly denied. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any US tanks sent to Ukraine would “burn like all the rest”. Moscow says supplies of modern offensive weaponry to Ukraine will prolong the war and postpone what it says will be its inevitable victory. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador in Washington, said deliveries of US battle tanks would be a “another blatant provocation”. In the past week, Russia has ramped up its threats, with Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, saying openly that a nuclear power that faced defeat could use nuclear weapons. Western officials who support sending the tanks have dismissed Moscow’s threats as bluster, saying Russia is already waging war at full tilt and has been deterred from attacking NATO or using nuclear arms. “The right decision by NATO Allies and friends to send main battle tanks to Ukraine. Alongside Challenger 2s, they will strengthen Ukraine’s defensive firepower,” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on Twitter. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted a message of thanks to Scholz for a “big step towards stopping Russia”. Last week, allies pledged billions of dollars’ worth of new military aid including hundreds of armored fighting vehicles and troop carriers – seen as more effective for attacking when used alongside tanks to burst through enemy lines. Ukraine acknowledged that its forces had withdrawn from Soledar, a small salt-mining town in the east that Russia had claimed to capture more than a week ago in its biggest gain for more than half a year. The town is close to Bakhmut, a larger city that has been the focus of an intense Russian assault for weeks. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said units of Russia’s Wagner contract militia were now moving forward inside Bakhmut, with fighting on the outskirts and in neighborhoods recently held by Ukraine. Reuters could not verify the situation there. In the 11 months since it invaded, Russia has killed thousands of civilians, forced millions from their homes and reduced entire cities to rubble. It says its “special military operation” was necessary to stem a security threat arising from Ukraine’s ties to the West, which it now portrays as seeking to destroy it. Kyiv and its allies say Ukraine never threatened Russia, and the invasion is a war of aggression to subdue its neighbor and seize land. Ukraine defeated Russia’s troops on the outskirts of Kyiv last year and later drove them out of swathes of occupied land. But Moscow still occupies around a sixth of Ukraine, and has declared this territory part of Russia. Ukraine says it will not stop fighting until it recaptures all its territory. The front line has been largely frozen in place for two months despite heavy losses on both sides, with both believed to be planning new offensives for the spring. – Rappler.com"

Police were called to a Circle K in Yakima, Washington, about 3:30 am when three people, who have not been identified, were found dead, Chief Matt Murray told reporters. Two victims were shot inside the store in what authorities said appeared to be a random act of violence, and a third was shot outside. “It appears to be a random situation. There was no apparent conflict between the parties,” Murray said. “The male just walked in and started shooting.” After opening fire in the store, the suspect, identified as Jarid Haddock, 21, ran across the street and fired into a vehicle, forcing the driver to move to the passenger seat. The suspect stole the car and fled, police said. Following an hours-long manhunt, a relative of Haddock called authorities to a location behind warehouses where Haddock was hiding. Gunshots were heard while police approached and a man who identified himself as Haddock was found wounded, Murray said. No officers were injured or used any force, he added.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/ireland-toasts-record-success-oscar-2023-nominations/,[],"DUBLIN, Ireland – Ireland celebrated a record 14 Oscar nominations on Tuesday, January 24, scooping five of the 20 acting spots up for grabs and for the first time earning a nod for a feature film made in the native Irish language. The haul – which included nine nominations for The Banshees of Inisherin, the dark comedy filmed on a remote island off the western Irish coast – was the top item on Ireland’s flagship evening news program, relegating politics to second place. “Congratulations to all the Irish Oscar nominations. It is fantastic to see Irish creative talent achieving well deserved recognition on the world stage,” Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Twitter. “Comhghairdeas mór leis An Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl) – the first Irish language movie ever to receive a nomination,” he added, using the native tongue to congratulate Ireland’s first ever nominee in the prestigious international film category. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan all earned their first Oscar ever nominations for The Banshees of Inisherin, while Paul Mescal joined Farrell in the best actor shortlist for the independent movie Aftersun. Only the United States and Britain – with populations and film industries that dwarf Ireland’s – have been represented by five or more acting nominees in a single year in the awards’ near 100-year history, according to Reuters calculations. Ireland was also well represented in the craft categories, including best visual effects and editing while former winner Martin McDonagh added to his growing Oscar CV with best director and best original screenplay nods for Banshees. The film is also among the bookmakers’ favorites for best picture. Particular pride was saved for An Cailín Ciúin, a film that has put a language spoken day-to-day by a small minority on the global stage and beat filmmakers such as four-time Oscar winner Alejandro Inarritu to the final international film selection. “There was perhaps a notion out there that to make a film in the Irish language was a dead end creatively or commercially. I think that notion has been absolutely dispelled now,” director Colm Bairéad told the Irish Times as cast and crew celebrated in a local Dublin cinema. “There’s no reason that Irish language filmmakers should limit their ambitions, they should be making films for the world.” – Rappler.com"

Cameron was joined – in omission – by another box-office standout, actor Tom Cruise, whose starring role in Top Gun: Maverick wowed audiences but was overlooked in the best actor category. Both films did, however, land on the list of 10 nominees for best picture, joining audience-pleasing films such as the biopic Elvis and multiverse adventure comedy Everything Everywhere All at Once In a bid to remain relevant to younger audiences, the Academy expanded the number of nominees for best picture to up to 10 more than a dozen years ago and has nominated commercially successful films, breaking from a history of honoring movies and performances its members deem as exhibiting cinematic merit. Another notable snub from the best picture list was Babylon, La La Land director Damien Chazelle’s ambitious ode to old Hollywood. Its A-list stars Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt were also left off the list of acting nominations. The Oscars also have been criticized in years past for their lack of diversity among nominees, sparking a move to broaden Academy membership. This year none of the nominees for best director are women. Viola Davis, who won acclaim for her performance in The Woman King, was bypassed in the lead actress category, which included such surprise nominees as Andrea Riseborough, who portrayed an addict in To Leslie. Danielle Deadwyler similarly was overlooked for her breakout role as Mamie Till-Mobley, mother of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old who was abducted and lynched by white supremacists in 1955, in the movie Till. One of the most successful recording artists of the era, Taylor Swift, also was snubbed by the Academy.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/angela-bassett-marvel-first-actor-nominated-oscar/,[],"LOS ANGELES, USA – Angela Bassett made history on Tuesday, January 24, as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe star to be nominated for an acting Oscar for her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever role as Queen Ramonda. After being nominated in the best supporting actress category, Bassett paid tribute to the character she portrayed. “Wakanda Forever’s Queen Ramonda is a character that touched my spirit because she is a mother and a leader who must care for her grieving nation as much as she cares for her family in mourning,” Bassett said in a statement. Bassett is a favorite to win at the Oscar ceremony on March 12, having already secured a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice award for the role. The film secured four other nominations, including for visual effects and costume design. Bassett was previously nominated for a best actress Academy Award for her portrayal as Tina Turner in the biopic What’s Love Got To Do With It.“ Disney’s Black Panther sequel sold around $330 million in tickets and set a November record in the United States and Canada. In the sequel, the character King T’Challa dies at the opening, a script change made after actor Chadwick Boseman passed away from cancer in 2020 just before filming started. Marvel decided not to recast T’Challa. Instead, writer and director Ryan Coogler crafted a script that put female characters at the forefront. “Ramonda is a love letter that reflects and acknowledges what we women do everyday,” Bassett said. Her nomination challenges a long-held belief by many big names in Hollywood, including directors Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, that Marvel films are not real cinema. “They seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as I’ve known and loved them throughout my life, and that in the end, I don’t think they’re cinema,” Scorsese wrote in the New York Times in 2019, igniting backlash. Despite that kind of criticism, the first Black Panther won three Academy Awards after garnering seven Oscar nominations in 2019, including the first Best Picture nomination for a superhero movie.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-poised-approve-sending-abrams-tanks-ukraine/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – The United States, in a reversal, is poised to start a process that would eventually send dozens of M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, two US officials told Reuters on Tuesday, January 24. Such a decision by the United States would come just days after Washington argued against sending the Abrams, despite demands from Kyiv and public pressure from Berlin as it faced calls to send German-made Leopard battle tanks. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an announcement could come as early as Wednesday. A third source familiar with the matter said the US commitment could total about 30 Abrams tanks to be delivered over the coming months. The two officials said the Abrams would likely be procured through a fund known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which allows President Joe Biden’s administration to get weapons from industry rather than from existing US weapons stocks. One of the officials said it was possible the Biden administration could use the USAI process to buy the Abrams from allies who have them, refurbish them, then send them to Ukraine. The process can take months and even years. The United States and its allies failed during talks in Germany last week to convince Berlin to provide its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv as it tries to breath new momentum into its fight against Russian forces. Ukraine says heavily armored Western battle tanks would give its troops more mobility and protection ahead of a new Russian offensive that Kyiv expects in the near future. They could also help Ukraine retake some of the territory that has fallen to Russia. US officials had said that the Abrams was tough to maintain, hard to train Ukrainians to operate, and ran on jet fuel – making it a poor choice for this phase of the war. On Tuesday, the Pentagon declined to say whether Washington would provide tanks to Ukraine but reiterated the challenges the Abrams posed. “The M1 (Abrams) is a complex weapons system that is challenging to maintain… that was true yesterday, that is true today and will be true in the future,” Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters. “We continue to have discussions with Ukrainians and our allies and partners about what are the medium- and long-term defense requirements for Ukraine,” Ryder said. While eventually backtracking, Berlin had said it would only send the Leopard tanks to Ukraine if the United States agreed to send its own tanks. “The only reason the United States would send M1 tanks to Ukraine is to give Germany the political cover it requires to unlocking the Leopard tanks,” said Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The disclosure about the softening US position came the same day sources said that Germany would send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine to help fight Russia’s invasion and allow other countries such as Poland to do the same. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrat party had been holding back, wary of moves that could cause Moscow to escalate further. A source familiar with the matter said the coming U.S. decision was part of conversations with the Germans about their reluctance to provide tanks and to demonstrate that the U.S. commitment was significant. “The United States was willing to make a significant commitment to assist them in making theirs,” the source said. “The tanks are an important capability and if it took U.S. leadership then that’s what we were willing to do.” – Rappler.com"

Three sources familiar with the matter said News Corp was in talks to sell its stake in Move to CoStar for about $3 billion. Several top shareholders had publicly said they opposed the proposed Fox-News Corp combination, and on Tuesday, News Corp said in a statement that it was “not optimal for shareholders of News Corp and Fox at this time.” The deal would have recombined the media empire Murdoch split nearly a decade ago. News Corp confirmed the talks to sell Move to CoStar after Reuters reported it on Tuesday, adding that there is no guarantee the discussions will lead to a transaction. A spokesperson for CoStar said the company “continuously evaluates M&A opportunities across a broad range of companies to maximize shareholder value” and does not comment on “market rumors or speculation.” No offer was exchanged between News Corp and Fox before merger deliberations were abandoned, according to sources familiar with the process, who said pushback from News Corp shareholders played a role in those plans being scrapped. A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant that Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders, people familiar with the matter said. While Fox’s stock is down 5%, News Corp shares are up 25% since the talks between the two companies were first announced on October 14. News Corp currently has a market capitalization of about $11 billion, while Fox is valued at a shade over $17 billion. Murdoch proposed reuniting his media empire last fall, arguing that together the publishing and entertainment companies he split apart in 2013 would give the combined company greater scale in news, live sports, and information, sources said. Several people close to the Murdochs viewed the attempt to combine the media companies as driven by the 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan Murdoch, a notion the company described as “absurd” in November. Some of News Corp’s larger shareholders, including Independent Franchise Partners and T. Rowe Price, balked at the idea. Rupert Murdoch and his family trust control about 40% of News Corp and Fox. Had a deal been reached, they would have abstained from voting their shares when each company sought shareholder approval for the merger, because of the potential conflict of interest. This made securing the backing of other major shareholders a prerequisite to the deal going through. Activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which was among the first to say that the proposed reunion would likely undervalue News Corp, on Tuesday applauded the decision to not move forward. “This is the right decision,” Irenic’s chief investment officer Adam Katz said. “Looking ahead, News Corp has an opportunity to create substantial value for its owners.” News Corp agreed to buy Move in 2014 for $950 million to diversify its digital real estate business which, at the time, was primarily in Australia. Since then, News Corp investors had been calling on the company to spin off its digital real estate assets. Irenic also publicly urged News Corp to sell its Dow Jones media properties. On a slide-deck presentation in November, Irenic estimated News Corp’s 80% stake in Move was worth $1.4 billion on $2.47 per share. In a letter to News Corp employees on Tuesday, News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson said, “In my note to you in October, I said the Special Committee assessment would have no impact on our current operations; that was indeed the case, and remains so following today’s announcement.” – Rappler.com"

Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir toured the Al Aqsa mosque compound, which Jews revere as the Temple Mount, under heavy security this month. The visit angered the Palestinians and caused an outcry among Arab states. The compound is Islam’s third holiest site after Mecca and Medina, and Judaism’s most sacred site. Abdullah told Netanyahu, who took office last month, that Israel should respect the “historic and legal status quo in the Holy Aqsa mosque and not violate it,” the royal court said.

Jerusalem is a particularly sensitive issue for Jordan’s Hashemite royal family as it is the custodian of Muslim and Christian holy sites in the eastern part of the city.

It goes to the owner of Qpax,” Leonen said, referring to Qpax Traffic Systems, with whom various local government units (LGUs) in Metro Manila have existing partnerships or deals for traffic enforcement solutions. Through the NCAP, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and some LGUs in the country’s capital, aim to enforce traffic rules using traffic management technology. This includes advanced camera systems operated by computer vision, a field of artificial intelligence. “I don’t know what the figures now are for an investment of P50 million at most. And cost of how much? So this is a wealth transfer. A wealth transfer of a jeepney driver who has to meet a boundary, and therefore panics every day, and therefore waits until the traffic enforcer waives them,” Leonen said. “And when they are waived, it’s still the red light. And they are caught then they will have to go and experience the same thing that a justice of the Supreme Court experiences, except they are not justices, correct? So this is a wealth transfer, correct?” he said, adding that public utility vehicles like jeepneys and tricycles are the ones that use roads heavily. Leonen was referring to the penalties being collected from the supposed violators of the NCAP. During the oral arguments, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, who represents the government, particularly the MMDA and the Land Transportation Office (LTO), said the money being collected goes to a special trust fund. Portions of the collections go to the LGU and the service provider to fund the NCAP. He also pointed out that the use of technology in enforcing traffic rules could be discriminatory and that an “audit of algorithms” and biases of systems might be necessary as these could adversely affect motorists and drivers on the road. It is wrong to assume that just because a system is computerized, it is impartial, Leonen pointed out. The SC issued a temporary restraining order in August 2022, halting the implementation of the policy. The order stemmed from the petitions filed before the High Court, assailing the NCAP’s constitutionality. Leonen, during his interpellation, also noted that there are also other ways to prevent corruption using technology in the event the NCAP was declared unconstitutional. The senior associate justice said among the possible solutions could be turning the cameras from the motorists to the law enforcers. “If law enforcers had body cams they were mandated by ordinance, by MMDA, or by law to wear body cams and not to put them off at any time that they are on duty, otherwise, they will have committed a crime. We would focus on who it is that is committing corruption, rather than burdening our poor taxi drivers who ply our routes every day, go through traffic every day,” he explained. Leonen added: “In other words, what I’m saying is, that’s not a legal argument but I’m just saying there are other approaches where if we declare this as unconstitutional, they can use technology in order to also prevent the bad.” The continuation of the oral arguments was held more than a month since the first one was held on December 6, 2022. Leonen asked one of the petitioners, lawyer Juman Paa, if he thought he was “profiled” by the NCAP system. The senior associate justice proceeded in narrating how he was profiled in every airport he went to when he traveled overseas right after the 9/11 incident. “In the United States, the use of technology is now being challenged because it racially profiles. Based on crimes that are reported, when you passed on that data of earlier offenses being committed by those people of color, rather than those without color. And later on, what comes out of the black box is really that kind of bias,” Leonen said. During his interpellation of lawyer Carlo Lopez Austria, representative of the Quezon City local government, Leonen also asked about the system’s bias. The senior associate justice asked if the LGU assumed that because the NCAP’s system is computerized, “it is impartial.” Austria responded: “I believe that was the sentiment, your honor.” Leonen then said the LGU’s assumption was wrong because the system’s judgment will be based on the information provided to the system itself. “[It is] completely wrong even if you look at all the literature…. It depends on the information already inside, put in by the contractor, the basis for distinguishing a number 1, from a number 2, whether you take the plate number first, or the conduction sticker, correct?” Comparing the NCAP policy to the traditional traffic system that uses the “human factor,” Leonen said even the technology can be “biased.” “Even technology can be biased. Even the algorithm can be biased. So what do we have now? So we have the camera seeing, instead of a police seeing, the violation. We have the computer researching on who it is, rather than a police reporting to the LTO and looking for it, correct?” During the oral arguments, other justices also raised various points on the contested traffic policy. Associate Justice Japar Dimaampao raised questions about data privacy, particularly which entity will handle the data. Guevarra clarified that only the LTO has access to the data. The question whether the penalties under NCAP and ordinances related to it are penal in nature was also raised. Guevarra, in defense, said the penalties are only civil and/or administrative in nature. Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, at the end of the second round of oral arguments, said the parties involved are required to submit their respective memoranda within 30 days, non-extendible, starting Tuesday. During the interpellation, Chief Justice Gesmundo asked about the special provision authorizing Qpax to allocate certain portions of their share to certain local government officials in Quezon City. Austria, the LGU’s representative, said the special funds go to local projects. “We envisaged scenarios in which the revenue generated will be in excess…So part of their accountability, they should put it back into the community, your honor,” Austria explained. Austria added that the private operator decides on the special projects, while the LGU submits a list of potential projects. But it was later clarified that the local officials are the ones who would suggest the projects. At least among the LGU respondents in the petition, only Quezon City has the said special provision. Guevarra also explained that all the money collected from the program is considered public funds, which are also subjected to audit by the Commission on Audit (COA). Later in the oral arguments, Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa also asked about the sharing scheme between the private operator and the LGUs. Lawyer Veronica Lladoc, Manila LGU’s representative, said 65% of the collected funds go to Qpax, while the remaining go to the LGU. Meanwhile, 60% of the funds go to Qpax in Quezon City. This means the majority of the collected funds from the program could be used in the special projects favored by local officials. The project has gained a minimum P300 million revenue in Manila alone. Qpax’s chief executive officer is a certain Manolo Steven Ona, based on various records. The SC justices also raised questions on why the LGUs had tapped the same private operator. Chief Justice Gesmundo asked the Quezon City LGU representative if they partnered with Qpax because of the original proponent rule. Austria responded yes. However, representatives of Manila, Parañaque, and Muntinlupa said they did not enter into an agreement because of that rule. Parañaque and Muntinlupa LGUs said QPax is the “only proponent.” During the interpellation, lawyer Genesi Santiago, Muntinlupa’s representative, argued that the partnership is not covered by the procurement rules. Gesmundo, however, was of a different opinion. “Why? Why not? It’s a BOT (build-operate-transfer) in effect. It’s a JV (joint venture), in fact. And under the procurement law, JV should be following specific regulations and requirements,” Gesmundo said. – Rappler.com"

Chinese travellers no longer need to quarantine on return home and holiday bookings have surged from what was the world’s largest outbound travel market in 2019. “After three years I got to visit Manila again from China. It feels great, so many happy places,” said Anthony Lee, a 38-year-old Chinese businessman who was among about 200 passengers who arrived on the Xiamen Airlines flight to Manila, the first since 2020. China was the Philippines’ second-largest tourism market, with 1.7 million visitors in 2019, government data showed. Only 39,627 people from China visited last year, when the Philippines started relaxing its restrictions. “I have not gone to any countries. I am very happy now,” said Atsushih Amemye, 28, after he passed through immigration. The once $255 billion annual global spending by Chinese tourists ground to a virtual halt during the pandemic and left a hole in the Asian market. The Philippines, known for its powdery white sand beaches and lush marine life, is targeting 4.8 million foreign tourists this year, after 2.6 million in 2022. “We anticipate even more Chinese tourists to arrive, which will greatly help us in our effort to transform and recover the tourism industry,” Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco told reporters. “Our intention is not only to regain our pre-pandemic numbers but to exceed it.” – Rappler.com"

The PBA and its partner is set to launch the Bakbakan, or “battle” in Filipino around March, testing the waters first with the inaugural Mobile Legends: Bang Bang tourney. According to Dark League CEO AC Valdenor, they are set to introduce Call of Duty Mobile, DOTA 2, and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds in the future. Dark League is a partnership among Valdenor, and PBA governors Alfrancis Chua of Barangay Ginebra and Bobby Rosales of Terrafirma. “This could influence people that there are [potential] careers in esports. There is something for you at a professional level,” said Valdenor during the introductory press conference at their office in Libis, Quezon City on Tuesday, January 24. “It is a sport of something new that we can actually use, that we can create a community in esports, and we are very thankful to the PBA,” he added. All 12 PBA teams shall be represented in the opening tourney, set to be held every Monday for five weeks, which shall be livestreamed on the league’s official accounts. The top four teams after the single-round robin eliminations shall qualify to the best-of-five semifinals, targeted to be held either at the Araneta Coliseum or the Mall of Asia Arena.

https://www.rappler.com/business/china-offers-sri-lanka-debt-moratorium-january-2023/,[],"The Export-Import Bank of China has offered Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on its debt and said it will support the country’s efforts to secure a $2.9-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. Regional rivals China and India are the biggest bilateral lenders to Sri Lanka, a country of 22 million people that is facing its worst economic crisis in seven decades. India wrote to the IMF earlier this month, saying it would commit to supporting Sri Lanka with financing and debt relief, but the island nation also needs the backing of China in order to reach a final agreement with the global lender. However, China’s letter on Thursday, January 19, sent to the finance ministry, may not be enough for Sri Lanka to immediately gain the IMF’s approval for the critical loan, a Sri Lankan source with knowledge of the matter said. According to the letter, China EximBank said it was going to provide “an extension on the debt service due in 2022 and 2023 as an immediate contingency measure” based on Sri Lanka’s request. At the end of 2020, China EximBank had loaned Sri Lanka $2.83 billion which is 3.5% of the island’s debt, according to an IMF report released in March last year. “You will not have to repay the principal and interest due of the bank’s loans during the abovementioned period,” the letter said. “Meanwhile, we would like to expedite the negotiation process with your side regarding medium and long-term debt treatment in this window period.” Sri Lanka owed Chinese lenders $7.4 billion, or nearly a fifth of its public external debt, by the end of last year, calculations by the China Africa Research Initiative showed. “The bank will support Sri Lanka in your application for the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to help relieve the liquidity strain,” China’s letter said. One Sri Lankan source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the confidential discussions, said the island nation had hoped for a clear assurance from Beijing on the lines of what India provided to the IMF. “China was expected to do more,” the source said, “This is much less than what is required and expected of them.” In a letter directly addressed to the IMF, India said last week that the financing or debt relief provided by Export-Import Bank of India would be consistent with restoring debt sustainability under the IMF-supported program. Another government source with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters that Sri Lanka would likely share China’s letter with the IMF and seek their opinion on its contents. “That may be the best way to understand if this is in line with the IMF’s expectations or stronger assurances are needed,” the source said. It is unclear what debt relief major lenders such as China – the world’s largest bilateral lender – and India are willing to make further down the line. Western countries such as the United States and multilateral lenders are pressing Beijing to offer debt relief to emerging economies in distress, and have criticized Beijing for slow progress. However, news from Zambia on Monday, January 23, suggests China could be playing a more proactive role. Speaking in the capital Lusaka, the head of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva said the lender had reached an understanding in principle with China about plans to restructure Zambia’s debt. China will de facto accept NPV (net present value) reduction on the basis of significant stretching of the maturities and reduction of interest, Georgieva said. Sri Lanka’s foreign and finance ministries and China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. Sri Lanka’s central bank chief P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said on Tuesday, January 24, that the country hoped for assurances from China and Japan, another major bilateral lender, soon and complete debt restructuring in six months. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/bureau-corrections-zulueta-no-show-percy-lapid-death-probe-january-2023/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) superintendent Ricardo Zulueta was still a no-show during the continuation of the preliminary investigation into the death of hard-hitting broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa. “However, there is no show for respondents Zulueta and Dimaculangan brothers. Right now, we just received the motion for reconsideration the order issued by the panel denying motion for inhibition of DG (Director General) Bantag,” Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Charlie Guhit told reporters on Tuesday, January 24, detailing which respondents attended the preliminary probe. Zulueta and suspended BuCor chief Gerald Bantag both face complaints for the killings of Lapid and Jun Villamor. The latter was believed to be the middleman who contacted people to kill the broadcaster. Meanwhile, Dimaculangan brothers, Israel and Edmon, are among the named suspects in Lapid’s slay. Zulueta and other respondents have yet to appear before the Department of Justice (DOJ), have also yet to submit their counter-affidavits as response to the complaints thrown at them. Bantag has also yet to submit his counter-affidavit, but he has appeared once before the justice department. Meanwhile, his legal counsels regularly attend the probe. According to Guhit the complaints will not yet be submitted for resolution because the hearing is still ongoing. “Since the hearing is continuing and the PI (preliminary investigation) is still open they can always attend the hearing and submit their counter-affidavit. Now, when the PI is already closed, submitted for resolution, then that’s the time I can say that they waived their right to submit their counter-affidavit,” the senior assistant state prosecutor explained. “I can only say that under the rules no submission of a counter-affidavit, we can take it as if they are submitting the case for resolution.” After months of being under the radar, Zulueta finally appeared before the public in December last year. He was implicated in the Lapid and Villamor cases as early as November 2022. Through his lawyer, Zulueta said he was not in hiding and is ready to rebut allegations against him. Roy Mabasa, Lapid’s younger brother, said the worst-case scenario they expected was Bantag will file another motion in relation to the complaints he faces: “‘Yon ‘yong mga worst scenario na ine-expect natin, motions after motions. But at the end of the day, kailangan talagang sumunod siya sa proseso.” (That’s the worst-case scenario we expect, motions after motions. But at the end of the day, he really needs to follow the process.) On December 5, during the earlier days of preliminary investigation into the Lapid case, Bantag filed a motion for inhibition, which asked the prosecutors to distance from the case. He filed the motion instead of filing his counter-affidavit. Last week, on January 19, the DOJ denied Bantag’s motion. During the preliminary investigation on Tuesday, Bantag’s camp filed a motion for reconsideration in relation to the complaints. “Yes, we filed a motion for reconsideration. First, because that is in accordance with the rules, and second on the ground that we filed a similar case – a murder case before the Ombudsman that is against the honorable secretary and the other correspondents,” Rocky Thomas Balisong, one of Bantag’s counsels said. Meanwhile, the status hearing for the complaints against Bantag and his companions is scheduled on January 31, at 2 pm. Bantag’s motion was denied on Tuesday, January 31, ,Balisong said. “The motion for reconsideration was denied. It was set for hearing again on February 8. So, let’s see what will happen on February 8,” the lawyer said. – Rappler.com"

The third seed dominated the opening set after breaking a nervy Lehecka early on but was pushed hard after that against the 21-year-old who has enjoyed a breakout tournament. Lehecka, who had never won a Grand Slam match before arriving in Melbourne, used his powerful baseline game to stay with Tsitsipas in the second set but the Greek raised his game to ease through the tiebreak. Tsitsipas was forced to save three successive break points at 3-3 in the third set as Lehecka threatened to extend the Rod Laver Arena clash. The 24-year-old then pounced with Lehecka serving at 4-5, reaching match point with a searing backhand pass and wrapping up victory as his opponent netted a backhand. Tsitsipas will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the semifinal. “I can say it was a fair dinkum type of performance,” Tsitsipas said on court. “It felt different this time from the other time we played but I found a solution. “I had to deal with groundstrokes that were coming at me heavy and deep. I put my heart out there.” Lehecka, who enjoyed impressive wins against seeded players Borna Coric, Cameron Norrie, and Felix Auger-Aliassime during his run, will rue not taking any of eight break points. His big chance came when Tsitsipas double-faulted to go 0-40 down at 3-3 in the third set, but he was unable to convert any of them and after that the writing was on the wall. Tsitsipas loves the Melbourne fortnight and has looked in top form this year, winning four of his five matches so far in straight sets with only Jannick Sinner able to extend him in a five-set clash in the last 16. He began aggressively against Lehecka and broke the Czech’s first service game at the fourth time of asking, hoisting a lob on the stretch that proved too awkward for his opponent. It gave him a flying start but after he took the opener there was little between the players as Lehecka, whose hard-hitting game looks to be modelled on Czech former player Tomas Berdych, pushed Tsitsipas to the limit. He got to within two points of taking the second set but Tsitsipas was too good in the tiebreak. Despite defeat, Lehecka’s run here marks him out a player capable of flying up the rankings from his current 71. “When I think about it, of course, I mean, if somebody has told me before the tournament that I would play quarters here, I would take it for sure,” he told reporters. “Now it’s bittersweet because I can’t still enjoy the success. Now it’s hard for me to say how happy I am about it.” – Rappler.com"

Ancajas, who threw caution to the wind and challenged Fernandez again only to suffer another unanimous decision loss last October, will spend the next two months training at the Top Rank Gym for his first fight as a bantamweight either in March or April. MP (Manny Pacquiao) Promotions president Sean Gibbons is looking for a suitable opponent for Ancajas, who is already in fine condition as he worked out consistently at Survival Camp in Magallanes, Cavite. An impressive win could earn Ancajas another title crack at the 118-pound division, where he is ranked No. 5 by the IBF and No. 10 by the World Boxing Association without even throwing a punch. In Las Vegas, Ancajas and Jimenez will be staying in a spacious house provided by Gibbons for MP Promotion fighters, including former world champion Marlon Tapales and unbeaten prospect Jade Bornea. Ancajas was supposed to tangle with Thai Songsaeng Phoyaem on February 12 at the Imus Sports Complex, but Gibbons decided it would be better for him to return to the United States.

The marsican bear, which had been named Juan Carrito, was killed after it was hit by an Opel Corsa car on a mountain road near the town of Castel di Sangro in central Italy on Monday evening. “There are no words to express our sadness at what has happened,” the national park of Abruzzo, Lazio, and Molise said on Instagram. “Juan Carrito was a problematic bear but in the park we did everything… to give him a chance and allow him to remain free,” it added. The 150-kg bear was captured last year and taken to a more remote region after his bakery break-in but the four-year-old liked to return to his old haunts in search of food. Before the accident, he had been spotted over the weekend in a ski resort, Italy’s Rai news reported. There are believed to be only around 50 marsican bears left in Italy. The bear’s name came in part from the village of Carrito in Abruzzo where local media reported he was first spotted crossing a road.

Modi’s government has dismissed the documentary, which questioned his leadership during deadly riots in his home state of Gujarat in 2002, as “propaganda”, blocked its airing and also barred sharing of any clips via social media in India. Modi was chief minister of the western state during the violence that killed more than 2,000 people, most of them Muslims. The students’ union of New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, long seen as a bastion of left-wing politics, said on Twitter it would screen the documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” at a cafeteria at 9 p.m. (1530 GMT). On its website, the university administration said it had not given permission for the showing. “This is to emphasize that such an unauthorized activity may disturb peace and harmony of the university campus,” it added. “The concerned students/individuals are firmly advised to cancel the proposed program immediately, failing which a strict disciplinary action may be initiated as per the university rules.” On Twitter, the union president, Aishe Ghosh, had asked students to attend the screening of the documentary, describing it as having been “‘banned’ by an ‘elected government’ of the largest ‘democracy'”. Asked by Reuters if the union planned to go ahead with the screening, Ghosh responded, “Yes, we are.” She declined to comment on the university’s threat of disciplinary action, however. Police are closely watching the situation, said a Delhi police officer monitoring the area around JNU. But police in the capital declined to make any official comment. The documentary is also set to be screened at some campuses in the Communist-ruled southern state of Kerala. India’s home ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the government’s plans if the film is shown at JNU and in Kerala. The 2002 Gujarat violence erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire, killing 59. Crowds later rampaged through Muslim neighborhoods. In 2017, 11 men were jailed for life for setting the train ablaze. Modi has denied accusations that he did not do enough to stop the riots and was exonerated in 2012 following an inquiry overseen by the Supreme Court. Another petition questioning his exoneration was dismissed last year. Last week, the BBC said the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a “wide range” of voices and opinions, including responses from people in Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the threat of disciplinary action. – Rappler.com"

American import Gaige Prim propelled Ulsan to the victory as he tallied a huge double-double of 24 points and 10 rebounds. Ulsan’s Filipino reinforcement Abarrientos, meanwhile, was held to just 6 points, 4 assists, 3 steals, and 2 rebounds in a little less than 18 minutes of play.

Former NBA journeyman Dante Cunningham scored a team-best 16 points for Changwon, while Abarrientos’ Filipino counterpart Gutang went scoreless in close to six minutes of action. Ulsan inched closer to chasing Changwon at the second spot as the former improved its record to 20-14, while the latter fell to 20-13.

This reality is placed front and center in a Move PH webinar joined by embattled journalist Frank Cimatu, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) chairman Jonathan de Santos, and Senator Risa Hontiveros, with Rappler reporter Lian Buan acting as moderator. The Baguio City-based Cimatu, who was convicted of cyber libel by a trial court in December 2022, lamented the inconvenience that comes with the court verdict: expensive, multiple travels to Metro Manila to appeal the case, and the continued harassment on social media. “I have friends who defended me who until now are still being attacked by trolls. It’s not only a lonely battle, your friends are also affected,” he said. “A foe told me what happened to me is a lesson because we journalists always use politicians as a punching bag. Now, I am the punching bag,” Cimatu added. De Santos, whose organization assists media colleagues in legal distress, said the jail sentence that comes with libel laws causes extreme stress to journalists, who are sometimes unaware of how to navigate these cases. “There have been times when colleagues receive demand letters. They didn’t know they had to respond within a certain number of days, so the case prospered,” he shared. “We’ve seen so many cases where their expression online is taken as a sign of a crime,” he added. “That’s an extra hassle, and most of the time, you should be protected because it’s your expression, free speech.” Hontiveros, author of a bill that seeks to decriminalize libel, said that her advocacy would help preserve the country’s democratic rights. If her measure passes into law, those found guilty of libel will still face repercussions, but in the form of monetary penalty, which is a punishment that she hopes would be a bargaining chip for lawmakers who are reluctant to support her bill. “You in the media are called the fourth estate, so you are expected to check on us, correct our wrongdoings, fact-check us. We’ve often been told we should not be onion-skinned, and that’s true,” she said. “As a politician, I am also a [Filipino] citizen. I hold on to the press freedom that you exercise and protect,” Hontiveros added. While calls to decriminalize libel have endured for years, the leadership in the 19th Congress has yet to show enthusiasm towards proposals on the matter. It is not listed among the legislative priorities of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Globally, around 160 countries still criminalize libel. – Rappler.com * All quotes in Filipino were translated into English and some were shortened for brevity."

The town festival marked a triumphant return to normalcy for Linamon, which had been left in a state of economic and social stagnation, feeling like a ghost town due to the pandemic. The Hudyaka sa Lubi brought back joy and celebration to the town, which is known for its thriving coconut industry and delicious buko pies (coconut pies). The festival, which featured traditional dances and colorful costumes, drew thousands of visitors from neighboring Iligan City and towns. It also gave many poor town residents, whose livelihoods had been hurt by the strict health rules imposed due to the pandemic, the opportunity to earn even for just one day. “I’m happy because we can sell more ice cream today,” said vendor Jessel Mae Ladion, a working criminology student. Another vendor, Giovanni Darog, was in high spirits after he sold P3,000 worth of bottled mineral water during the festival. He said he had never earned that much by selling bottled water since the effects of COVID-19 were felt in Lanao del Norte. Linamon’s beach resorts, where he sells mineral water, had been closed during the first two years of the pandemic, and when they reopened, sales remained sluggish as fewer people visited the town’s beaches. Ladion said Monday’s festival brought back memories of pre-pandemic Linamon, which she said was a busy and vibrant town. “We hope that the old times are back for good so that we can increase our earnings. We have not been selling much since the schools were shut down because of this virus. There were no people on the roads,” she said. Despite the local government’s scarce resources, Mayor Macapil said the town government spent a minimal amount on the festival – enough to bring people to the streets and watch the parade. Eight of Linamon’s villages sent groups to take part in the Hudyaka sa Lubi’s group dance, street dancing contests, and festival queen contest, as they had done during prior to the pandemic. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-activists-victims-file-criminal-complaint-germany-alleged-atrocities/,[],"BANGKOK, Thailand – Myanmar activists and 16 alleged victims of abuse have filed a criminal complaint in Germany, accusing top generals of instigating genocide against Rohingya Muslims and other atrocities since a military coup two years ago. The filing is the latest in a series of international legal efforts to try to hold the Myanmar military accountable for alleged atrocities against the country’s Rohingya minority and democracy supporters and civilians opposed to the coup. Fortify Rights, a human rights group backing the complaint, said Germany was picked because of its recognition of the principle of “universal jurisdiction”, which holds that a national court can try individuals accused of serious international crimes. “The complaint provides new evidence proving that the Myanmar military systematically killed, raped, tortured, imprisoned, disappeared, persecuted, and committed other acts that amount to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes,” Matthew Smith, chief executive officer and co-founder at Fortify Rights, told a news conference in Bangkok. A spokesman for Myanmar’s military government did not answer a call seeking comment on the complaint filed in Germany. The military has in the past denied rights abuses. Fortify Rights hopes German authorities will take up the complaint and launch an investigation. A German court last year jailed a Syrian ex-intelligence officer for life for murder, rape and crimes against humanity, marking the first conviction for state-backed torture committed during Syria’s civil war. The German embassy in Myanmar could not immediately be reached for comment. The 16 individual complainants in the Myanmar filing include ethnic Rohingya and others who survived or witnessed crimes in Myanmar since the coup, Fortify Rights said. The International Court of Justice has been hearing allegations that Myanmar committed genocide in a case brought by Gambia after hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape a Myanmar military offensive launched in August 2017. Last year, another civil society group, the Myanmar Accountability Project, said Turkish authorities had initiated a preliminary investigation after it filed a case against members of the Myanmar junta over alleged atrocities since the coup. In the case of the Rohingya, Myanmar authorities have previously said security forces were carrying out legitimate operations against militants who attacked police posts. The junta has also denied the military had carried out atrocities since the coup, disputing casualty figures given by activists and terming opponents “terrorists”. Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the US-based Global Justice Center, welcomed the filing of the complaint in Germany saying that, along with other accountability processes, it could help “pierce the total impunity the military has been afforded for far too long”. The military ruled the former British colony with an iron fist for years before a decade of tentative reform from 2011, during which Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi led a civilian government. Suu Kyi has been in detention since her government was overthrown in 2021.

Abalos said in Cotabato City on Monday, January 23, that 10 of the PNP’s highest-ranking officials have not tendered their courtesy resignations. “Some are retiring,” said Abalos, who visited the city for the 4th founding anniversary celebration of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). He did not elaborate but said that he was thankful that the majority of the PNP generals and colonels cooperated to make it easier for the Marcos administration to purge the police organization. In early January, Abalos called on police generals and colonels to submit their courtesy resignation as part of efforts to purge the PNP of erring cops, especially those with drug links. In the BARMM alone, two generals, including PNP regional director Brigadier General John Guyguyon, and 13 colonels tendered their courtesy resignation days after Abalos made the call. Last week, PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said more than 97% of the country’s 953 generals and colonels heeded Abalos’ call. He said two generals and five colonels who have not submitted their resignation letters would retire before the 2nd quarter. The PNP said all those who volunteered to resign would be assessed by a five-person committee led by Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong, a retired police general. The committee’s recommendations would then be reviewed by the National Police Commission (Napolcom), and submitted to President Marcos Jr. who may accept or reject the resignations. In Cotabato, Abalos called on Bangsamoro officials to help the Marcos administration crack down on illegal drugs and to ensure that prison facilities in the region are drug-free. “You must give them a drug-free environment. It’s about correction. It’s about rehabilitation. If drugs are sneaked into these facilities, then our campaign is useless,” he said. Abalos also ordered the BARMM police to carry out the anti-drug campaign and expand its coverage to 63 villages in Cotabato province that are now part of the Bangsamoro’s political territory. While Cotabato province is part of Soccsksargen, 63 of its villages voted to become BARMM’s special geographic areas, a setup that has resulted in confusion and overlapping of functions between the PNP-Soccksargen and PNP-BARMM. Abalos said it was already agreed that the 63 special geographic areas in Cotabato province would be the responsibility of PNP-BARMM. – Rappler.com"

Ranara’s burned remains were found in the desert, Kuwait media reported on Sunday, January 22. Migrant Workers Secretary Susan “Toots” Ople told DZBB on Tuesday said that the suspect, the 17-year-old son of Ranara’s employer, was under Kuwaiti police custody. “Kasama ng lahat ng migrante, nakikiisa kami sa panawagan ng kanyang pamilya para sa katarungan (Together with all migrants, we are one in the Ranara family’s call for justice),” Migrante said. The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) on Monday, January 23, condemned the “heinous” crime, and urged the Kuwaiti government to work on the early resolution of the case to bring the perpetrators to justice. Ople also visited Ranara’s family to condole with them and offer all necessary support they needed. In the DZBB interview, Ople said that Ranara had complained about her employer’s son. “‘Yun daw ‘yung malupit sa kanya. In fact, may isang time daw na parang binantaan daw ‘yung buhay niya (He was the one who was cruel to her. In fact, there was a time when he appeared to threaten her life),” said Ople. As of Tuesday, the DMW is still awaiting the official police report. The department said it is in close coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Kuwaiti authorities. The migrant workers chief said the Philippine government was looking into how the suspect’s being a minor will affect his liability. Migrante said that Ranara’s death and her addition to the “thousands” of domestic workers who have been abused in Kuwait is “proof” of how modern slavery thrives in the country. “Sa nakalipas na mahigit anim na taon, hindi matigil ang karumal-dumal na pagpaslang sa ating mga kababayan. Walang nagbabago sa kanilang kalagayan kaya’t nasundan ng pagpatay kay Ranara ang sinapit ng mga pinaslang na domestic workers na sina Joanna Demafelis, Jeanelyn Villavende at marami pang iba,” said Migrante. (In over the past six years, the heinous killings of our countrymen have not stopped. Their situation has not changed, which is why Ranara’s killing has followed those of other slain domestic workers such as Joanna Demafelis, Jeanelyn Villavende, and more.) According to Migrante, there are some 400 abused OFWs who stay in Philippine government facilities in Kuwait, unable to go home. Migrante said the Philippine government’s labor export program contributes to giving space for such abuses to happen. “Sa prayoritisasyon sa pagkuha ng maksimum na ganansya sa remittances, pagpapanatiling competitive sa mga OFW, at dereguladong patakaran sa deployment, integrado sa patakarang serbisyo ng gobyerno na tiisin ng mga domestic workers ang kanilang kalagayan, muli itong ipagkasundo kahit sa mga nang-aabusong amo at ipasa ang obligasyong serbisyo sa OFW o recruitment agency sa panahon ng mahigpit na pangangailangan,” the rights group said. (With the prioritization of obtaining the maximum benefit in remittances, keeping OFWs competitive, and a deregulated deployment policy, it is integrated in the government’s service policy for domestic workers to endure their situation, tolerate even abusive employers, and pass on service obligations to the OFW or their recruitment agency in times of dire need.) The rights group called for an end to the labor export program, and the creation of more livelihood in the Philippines. “Sa halip na ibenta ang mga manggagawa sa mga banyaga, kagyat na balangkasin dapat ng gobyerno ang sustenableng programa ng reintegrasyon sa mga OFW. Sa higpit ng pangangailangan sa guro, health at social workers, at iba pang propesyunal sa loob ng ating bayan, ang kailangan lamang gawin ng gobyerno ay likhain ang nakabubuhay na trabaho mula sa sarili nating bansa,” Migrante said. (Instead of selling our workers to foreigners, the government should develop a sustainable reintegration program for OFWs. With the urgent need for teachers, health and social workers, and other professionals here in our country, the government only needs to create jobs at home.) On Tuesday, Senator Risa Hontiveros also expressed sympathies for Ranara’s family, and condemned incidents of OFW abuse in the Middle East. “Nananawagan din ako sa DMW at sa iba pang mga ahensya ng gobyerno na tutukang mabuti ang kalagayan ng ating mga kababayan sa Kuwait habang sila’y nagtatrabaho pa doon, at lalo na kung, at huwag na sana pong madagdagan, may sinapit na ganitong… napakapait na kapalaran sa Kuwait po kung saan marami na palang naiulat ng kaso ng pang-aabuso at pang-mamaltrato,” she said. (I am also calling on the DMW and other government agencies to focus on the situation of our countrymen in Kuwait while they still work there, especially [so that we can avoid] more incidents of OFWs facing this tragic fate in Kuwait, where there are many cases of abuse and maltreatment.) Hontiveros said that it was “not enough” to just call for justice for Ranara. “Ang tunay na hustisya ay kakabit ng ating masigasig na pagsiguro na mapo-protektahan ang ating mga kababayang nagtatrabaho malayo sa ating Inang Bayan (True justice comes with a zealous effort to make sure that our countrymen working away from the Motherland will be protected),” she said.

Dr. Thomas Neil Pascual, a former Balik Scientist and now an S&T Fellow assigned at the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI), is making strides in contributing to the establishment of the first Nuclear Medicine Center of PNRI. The Center hopes to help in providing affordable diagnosis and treatment for cancer. “I’ve always believed in the brilliance of our Filipino scientists and it is only fitting that we create opportunities and encourage them to work in the country,” said DOST Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. “By encouraging our researchers, scientists, and engineers to work in the government, we are not only building a stronger workforce but also cultivating a rich scientific community dedicated to nation-building,” he added. The S&T Fellows Program aims to increase and strengthen the R&D human resource complement of the DOST. The S&T Fellows are expected to participate in the conceptualization, policy and funding development, and monitoring and evaluation of various R&D programs and projects. These initiatives would then generate more outputs with nationwide social and economic impact such as partnerships, people services, publications, patents, products, and policies. The program is at its second year of implementation offering competitive compensation and hopes to attract MS and PhD graduates. The call for applications is now open for 33 S&T Fellows, with the following qualifications: The DOST is looking for experts in the following fields of specialization: radio frequency and wireless communications systems, blockchain technology, data and food science, environmental science, computer engineering, nanotechnology, material science and engineering, virology, geochemistry, health technology assessment or economics, among others.

China staged war games near Taiwan last August, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Tsai wrote that Taiwan has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and provided masks and protective equipment to countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it “hopes to give the world a better Taiwan”. “Though we are still excluded from the World Health Organization, we are convinced that taking the lead in making positive contributions will drive a ‘virtuous circle’,” she added. Taiwan has complained repeatedly that its exclusion from the WHO, due to Chinese pressure, has hampered efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the WHO and China have denied that. Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island’s 23 million people can decide their future. – Rappler.com"

Boston was within two points, 97-95, following a Jayson Tatum 3-pointer with 6:20 to play, but the Magic went on a 10-0 run in the next 3:24 to pull away. It was Orlando’s third victory over Boston in four tries this season. It also ended Boston’s nine-game winning streak. Cole Anthony came off the bench to score 18 points for Orlando, which received a 15-point performance from Franz Wagner. Tatum, who missed Boston’s 106-104 victory at Toronto with a sore left wrist, and Jaylen Brown each scored 26 points for the Celtics, who committed 18 turnovers. The Celtics attempted 46 3-pointers and made 18 (39.1 percent). Boston played without center Robert Williams III (knee), guard Marcus Smart (ankle) and guard Malcolm Brogdon (personal reasons). Orlando’s Jonathan Isaac, the No. 6 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, returned to action after missing the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons due to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The injury occurred in 2020 against the Sacramento Kings during the NBA restart. Isaac had 10 points, three rebounds, two steals and one assist in 10 minutes. Orlando closed the first quarter on an 11-4 run and led 30-23 entering the second. Boston trailed 43-29 with 8:13 left in the first half but used a 16-1 spurt to take a 45-44 lead.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/philips-trio-reunite-isaiah-joins-brothers-michael-ben-dlsu-green-archers/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Another Phillips brother is headed to De La Salle University as Isaiah Phillips, the younger brother of Benjamin and older brother of Michael, joins the Green Archers for UAAP Season 86. The 22-year-old middle child of the trio is currently finishing his undergraduate degree at Miami University, where he is majoring in East Asian Studies with a minor in Japanese. Isaiah, who will have three years of UAAP eligibility, will then enroll for his master’s degree at La Salle, where he will be part of the Green Archers’ pool of talent to compete for Season 86 roster spots. “I graduate here from Miami University [in Ohio] in May. After [that], I’ll be flying over to the Philippines,” he told Rappler. Once he gets to Taft, he believes his first order of business is to “try out” for the Green Archers and prove to his coaches that he deserves a roster spot. “Alam ko na maraming magaling na players sa La Salle (I know there are a lot of good players at La Salle), so it won’t be easy, but I want to do my best to try and help La Salle win more games and to represent the La Salle community.” The 6-foot-8 Isaiah is a multi-sport athlete, having played varsity basketball and volleyball in high school while also participating in competitive boxing. He considers himself a “defense-first type of player.” “I feel like I can bring a lot of energy on the defensive end, and in the offensive end in the post, short mid-range jumpers are something I work a lot on and something I hope to improve for the tryout and hopefully I can showcase that.” The apparent “peacemaker” when Benjamin and Michael would butt heads as kids, Isaiah said that he can “run the floor, do the dirty work, dive for the loose balls, support the players, and just do what coaches ask me to do.” Isaiah is currently on an academic scholarship at Miami University, but has been playing 5-on-5 games and going to the boxing gym to condition himself for the UAAP. The absence of Michael Phillips due to a concussion proved to be a big blow as La Salle missed the Final Four bus in Season 85. Michael, though, is now “out of the woods,” according to his father Benjamin Sr. “It helped me realize my health was really important,” Michael said. “Everything is planned for God. Right now, I’m blessed, my headaches are a lot better. I’m having concussion therapy here in the States. I think the thing that’s been helping me is being with my family.” Michael, who after trimming weight in 2022 is now back to his natural body weight of 230 pounds, is already participating in 5-on-5 scrimmages and conditioning drills while he stays in Florida. He will fly back to Manila in February. “It’s really tricky,” he said of the rehab. “It’s based around rest, rest, and rest. That’s what my doctors here and in the Philippines have said.” “Luckily, I’m past that full-rest part. I’m doing some exercises, some hand-eye coordination things. Just taking it step by step.” While Michael eases back into action, Benjamin has dived head-first into a taxing schedule. The oldest of the siblings shared that he starts his days early in the morning to focus on work emails for the businesses he owns back home in the United States. That includes a workout-themed phone application and a men’s facial grooming enterprise. He then works on his thesis so that he can finish the final semester of his masteral studies before following his mother’s footsteps and attaining a doctorate in the years to come. After lunch, he joins the La Salle men’s volleyball team’s practices in preparation for their upcoming UAAP Season 85 campaign. In the afternoon, he joins the Green Archers’ training sessions, now under the direction of new head coach Topex Robinson. He is also in the process of writing his second book. His first novel – Lone Wolf Mentality: A Millennial Mindset – was published in 2019. “It’s pretty demanding,” he admitted, “but when you’re given so much opportunity here at La Salle, you want to maximize and give as much as you can to the school.” Ben, who earned more playing time and performed better on the court in his second season with La Salle compared to his first, believes cross-training between volleyball and basketball allows him to improve in each field. “It helps ease a lot of injuries. My jumping is a lot better in basketball because I know how to land because of volleyball. My timing is better in volleyball because of the things I’m doing in basketball,” he said. – Rappler.com"

Ang katotohanan: Lumang pahayag ni Tulfo na mula sa kanyang programang Raffy Tulfo in Action ang ginamit sa mapanlinlang na video. Sa kanyang naging pahayag noong Hunyo 2022, walang sinabi si Tulfo na sang-ayon siyang magkaroon na lamang ng alternatibong dalawang taong military service imbes na karagdagang dalawang taon sa senior high.

The Serbian remained on track for a 10th Melbourne Park title on Monday, January 23, with a fourth-round thrashing of Alex de Minaur despite the injury that he had previously said called into question whether he could continue in the tournament. In his English post-match press conference, the 35-year-old said he felt as good as he had since he sustained the injury in an Adelaide warm-up tournament, but in later comments to Serbian media he rounded on the doubters. “I leave the doubting to those people; let them doubt,” he said, according to the Tennis Majors website. “Only my injuries are questioned. When some other players are injured, then they are the victims, but when it is me, I am faking it. It is very interesting. I don’t feel that I need to prove anything to anyone.” Djokovic, who missed last year’s tournament after being kicked out of Australia because of his stance on COVID-19 vaccinations, battled an abdominal problem throughout his run to his ninth title in 2021. “I have got the MRI, ultrasound and everything else, both from two years ago and now,” he added. “Whether I will publish that in my documentary or on the social media depends on how I feel. Maybe I will do I it, maybe I won’t.” Djokovic could match Rafa Nadal’s record by winning a 22nd Grand Slam title, but has often complained that he is not held in the same regard as the injury-prone Spaniard and Roger Federer. “I am not really interested at this point what people are thinking and saying,” he said. “It is fun, it is interesting to see how the narrative surrounding me continues, narrative that is different compared to other players that have been going through a similar situation. “But I am used to it, and it just gives me extra strength and motivation. So I thank them for that.” Djokovic will play Russian Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, January 25. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-investigation-cough-syrup-deaths/,[],"The World Health Organization (WHO) is investigating whether there is any connection between manufacturers whose contaminated cough syrups it has linked to the deaths of more than 300 children in three countries, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Citing “unacceptable levels” of toxins in the products, the WHO is seeking more information about the specific raw materials used by six manufacturers in India and Indonesia to produce medicines linked to the recent deaths, as well as whether the companies obtained them from some of the same suppliers, the person said. The WHO has not named any suppliers. The WHO also is considering whether to advise families globally to reassess the use of cough syrups for children in general while questions over the safety of some of these products are unresolved, the person said. WHO experts are evaluating the evidence for whether, or when, such products are medically necessary for children, the person said. The deaths of children from acute kidney injury began in July 2022 in Gambia, followed by cases in Indonesia and Uzbekistan. The WHO has said the deaths are linked to over-the-counter cough syrups the children took for common illnesses and which contained a known toxin, either diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol. To date, the WHO has identified six drugmakers in India and Indonesia who produced the syrups. These manufacturers have either declined to comment on the investigation or denied using contaminated materials that contributed to any deaths. Reuters has no evidence of wrongdoing by the companies the WHO has named. “This is of the highest priority for us, to see no more child deaths from something that is so preventable,” WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said, without commenting further on the details of the organization’s work. The United Nations health agency said on Monday, January 23, it had widened its investigation into potential diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol contamination in cough syrups to four additional countries where the same products may have been on sale: Cambodia, the Philippines, East Timor, and Senegal. It called on other governments and the global pharmaceutical industry to launch urgent checks to root out substandard medicines and improve regulation. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that its members “are already doing what the WHO is calling for,” in line with national and international guidelines. The WHO is expected to comment further on the cough syrup situation during a news conference later on Tuesday, January 24. The WHO has already issued specific alerts for cough syrups made by two Indian manufacturers, Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Marion Biotech, in October 2022 and earlier this month. It said their syrups were linked to deaths in Gambia and Uzbekistan respectively, and the alerts asked people to stop using them. Maiden and Marion’s manufacturing plants have both been shuttered. Maiden is now seeking to reopen after the Indian government said in December that its testing had found no problems with Maiden’s products. Maiden has repeatedly told Reuters, including in December, that it did nothing wrong and Managing Director Naresh Kumar Goyal said on Tuesday he had no comment on WHO investigating possible connections between the companies under scrutiny. Marion’s office phone went unanswered on Tuesday and the company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Earlier this month, it told the government of Uttar Pradesh, where it is located near New Delhi, that it was being blamed for the deaths in Uzbekistan “to malign the image of India and the company”. The WHO, working with Indonesia’s drugs regulator, also issued an alert in October about cough syrups made by four Indonesian manufacturers and sold domestically. The manufacturers are: PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Universal Pharmaceutical, PT Konimex, PT AFI Farma. PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Konimex and PT AFI Farma did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday about the WHO investigating connections between the deaths in the three countries. PT Universal Pharmaceutical Industries’ lawyer, Hermansyah Hutagalung, said it had pulled from the market all cough syrups deemed dangerous. “Chase the suppliers, they’re the real criminals,” Hutagalung added. “They’re the ones that forge raw ingredients by falsifying raw ingredient documents all the way to pharmaceutical companies.” He did not identify specific suppliers or give details to back up the claim. The WHO said the syrups were contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which it called “ toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents that can be fatal even taken in small amounts.” Their toxic effects include an inability to pass urine, kidney injury and death. The deaths have highlighted potential gaps in global regulation of commonly-used medications, including oversight of factories and supply chains, particularly those producing products for developing countries which lack the resources to monitor medicines for safety. The WHO sets guidelines on medicine manufacturing standards globally and supports countries investigating any lapses, but it has no legal mandate or enforcement authority to take direct action against violators. – Rappler.com"

Alvero, a US citizen of Filipino descent, was confirmed as one of at least 11 victims in a shooting rampage at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio. In an official statement, released by Valentino’s great niece Karmel Kwan on Tuesday, January 24 (Manila time), the Alvero family first condoled with other victims and their families over this “heart-shattering and life-altering” tragedy. “Overnight, we became unwilling members of a community who has to mourn the loss of our loved ones due to gun violence. We are left frustrated, stuck with this vicious cycle,” the Alvero family said. “Most importantly, please remember that Valentino is more than just a headline or a news story,” they said. The family described Alvero as a loving father, a dedicated son and brother, a grandfather who loved his three granddaughters “fiercely,” and an uncle who loved his nieces and nephews like they were his own. “He loved people and hearing about their lives and in return, he shared his own stories with so much gusto and enthusiasm that you couldn’t help but listen and laugh along with him,” they said. The family brought up Alvero’s love for dancing, his community, and how he was “the life of any party.” The family also asked Catholics to pray for him by name: Valentino Marcos Alvero. They also asked for prayers for the souls of all victims of mass shootings, and for an end to mass shootings in the US and the world. “He was a faithful servant of God and we know that he would want the world to lift his family in prayer more than anything,” the family said. Earlier on Tuesday, the Philippine consulate general in Los Angeles expressed “shock and great sadness” over the incident. “Our prayers go out to the families of the victims and we mourn with them during this lunar new year festival, which is supposed to be a time of gathering and celebration,” the consulate said. The consulate said it received news of Alvero’s death after closely monitoring the incident and sustained coordination with law enforcement, Filipino-American organizations, and the media. “The Consulate General understands his family’s desire for privacy and space during this time of unimaginable difficulty. Nevertheless, we are ready to assist them in whatever possible way should they reach out for any help we could give,” the consulate said. The consulate reminded the community to exercise vigilance “during these uncertain times,” to always monitor loved ones’ whereabouts, and immediately report any suspicious activities to local law enforcement.

https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/pakistan-power-grid-restored-january-24-2023/,[],"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – Pakistan’s energy minister on Tuesday blamed the worst power outage in months on a lack of investment in the network, saying the aid-dependant nation had “learned lessons” from the breakdown that left millions of people without electricity. Like much of the national infrastructure, the power network desperately needs an upgrade, but funding has been patchy as Pakistan lurched from one International Monetary Fund bailout to the next. The outage, which began on Monday morning, was the second major breakdown since October. “We learned lessons from yesterday that we need to invest in the distribution system,” Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir told reporters as he announced that power had been fully restored to the nation of nearly 220 million people. “There hasn’t been any investment in improving these systems from the previous government,” he added. The International Monetary Fund has bailed out Pakistan five times in the last two decades. Its latest bailout tranche, however, is stuck due to differences with the government over a programme review that should have been completed in November. Pakistan has enough installed power capacity to meet demand, but the sector is so heavily in debt that it cannot afford to invest in infrastructure and power lines. Analysts say transmission and distribution are the weakest links. China has invested in its power sector as part of a $60 billion infrastructure scheme that feeds into its “Belt and Road” initiative, but details of this investment are unclear. Dastgir said the cause of the outage was not yet known, but the ministry was conducting a safety audit of the entire network. “The government plans to add more power distribution lines within the next 36 months,” he added. Millions of Pakistanis suffer partial blackouts almost daily, including scheduled “load shedding” power outs aimed at conserving electricity. Many take these disruptions in their stride, investing in generators and solar panels to generate their own power, but the frail infrastructure also takes its toll. “Without electricity, we can’t do anything,” said Sara Khan, the principal of a school for girls in Jacobabad, a southern city which regularly goes up to 18 hours a day without power. “The people are facing too many difficulties because of the power cuts.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-says-maharlika-investment-fund-safe-money-laundering-hopes-fast-senate-passage/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. allayed fears that opening up the Maharlika fund to private investors would facilitate money laundering. “Yes, private monies will be involved with the fund, but it’s not a savings account that you just put it there and it stays there,” he said during a media interview on Monday, January 23. “Whenever we come into partnership, we do a G2G (Government-to-Government) with Japan, for example, or we do a PPP (Public-Private Partnership) with some big outfit, then that is only the time that the monies come into the fund to be used for the program.” “Hindi ‘yun basta’t, ‘O sige, bigyan niyo ako ng ilang bilyong dolyar tapos ilalagay lang ‘yan basta akong bahala na diyan (It’s not like, ‘Here’s a billion dollars to put in there, and I’ll leave you to it).’ It’s not like that at all,” he added. “Even on our end, we will only deploy funds when there is a very specific project to be paid for. So, money laundering just won’t come into it.” Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda previously floated the idea of allowing private investments in the fund through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). According to Salceda, he and three others were commissioned to rework the proposed Maharlika Investment Fund to be more “private-led.” This new version of the Maharlika fund, he said, was what Marcos pitched to investors at the World Economic Forum. Allowing private investments in the fund would reduce the government’s risk exposure since it would put in less capital, a suggestion that Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said the Senate would consider. “Gusto niya magkaroon ng IPO itong investment fund na ito para sa publiko makukuha ‘yung pondo and foreign investors para lalong lumaki ang pondo at less risk para sa ating government institutions. So, these are the things that we are looking into. Maganda din ‘yung mga proposals na iyan, pero kailangan natin tingnan kung ano ang effect nito sa ating bansa,” Zubiri said in a radio interview with DWIZ on Saturday, January 21. (Salceda wants an IPO for the investment fund so that the funding comes from the public and foreign investors so that it grows more at less risk to government instutions. So, these are things that we are looking into. These are also good proposals, but we need to see what the effect is on our country.) The revised version would also drop dividends of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas from the fund’s seed capital, opting instead to source money from dividends coming from government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs). Salceda claimed that doing so would ensure that only “real surpluses” were used for the fund. However, President Marcos has now joined the growing number of voices questioning this proposal. Marcos said that in a meeting, both he and Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno found that using these dividends would not be feasible, with the President noting that it was “too disruptive.” “You cannot use funds of the GOCC, pera ng gobyerno ‘yun. What will the government spend? It was a proposal. It’s not something that we have adopted,” said the President. “Think, every single GOCC has its own charter,” Marcos clarified during the media interview. “You will then revise all of those charters to align with the Maharlika fund. That’s not the purpose of the GOCC, number one. Number two, this is a lot of income that goes to the national government that will … go into the Maharlika fund and cannot be used for the budget of the national government. And we have many things that we would like to appropriate in the coming years, and we will need those funds.” Senators, who are soon to begin discussions on the bill, have raised similar concerns around the use of GOCC dividends. Zubiri and Senator Sherwin ‘Win’ Gatchalian both cautioned against viewing these dividends as surpluses, saying that redirecting them to the fund would also mean they would no longer contribute to the national budget. Retired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio also said that from a legal perspective, the dividends from government corporations can’t be considered surpluses on their own since they are meant to be added to the government’s total revenue. “Based on the One Fund Concept as written in several laws, the dividends of GOCCs are not surpluses since the dividends are consolidated with all other government revenues to arrive at the total government revenues for the fiscal year, against which will be deducted all the authorized government expenditures under the GAA. The net amount will either be the surplus or deficit,” Carpio told Rappler on Saturday, January 21. Introduced only in late November, the Maharlika fund proposal steamrolled past Congress on December 15, 2022, after Marcos certified it as urgent. The Senate is expected to begin discussions on the controversial sovereign wealth fund now that Senator Mark Villar has filed a counterpart bill. So far, the Senate bill is identical to the one passed by the House, but Zubiri noted that he expects it to still undergo multiple revisions. “Unless we adopt the House version na ‘yung walang amendments, anything is possible in the realm of legislation kasi ano pa iyan eh, dadaan pa ng committee level, so yung mga amendments na pinopropose ni Cong. Joey Salceda and Congresswoman (Stella) Quimbo, puwede pa rin ‘yan isama sa committee amendments ng Senate as suggestions from the House of Representatives,” he said. (Unless we adopt the House version with no amendments, anything is possible in the realm of legislation since it will still pass the committee level, so the amendments proposed by Congressman Joey Salceda and Congresswoman Stella Quimbo can be included in the committee amendments of the Senate as suggestions from the House of Representatives.) Zubiri estimated that the proposal may clear the committee on banks – which is also chaired by Villar –  before the Senate adjourns for the Holy Week break on March 23. The bill might then be approved following the break, Zubiri said. President Marcos approved of the speedy timeline given by Zubiri, but emphasized that careful study is still needed. “In terms of schedule, nag-release ng statement si Senate President na baka by Holy Week matapos na. Maganda ‘yun. That would be good. But, ako sa akin, mas importante na maging tama kaysa maging mabilis,” he said. (In terms of schedule, the Senate President has already released a statement that it might be ready by Holy Week. That’s good. That would be good. But for me, it’s more important to be correct than to be fast.) “Ang message ko sa Senado, suriin ninyo nang mabuti para magandang-maganda ‘yung batas natin,” the President said. (My message to the Senate is to study it well so that the law comes out very well.) – Rappler.com"

After missing 10 of 13 shots and committing six turnovers in a loss at Minnesota last game, Green was electric down the stretch in the rematch. The Timberwolves trailed by 11 early in the fourth quarter, but Anthony Edwards pulled them within 100-99 on a 3-pointer with 5:06 left. Green responded with a driving layup, a 3-pointer, an elbow jumper and a blocked shot in succession. He answered another Edwards trey with a 3-pointer of his own for a 112-103 lead with 41 seconds left. Green added a free throw with 10.7 seconds left. Green shot 15 of 25 from the floor including 6 of 12 from behind the arc. Alperen Sengun added 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists as Houston ended a 10-game homecourt skid. Edwards paced the Timberwolves with 31 points, 17 in the fourth quarter, while D’Angelo Russell matched his season high of 30 points while dishing out seven assists. Rudy Gobert returned from a three-game absence caused by a groin injury and contributed 15 points and 16 rebounds, but Minnesota failed in a bid to climb above .500 for the first time this month. A first half of alternating runs continued in the third. Green sank a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that gave the Rockets a 90-81 lead entering the final period. Houston shot 61.9 percent in the first quarter, including 12-of-15 success inside the arc while recording 18 points in the paint. However, the Rockets guilty of five turnovers in the frame, and after securing a 29-17 lead, allowed Edwards to single-handedly lift Minnesota back into contention. Edwards scored seven of his 10 first-quarter points in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the period, a run that enabled the Timberwolves to slice the deficit to five points entering the second. Russell scored 13 points during an 18-5 Timberwolves surge in the second, including three successive treys, as Minnesota grabbed a 48-42 lead with 3:32 left in the half. The Rockets clawed back to pull even entering the intermission, 56-56. Russell tallied 19 points in the half to counter Green and his 21 first-half points. – Rappler.com"

It’s very dynamic, it’s constantly in flux so you have to pay attention to it.” However, on January 9, 2023, the Philippine Coast Guard reported that a Chinese Coast Guard vessel drove away a Filipino fishing boat at Ayungin Shoal, despite the “agreement” earlier mentioned by President Marcos Jr. “that China will not stop our fishermen from fishing.” As chief protector of our national territory, we are thankful that the challenges to our country’s sovereignty and sovereign rights are foremost in the mind of our President. We understand that the South China Sea dispute may be a complex and dynamic set of issues, politically, economically, and diplomatically. However, there is one anchor that will bring much clarity to this dispute, and that is the Rule of Law. Without the Rule of Law as an anchor, one can get lost in the sea of countless interests and pressures from various individuals, groups, and states. One can be accused of treason by making the wrong choice that prejudices national interest. By faithfully abiding by the Rule of Law, Mr. President, you can only do right because a choice pursuant to the Rule of Law is supported by your people and the international community, and advances our national interest. In the South China Sea dispute, the Rule of Law is embodied in the 2016 Arbitral Award won by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In this regard, the President is correct when he also said in Davos that “we have no conflicting claims with China” in terms of our sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea, given that the UNCLOS Award already settled that the West Philippine Sea exclusively belongs to Filipinos. Nonetheless, China is persisting in its illegal claim in our waters, like a thief who was already been ordered by a court to return the stolen property to the owner. Thus, the action to be undertaken at this point is the enforcement of the UNCLOS Award. Among the ways to enforce the UNCLOS Award are: consistently raising the Award at the United Nations General Assembly and other international fora; engaging in joint patrols and military exercises in our waters and further consolidating the support of countries which believe in the UNCLOS Award and the Rule of Law; making China accountable for the environmental crimes it committed in the West Philippine Sea; and building a minimum credible defense posture to protect our national territory. Keeping faith in the Rule of Law allows us to treat each other fairly and in the spirit of sovereign equality. It provides the rules with which nations can relate and work together. It reduces arbitrariness and unilateralism. Fidelity to the Rule of Law allows us not only the means to resolve differences, but also the substance on which to build better understanding to resolve disputes such as those in the South China Sea. Follow the Rule of Law, Mr. President. You can be sure that the Filipinos will be with you. – Rappler.com Albert del Rosario is Chair of the Stratbase ADR Institute, former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and former Philippine Ambassador to the United States."
https://www.rappler.com/business/analysts-reactions-proposed-south-american-common-currency/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – South America is not likely to have a common currency bloc to rival the euro any time soon, analysts said on Monday, January 23, despite excited chatter sparked by officials in Brazil and Argentina raising the prospect of a shared tender. On Monday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said they were in early talks to establish a shared unit of value for bilateral trade, though this would not replace the real or peso currencies. That came after the leaders had touted a “common South American currency” on Sunday, January 22, and officials told the Financial Times the tender could even be called the “sur” and eventually look to bring in other countries around South America. Analysts were quick to knock that down, following decades of similar talk with little to show for it, including shelved plans for a so-called “gaucho” for Argentina-Brazil trade in 1987 and former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro touting a currency union in 2019. “I’m very skeptical this initiative will see the light of day,” said Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer, Emerging Markets Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, citing the region’s poor track record in economic integration. “It has failed to achieve simpler integration goals than that of a common currency.” A common tender, like the euro, would need shared political frameworks and institutions that analysts said would take decades to establish. South America’s countries have vastly different economic situations – Argentina, for instance, has struggled with inflation for a long time, and it is currently at an eye-watering annual rate of 95%. Venezuela – whose president Nicolas Maduro said on Monday that his country was prepared to support an initiative such as a common currency – has suffered with even higher hyperinflation as well as economic collapse. Other South American economies, including Uruguay and Chile, have long been more stable. “It’s been a conversation for many years. I see the benefit for Argentina but what’s in it for Brazil? Much less Uruguay and Paraguay,” said Eric Farnsworth, a vice president at the Council of the Americas and Americas Society. He called the idea of a currency union a “fantasy.” Kimberley Sperrfechter, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that Lula, inaugurated this month, had other things to focus on, including his economic and fiscal plans. Currency union talk was just a distraction, she said. “Markets are likely to be unimpressed by the news of a combined currency, not least because it will take years to implement, if it’s implemented at all,” she said. In Argentina, meanwhile, general elections in October could see center-left Fernandez toppled by a resurgent conservative opposition, likely scuppering any longer-term currency plans between the two leftist allies. Todd Martinez, a director at Fitch Ratings’ sovereigns group focused on Latin America, said the two countries appeared to be unlikely partners to form a successful currency union, given their diverging economies. Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Tellimer, agreed, emphasizing that it made even less sense for Brazil – the region’s biggest economy, with a currency that outperformed the dollar last year. Argentina’s peso, on the other hand, has slumped despite strict currency controls. “For Brazil in particular, despite its own policy credibility challenges, why it would wish to tie itself to a smaller neighbor with such a checkered track record on policy credibility is anyone’s guess,” he said in a note. But some were more optimistic about the long-term potential. “The process of LatAm integration needs a North Star – and this is the best possible one. Because it would create a larger single market and better negotiating conditions with other large blocs,” Pierpaolo Barbieri, head of Argentine digital payments firm Uala, wrote on Twitter. “Of course a monetary union between Brazil and Argentina is unrealistic today.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/los-angeles-lakers-trade-kendrick-nunn-washington-wizards-rui-hachimura-january-23-2023/,[],"The Los Angeles Lakers finalized a deal to send guard Kendrick Nunn and three second-round draft picks to the Washington Wizards to acquire forward Rui Hachimura on Monday (Tuesday, January 24, Manila time). Hachimura, 24, is averaging 13.0 points and 4.3 rebounds in 30 games off the Wizards’ bench this season. “Adding both size and depth to the wing position has been a goal, and the chance to accomplish that by acquiring a player with Rui’s two-way skills and upside was an opportunity that doesn’t present itself often,” Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said in a release. Hachimura was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He started all 105 games he played in over his first two seasons with the Wizards before being relegated to a reserve role.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/review-tender-short-film-collection-tarzeer-pictures/,[],"Spoilers ahead. In the local film circuit, the month of January is often reserved for preparations as festival organizers, curators, critics, reviewers, and earnest cinephiles jumpstart another busy film year, opening calls for submissions (see Cinema Rehiyon and Sine Kabataan’s ongoing calls for entries), holding special talks and screenings (see Sine Pop and Cinematheque Centre Manila’s initiatives), and handing out awards to what are arguably the best Filipino films of the previous year (see the Society of Filipino Film Reviewers’ annual Pinoy Rebyu Awards). Manila-based gallery and creative content group Tarzeer Pictures also offers early appetizers for the local audience, boasting a slate of Filipino short films that finds a common thread in how they craft a snapshot of our zeitgeist, reinforce dance as a cinematic space, and confront head-on the liminality of contemporary life. Here are my insights on the four-film roster, forgoing the need to rank them but instead listing and discussing them in the order that I’ve consumed each film: Recently, news of climate change activists allegedly damaging world-renowned artworks, such as Vincent van Gogh’s The Sower and Sunflowers and Sandro Botticelli’s Primavera, have been sparking conversations online, interrogating the museum industrial complex, the liberal tendencies of this protest strategy, and the supposed threshold of civility that dictates what protest acts must count as “good activism.” Temporary Fix negotiates with this premise as the film follows a group of performance artists who devise a ploy to smear cake on Leonardo da Vinci’s highly-valued Mona Lisa. The film teems with life by trading dialogue for dance as the medium of its narrative, depicting how body language is just as evocative as the spoken one — an artistic decision elevated by its visual acuity and frenetic editing. A scene in the middle of the film where the group dances under alternating lights brings to mind the hypnotic opening dance sequence in Kogonada’s sci-fi drama After Yang (2021), thanks in large part to Madge Reyes’s choreography and Daniel Cho’s original music. But when the energy dies down, one cannot help but feel how fleeting the viewing experience is and how shorthanded the film’s critique comes across, like a temporary piece that could use some more calibration. In a burning world, how do we keep warm? This is the Sisyphean challenge that Apa Agbayani’s We Kept Warm weighs up. Combining intimate storytelling with an assured visual language, particularly through Sasha Palomares’s camerawork and Whammy Alcazaren’s production design, the director uproots the ethos of our current social condition, of a world caught in the throes of waiting. We see Nemo (played remarkably by Cindy Lopez) attempt to translate her grief into a shared language. But like the sweater that she knits, she begins to realize she is pulling at loose threads, unraveling the fragility and uncertainty of her sheltered life. Yet Nemo soldiers on, even when destruction charges like wildfire. Armed by Augie Balignasay’s VFX, Agbayani’s rendering of the window, where Nemo often looks out from, is a wise artistic decision, as it becomes a site where the protagonist’s internal turmoil gets juxtaposed against the madness of the outside world, where memory and forgetting intersect. Of course, it’s convenient to file We Kept Warm under the library of pandemic films. But by not trying to be something it is not, the film manages to extend its emotional heft into universal themes, effectively creating a tapestry of our ever-volatile zeitgeist, never mind the sentimentality. So when Nemo gets overwhelmed by her grief amidst her helplessness, we also allow ourselves to be consumed by it. We sit still and find comfort in silence, slowly recognizing the small aches we have long harbored in hopes of healing from it. The first thing you will notice about Jed Gregorio’s Faun is how it owes its structure to Zoom cinema, with the camera often placed before the subject, steady and static, resembling homemade footage. Divided into three acts, the film reimagines the story of the titular mythical creature through “a study of masculinity performed in the midst of oneself,” as its logline warrants. We observe the faun (played by Karl Rummel) kill time within the confines of his room, converse in front of a camera without hearing who’s at the other end of the line, and bare his vulnerability through dance, as if trying to navigate a zoetrope of madness in times of isolation. But while the film interrogates an interesting premise, one cannot ignore how its visual language fails to keep up with the weight of its text, which, to some extent, is a production constraint. If anything, the preceding imagery limits, in many ways, what translates onscreen instead of building upon it. It also does not help that the film feels the urge to unveil its subtext, diluting its nuance, wittingly or unwittingly. In the end, Faun comes off as more imagined than tangible. What’s immediately compelling about Lem Atienza’s thesis film is its sense of completeness. Burgeoning ballet dancer Abril (Tommy Alejandrino) preps for a critical audition. But when he misplaces an anklet gifted by his love interest Julian (Carlos Dala), who died in a car accident, Abril is forced to come to terms with his tragic past, halting his performance altogether. While the script and the acting from the two leads still require some fine-tuning, Moving Remnant succeeds in weaving a drama that hinges on a strong emotional core. The cinematography, wielded with precision by Michael Derwin Musni, provides the film with transfixing images at every turn, especially when the camera stays on the characters’ faces, allowing the ripples of emotions to linger further and deeper. The spaces in which the story operates adds more nuance and texture to the film. As Atienza notes in the accompanying discussion about his creative process, the Metropolitan Theater and Nude Floor, which have endured many heavy hitters, inform the changes that Abril goes through, extending him compassion and a site to process his grief and, in the same breath, unlocking conversations about identity, history, politics, and memory. This journey culminates in a soulful choreography by Joshua Enciso, who also doubles as the mentor, as Alejandrino turns in a devastating yet beautiful dance performance, sketching Abril’s catharsis — his making and unmaking — and narrowing the gap between past and present, just as the closing frame offers the lead character breathing space, a possibility to begin again. – Rappler.com All films are streaming for free on the Tarzeer website."
https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-janet-yellen-urges-zambia-debt-restructure-after-talks-china/,[],"LUSAKA, Zambia – US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday, January 23, during a visit to Zambia that it was critically important to restructure the country’s debt, and she believes progress could be made after her frank talks with key creditor China last week. Yellen added that Zambia’s debt overhang was a drag on its whole economy and that China had been a barrier to resolving the southern African country’s debt problem. However, she said she was encouraged that progress could shortly become possible following her meeting with Chinese officials in Zurich last week. “I specifically raised the issue with Zambia [with Chinese officials] and asked for their cooperation in trying to reach a speedy resolution. And our talks were constructive,” Yellen said. She told Zambian Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane that the timely finalization of Zambia’s debt treatment was a top priority for the Treasury. “We will continue to press for all official bilateral and private-sector creditors to meaningfully participate in debt relief for Zambia, especially China,” she said. Yellen said she was keen to continue talks with Musokotwane and other Zambian officials about the country’s “impressive progress” on economic reforms, and how regional economic integration and deepening trade ties could support the country’s growth. However, Musokotwane said at the start of a bilateral meeting with Yellen that the debt restructuring process has been moving slowly and its outcome was not certain. Calling for the help of global leaders to move the restructuring process forward, he said it was needed to create conditions conducive to investments and to reduce pressure on Zambians to migrate. During a meeting with President Hakainde Hichilema, who took charge in August 2021, Yellen told the Zambian leader a debt treatment deal under the Common Framework was “overdue.” A senior Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said US officials believed progress was possible soon given intensified discussions with China. However, there were two main sticking points with China, the official added: Beijing’s insistence that local debt owned by foreign investors be included, and that multilateral development banks also take a haircut – both of which points have been rejected by the United States, Zambia, and other countries. Yellen told reporters it was important for Zambia to address corruption and human rights, and to create a business environment that would promote investment and trade. She lauded Hichilema for making the fight against corruption an important part of his agenda. “It’s something that needs continued focus,” she said. “I would say the work isn’t done, but there clearly has been an important focus on it.” In response, the Chinese embassy in Zambia said “the biggest contribution that the US can make to the debt issues outside the country is to act on responsible monetary policies, cope with its own debt problem, and stop sabotaging other sovereign countries’ active efforts to solve their debt issues.” The comments were made in a post on the embassy’s official website on Tuesday, January 24. Yellen’s meeting with Musokotwane took place at Zambia’s finance ministry, where large signs with slogans such as “This is a corruption-free zone” and “Say NO to corruption. Integrity is a virtue” were on prominent display in the hallways. Yellen is on a three-country visit to Africa. In Senegal, she said Russia’s war in Ukraine was hitting Africans particularly hard by exacerbating food insecurity and putting an unnecessary drag on the continent’s economy. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-divergent-leadership-mindsets-lessons-jacinda-ardern-bongbong-marcos/,[],"The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, announced this week that she no longer has the energy to seek re-election in October and is stepping down when her term ends February 7. “Leading a country is the most privileged job anyone could ever have, but also the most challenging,” she told CNN. “You cannot and should not do the job unless you have a full tank – plus a bit in reserve for those unplanned and unexpected challenges.” She said she no longer had enough in the tank to do the job justice. Ardern rose to power in 2017 at the age of 37. Among her challenges: a terrorist attack, a volcanic eruption, the coronavirus pandemic. She also gave birth while in office. Ardern is generally seen as a decisive, progressive leader. She is admired globally for her swift response to the pandemic that spared her country from the virus’ more serious effects, and for her humanity and empathy for the victims of terrorism. Some world leaders sent well wishes upon hearing of her decision to leave. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Twitter that Ardern had shown the world how to lead with intellect and strength. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanks her for her emphatic, compassionate, strong, and steady leadership over these past several years. Of course, it is not all praise for the outgoing leader. There are those who say that Ardern has not been able to deliver on the promise of transformation she made when she first assumed office. Some say she might be stepping down now so that she would not suffer a humiliating loss in October. At home, her popularity is reportedly at its lowest since 2017. But Ardern, who used to be a DJ and a cashier at a fish-and-chips restaurant, and who was named in her high school yearbook as Most Likely to Become Prime Minister, is also said to be genuine, authentic, and transparent – no public or private version of herself. And she says she is tired. “Politicians are human,” she said. “We give all that we can for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.” “I had hoped that I would find what I need to carry on over that period. But unfortunately, I haven’t, and I would be doing a disservice to New Zealand to continue.” ** Over in Davos, Switzerland, another head of state claims to be a reluctant leader – at least at first. During a one-on-one session with World Economic Forum President Børge Brende on January 18, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he had to become a politician upon their family’s return from exile because the legacy of his father and their own survival required that somebody go into politics. In his 20s, he said, as he was “coming out of university,” he had seen much of the sacrifices that his father was making such that he did not want to follow in Marcos Sr.’s footsteps. But life takes you places you do not expect to go, he said. Overall, during the meetings in Switzerland, Marcos Jr. said all the right things that a good leader is supposed to say to “sell” his country to the international community. He extolled our young and able workforce, highlighted the need for upskilling and retooling, said that unemployment was going down, committed to focus on the micro, small and mid-sized enterprises, (MSME), acknowledged the contributions of the BPO, mining, and semiconductor sectors as well as OFW remittances, acknowledged that the bureaucracy had to become digital, resolved to learn from the lessons of the pandemic, specifically on the weaknesses of our economy, and announced that the government would get into more partnerships with the private sector especially in infrastructure projects. He professed that national interest would be the sole determinant of our foreign policy. He is employed by neither Beijing nor Washington, he said. In Davos, there was no mention of the high prices of basic commodities, the practical unattainability of onions, nothing about the deplorable state of public transportation, nothing of the taxes that remain unacknowledged and unpaid, and nothing of the dark days that Filipinos endured during Martial Law. The dark days that Mr. Marcos did mention were the time that his family was in exile, uncertain if  they could ever come back. Interestingly, he said those were dark days for the country, too. But they did come back. Oh, how they did. Watching the half-an-hour conversation between Marcos and Brende, one cannot help getting more than a whiff of entitlement to power as the Philippine president spoke, as if being in power were a birthright, as if he were compelled to save his father’s legacy, as if their family were superior to all other families in the land. So when was it ever about the people, then? When is it? What happened to the desire to serve? Alas, this is not a mindset peculiar to the Marcoses. Many prominent families in many parts of the country share the same sentiment about being in politics. This is why we have extended families in the branches of government, at the national and local levels. This is why provinces that have been under a family’s rule for so long have never progressed. This is why people are submissive and deferential to public officials instead of seeing them as people whose salaries they pay. This is why we have violence during elections. This is why we find ourselves stuck in the same rut. Politicians think this way – and the tragedy is, we allow them to. We reward them with our adulation and our votes. On the contrary, it’s refreshing to see politicians who think of public office as a real job which they must carry out well and for which they are accountable. We wish there were more of those who do not see themselves, much less their families, as indispensable to the life of the nation. Despite their efforts and their intentions, they always know when their time is up. The rest, on the other hand, believe in eternity. – Rappler.com Adelle Chua is assistant professor of journalism at the UP College of Mass Communication.

https://www.rappler.com/business/russian-tycoon-vladimir-potanin-tells-kremlin-tolerate-dissident-remote-workers/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – One of Russia’s richest tycoons called on the authorities on Monday, January 23, to tolerate rather than punish hundreds of thousands of workers who have fled abroad due to Moscow’s war in Ukraine, arguing that the country needs their brain power. “People who work for our economy from abroad – remotely or otherwise – should not be punished,” billionaire metals executive Vladimir Potanin told the online RBC news portal, calling for an end to talk of punitive measures against them, something he called “demagoguery.” He said Moscow had to be tolerant even if remote workers held views which Russian patriots disliked, a reference to the fact that many of those who left – including IT specialists – did so to avoid being drafted into the army or because they disagreed with what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, launched on February 24 last year. Potanin is estimated to be Russia’s richest or second richest person thanks to his stake in metals giant Nornickel. The scale of the exodus – put at up to 700,000 people by some Russian media, a figure the Kremlin has suggested is exaggerated – has fueled fears of a brain drain at a time when Russia is under tough Western economic sanctions. Maksut Shadaev, the head of Russia’s ministry of digital affairs, told parliament in December that around 100,000 IT specialists had left Russia in 2022. A sometimes vitriolic debate about how to treat such people has gripped Russia’s political and business elite for weeks. Hardliners such as former president Dmitry Medvedev have called some of those who fled “traitors” who should never be allowed back home. Other hawkish politicians have advocated hitting remote workers and émigrés with higher taxes and stripping them of their passports and Russian assets. They are mulling legislation that would ban remote working in some sectors altogether. Conversely, reports in Russia’s business daily Kommersant about plans being examined by the ministry of digital affairs, suggest it wants to lure specialists back with relocation packages and exemptions from being drafted into the army. The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, but has made clear it opposes proposals to ban IT workers from leaving the country or levying higher taxes on those who do. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments last week to online news portal Life, said that while the state must fight its “enemies” it must also ensure that Russians who had not adopted a hostile stance to their country and its policies should be able to return home. Potanin said Moscow badly needs remote workers including computer programmers to help its battered economy recover. “Most of them continue to work for our country, our economy, our companies. Some of them will come back, some will not. So why push them away and persecute them?” Potanin told RBC. Programmers working remotely are “our strength, not our weakness, their brains, their ability to produce a product, which, incidentally, we are woefully short of,” he said, estimating that Russia was able to supply only 20% of its own software needs. Suggestions that they should have their apartments or other assets confiscated amount to theft and would weaken Russia’s investment potential, Potanin added. One doctor who fled Russia for a country in the European Union last February said he was skeptical of any sweeteners the authorities might offer to lure people back. “No one is convinced these measures will work,” said the doctor, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals. “Stop the war first and then make people feel like they are masters of their own destiny.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/south-cotabato-governnor-tamayo-jr-message-anti-mining-groups/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – South Cotabato Governor Reynaldo Tamayo Jr. on Monday, January 23, called on groups opposed to the ongoing coal mining operations in Lake Sebu town to go to court, saying his hands were tied because it was the national government that allowed it. Tamayo said the mining operations by subsidiaries of San Miguel Corporation have the approval of the Department of Energy (DOE). “That cannot be stopped. They (anti-mining groups) want me to stop it, but it would be difficult with those huge bulldozers there,” he said. The governor claimed he had nothing to do with the ongoing coal mining in Lake Sebu town. It was the previous South Cotabato provincial board, he said, that approved a resolution that interposed no objection to the mining operations. “I was even bypassed [by the provincial board],” Tamayo said. Tamayo also asked groups opposed to the mining operations in South Cotabato why they did not express their opposition to coal mining in the village of Ned with the same intensity as they did when another mining giant, Sagittarius Mines Incorporated (SMI), operated in the province. He noted that the SMI operations were greeted with large anti-mining rallies, but there was none like that at the time San Miguel’s subsidiaries – Daguma Agro Minerals Incorporated (DAMI) and Sultan Energy Philippine Corporation (SEPC) – were still securing government permits. The local Catholic archdiocese and environmental groups have been criticizing South Cotabato officials for being indifferent to calls for them to protect communities from the adverse effects of the mining operations. They have called on government officials to heed demands for them to take a strong stand and enforce a provincial ordinance that bans open pit mining province-wide. Provincial officials earlier said they doubted if a local law can stop the national government from allowing mining companies to operate in South Cotabato. San Miguel’s subsidiaries have been deploying earth-moving equipment to Lake Sebu for clearing operations. The companies have so far caused a school to be relocated and displaced hundreds of residents. Tamayo has asked the miners to help the affected villagers by relocating them to a safer area. Through its subsidiaries, San Miguel plans to extract 70 million metric tons of coal in areas covering around 17,000 hectares in South Cotabato up to Sultan Kudarat province. Lawyer Noel Ben, director of the Marist Hope Center for Justice and Good Governance, said there was a need to further make people in South Cotabato aware of the potentially irreversible damage to the ecosystem that would be caused by the mining operations. Legal action may be taken as a last resort, Ben said. Father Angel Buenavides, vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marbel, said he was worried because the mining companies were operating in a watershed area. The village of Ned is within a watershed area and is home to the world’s largest eagle, and around 50 species of amphibians and reptiles, 30% of which are found only in the Philippines. The coal mining operations in Ned cover nine hectares where at least 300 sinkholes and landslide-prone areas were found by experts in 2019. Rolly Aquino, chief of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO), said the sinkholes and erosion areas were found in the districts of El Dolog, Tuburan, Polosubong, Kiantay, and Tawang Dagat. An initial assessment report by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) in Soccsksargen attributed the land surface movements and landslides to the coal deposits underneath. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/brazil-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-floats-shared-trading-currency-argentina-trip/,[],"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina – Brazil and Argentina are in early talks to establish a shared unit of value for bilateral trade to reduce reliance on the US dollar, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Monday, January 23, though the move is not aimed at replacing existing currencies. In Buenos Aires on his first international visit since taking office, Lula made the comments alongside Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, a leftist ally, who said there was little decided about what would be involved in such a proposal. The discussions surfaced as part of an agreement to boost bilateral trade with more Brazilian export financing backed by Argentina’s international collateral. Argentina’s economy is suffering from a series of challenges, including a lack of dollars, with the government battling to replenish foreign currency reserves while also grappling with an inflation rate of nearly 100% last year. Leaders from both countries are meeting at a regional summit in the Argentine capital, where Lula vowed to resume a closer relationship after former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro distanced himself from Argentina. “Our finance ministers, each with his own economic team, can make us a proposal for foreign trade and transactions between the two countries that is done in a common currency,” Lula told reporters alongside Fernandez. Fernandez said that he and Lula also discussed the possibility of shipping gas from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale formation to its neighbor. Brazil’s development bank BNDES may finance the building of a pipeline to deliver the gas, Lula said. Brazil’s Finance Executive Secretary Gabriel Galipolo told Reuters that the currency, or “regional unit of account,” would come alongside extra credit to support exports to Argentina through Brazilian banks that operate locally. Brazil’s government would offer guarantees to banks that helped provide financing, while Argentina, a major grains exporter, would have to provide collateral via hard assets like grains, gas, or oil. Under the plan, the Brazilian real and Argentine peso would continue to exist, with the new tender targeted narrowly at trade. Brazil’s Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said the presidents of both countries requested the creation of a clearing house with a common currency to settle accounts. The currency has no name or deadline and would not seek euro-style monetary unification, he added. – Rappler.com"

The post came with an artwork of herself in her Darna national costume. “The entire year has been the most challenging, and yet most exciting, time of my life,” she said. “To represent my country, the Philippines, is my greatest honor.” Celeste shared that she has always had a “burning passion” for the Philippines and that she plans to continue pursuing her identity as a Filipina. “I challenged myself and stepped out of my comfort zone by flying here alone as a very young woman. I’ve always known by heart that there are no limits to what you can achieve as long as you are committed to the vision and your intentions are pure, as I have done by pushing myself beyond my limits in the services of my advocacies, training, and learning,” she said. She added that she is still discovering purposes that go “beyond [her] self-ambitions.” “I am immensely grateful to have had the chance to represent all Filipinos and all the sweet fans of pageantry around the world,” she said. Celeste then proceeded to express her gratitude to her team, whom she referred to as her “safe place,” as well as her fans, family, and loved ones. “I now believe that my purpose is to inspire, and I will never stop inspiring and motivating all of you, with or without the Universe Crown. I am committed,” she said. “To my country, I stand proud to be a Filipina.” She also remembered her late father, whom she called her “guardian angel.” “If you are redirecting me to a different path, to what is truly meant for me, I trust you and I know I still am in the right place at the right time,” she said. Celeste then concluded her post with the signature, “Forever your Miss Philippines.” Celeste failed to advance to the top 16 of the competition during the coronation night held in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA on January 14  – marking the end of the Philippines’ 12-year streak of entering the pageant’s semifinals round.

The shooting in Half Moon Bay, about 30 miles (50 km) south of San Francisco, came on the heels of another mass shooting in the southern California city of Monterey Park on Saturday, January 21, that killed 11 people. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was visiting Monterey Park victims in the hospital when he was called away and informed of the shooting in Half Moon Bay, about 380 miles (610 km) to the north. “Tragedy upon tragedy,” Newsom said on Twitter. The rural area was recently pounded by a series of heavy rainstorms that caused extensive damage, affecting immigrant laborers in the area, farm worker advocates said. A series of atmospheric rivers in the three weeks following Christmas killed 20 people statewide. San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus identified the suspect as Chunli Zhao, 67, and said he worked at one of the shooting locations. Corpus called the sites nurseries, and other officials said they were staffed by farm workers. Local media described at least one of them as a mushroom farm. “There were farm workers affected tonight. There were children on the scene at the incidents. This is a truly heartbreaking tragedy in our community,” San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller told reporters. “The amount of stress that’s been on this community for weeks is really quite high.” The suspect was cooperating with investigators but a motive had yet to be established, Corpus said. A semi-automatic handgun was found in his car, she said. Deputies responding to a call found four people dead and a fifth victim with life-threatening wounds at the first location in Half Moon Bay, then found three more dead at another place nearby, Corpus told a news conference. Video on ABC 7 from the Bay Area showed the arrest as two men in plainclothes and one uniformed deputy, guns drawn, ordered the man out of his car. The suspect came out, was thrown to the ground and searched for weapons. Multiple uniformed officers quickly arrived on the scene with long guns. Corpus said investigators speculate that the suspect drove to the station to turn himself in. The description of car and license plate were already circulating among law enforcement when a deputy spotted the car in the parking lot, Corpus said. A woman who witnessed the arrest told reporters she had gone to the sheriff’s department to get more information as she was involved in agriculture and concerned about the well-being of the farm workers. “I came down here to find out what I could about the situation and why this happened and I hadn’t expected to get quite that close to it,” Kati McHugh told reporters on the scene. “It was a little too close for my comfort.” There were 38 mass shootings in the United States in the first 21 days of the year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which describes a mass shooting as four or more people shot or killed, not including the shooter. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/california-shooting-suspect-regular-monterey-park-dance-studio/,[],"CALIFORNIA, USA – The 72-year-old suspected gunman in Saturday night’s mass shooting at a Los Angeles-area dance studio had been a regular there, giving informal lessons and even meeting his ex-wife at the venue, according to friends and media reports. Authorities say Huu Can Tran fired 42 rounds at a celebration of the Lunar New Year at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, popular in the predominantly Asian-American city of Monterey Park, east of Los Angeles. The death toll rose to 11 on Monday, January 23. Tran went to another dance club in the neighboring city of Alhambra soon after the massacre, police say, but a patron there wrestled away his gun, possibly thwarting a second attack. Tran died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Sunday as police approached a van he was driving. It is exceedingly rare for a person over 70 to carry out a mass shooting. While authorities have not identified a motive, some details have emerged about Tran’s background. Tran had at least one prior run-in with the law. In 1994, he was arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters. A search after the shooting revealed Tran had hundreds of rounds of ammunition at home, where investigators believe he was making his own silencers, Luna said. Adam Hood, who said he has been a tenant for years in a property Tran owned and spoke to him frequently, told Reuters that Tran was angry and did not have many friends, but liked ballroom dancing, his main social activity. “He was a good dancer,” said Hood, who met Tran in the early 2000s and said they bonded over their shared experience as Chinese immigrants. “But he was distrustful of the people at the studio, angry and distrustful. I think he just had enough.” Tran complained that people at the studio were talking behind his back, Hood said. CNN reported, citing an unnamed friend, that Tran complained the dance instructors said “evil things about him” and that Tran was “hostile” to a lot of people at the studio. On January 7 and January 9, Tran visited the police department in Hemet, the small city about 90 minutes east of Monterey Park where he lived, to make “past fraud, theft and poisoning allegations involving his family” stemming from 10 to 20 years ago, according to a statement from the department on Monday. Tran said he would come back with documentation but never returned, the statement said. A department spokesperson said police are not releasing more details about his claims at this time. In addition to the 9mm semi-automatic MAC-10 assault weapon that was wrested off him by 26-year-old bystander Brandon Tsay, Tran also had a .308 caliber rifle at home and a Norinco 7.62×25 handgun in his cargo van, Luna said. Tran had an active trucking license and previously owned a company called Tran’s Trucking starting in 2002. He lived in San Gabriel, near Monterey Park, from the early 1990s until around 2014, records show. Tran moved in 2020 to a mobile home in a private, gated senior living community with a nine-hole golf course in Hemet. He met his ex-wife at the dance studio about two decades ago, she told CNN in an interview. Tran introduced himself to her and offered her free lessons. While Tran was never violent, he was quick to anger, for instance, if she missed a step while dancing, she told CNN. They divorced in 2005. Efforts by Reuters to interview the ex-wife at a house listed in records as her residence were unsuccessful on Monday. Tran never remarried and did not have a girlfriend, according to Hood, his tenant. When asked at a news conference about reports that Tran may have acted out of jealousy, Monterey Park Police Chief Scott Wiese said, “We’re hearing those things, too, but have not confirmed any of that information.” A database of 185 mass shootings between 1966 and 2022 maintained by The Violence Project, a nonprofit, includes only one carried out by someone 70 or older: a retired miner who killed five people in a store in Allen, Kentucky, in 1981. – Rappler.com"

The gang leader, Ruben Dario da Silva Villar, is already in police detention after being charged along with three other people for double homicide and concealment of corpses.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-defends-cost-foreign-trips-return-on-investment/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday, January 23, defended his frequent travels, telling a panel of television journalists and presenters to “look at [the expenses] as ROI (return on investment).” “In terms of the cost, you know, the way I see it, you have to look at it as ROI. Do we bring something back or do we not?” said Marcos in an interview with several select media personalities in Malacañang Palace. Marcos was asked if his administration would publicize how much his many trips – to Indonesia, Singapore, the United States, Singapore again, Cambodia, Thailand, and Brussels in 2022, and China and Switzerland in 2023 – cost Filipino taxpayers. Initially, the Philippine president said he did not have the figures ready. When pressed if they would eventually be “revealed,” Marcos said it would, “once we’ve calculated everything.” Of his trips, three are state visits while the rest were made to attend international and regional gatherings. In defending his trip, Marcos highlighted the pledges or promises his administration got from governments and private businesses. “Now, the measure of success will be, you know, cost-benefit, very simple. How much effort did you put into it? It’s not just the money. It’s the time that you put into it. It’s the time and the effort that goes into it is really… That’s what I was trying to explain earlier. The reason that we have everyone on the delegation,” he said. Pledges, however, don’t always turn into anything concrete. Marcos highlighted the over $22 billion pledged to the Philippines during his January 2023 state visit to China – but did not mention that China pledged almost just as much during his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s time without most of them materializing. What exactly would “ROI” mean in the context of his trips abroad? The President’s answer was long and indirect: “So again, the way I approach this is ROI. How much did you spend? How much did you get? And again, as I’m saying, if we get just one of the MOUs, isa lang, napakahina naman natin if isa lang ang makuha natin. Hindi namin ginagawa trabaho namin kung isa lang makukuha natin. But sabihin na lang natin, isa lang ang makuha natin. Bawi na lahat nung trip ko.” (…just one, that’s really incompetent of us if we only get one. That means we aren’t doing our jobs right if we only get one. But say we do get one? That makes up for all my trips.) Marcos also defended his delegation size, saying it was just select Cabinet, their staff, and security. What he didn’t mention, however, are the people who tag along who are not staff or security – his sons who aren’t in government, for instance, or the spouses of top officials. Marcos vowed “accountability and transparency in everything that we do,” when pressed by CNN Philippines’ Rico Hizon on the release of details about his trips. But the President disagreed with the TV anchor, who said it was hard to invite investors if “there’s a lack of transparency, accountability.” “This has not been an issue that the private businesses bring up. They bring up ease of doing business. They bring up the cost of energy. They bring up the problems of legislative guarantees,” said Marcos. He added: “So the critics will have their say. But those who are actually contemplating putting good money into the Philippines have other issues and that is not… accountability and transparency is not an issue.” The Palace has yet to release expense reports on Marcos’ visits. It has also not officially made delegation lists public, despite repeated requests from the media. In all of Marcos’ visits around the world, both he and the Palace have highlighted the importance of selling the Philippines to the world, particularly in the economic aftermath of COVID-19. Marcos himself said the results won’t be instant. “Proseso ‘yan….Pagka hindi tayo bumiyahe at nagpakita diyan sa mga conference na ‘yan, hindi tayo iniisip. Wala sa isip nila ang Pilipinas (It’s a process. If we do not travel and attend those conferences, we won’t be top of mind. The Philippines won’t even be considered),” he said. But the President said part of it is also about introducing himself. “I’m the new kid on the block. Nobody knows who I am. Kailangan kong magpakilala (I need to introduce myself),” said Marcos, whose father was president and later, dictator, for over two decades. “That’s important also na magkaroon ng personal, halimbawa personal sa mga lider na kaya ko ngayon – hindi ko kayang gawin ‘yun dati. Ngayon kaya kong buhatin ang telepono, tumawag diyan sa lahat, tatanggapin naman ang tawag ko at mayroon na kaming mapapag-usapan, and that’s very, very important,” he added. (It’s important for leaders to have personal connections. I wasn’t able to do that before. Now I can pick up the phone, call them and expect them to answer my call, talk about these issues and that’s very, very important.) Former socioeconomic planning secretary Solita “Winnie” Monsod shared her assessment of Marcos’ Davos trip in her January 23 blog. “Generally, a cost-benefit analysis is done before an activity is undertaken, and only if the perceived benefits exceed the costs of the activity will it be undertaken. Obviously this was not done with respect to the President’s Davos trip. If this is an indication of how decisions are made by the President, it does not augur very well for the country,” Monsod said. Monsod said that one of the goals of the WEF trip was for the soft launch of the proposed Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF). Judging by the video footage of this event, she said, there were only “13 anonymous people out of a possible 2,500 WEF participants” who showed interest by attending the soft launch. “What does that say about the success of the President’s ‘soft launch'”? she asked. She also said that based on a “very understated cost of travel, food and accommodations,” the Swiss trip bill would “come up to P65.35 million.” “A trip costing at least P65 million results in expressions of interest about the MIF/SWF from, at most, 13 nameless attendees of the WEF, if we assume that all who attended the country dialogue were impressed,” she said. The President had said in his January 21 arrival statement that he did not only pitch the proposal, he also sought advice from “friends and partners in Davos” on how best to package the country’s planned sovereign wealth fund. Economist JC Punongbayan had also summed up Marcos’ participation at the WEF in Davos as marked by “economic lies and cherry-picking galore.” – Rappler.com"

The designer looked beyond Baker’s stage style, also considering her love of suits and the uniforms she wore as a member of the resistance in France during the Second World War, as well as more intimate garments, including body-enveloping robes worn after a performance. The show of the LVMH-owned label opened with a luxurious robe-like coat, thrown over a satin bodysuit. A black velvet jumpsuit followed, strapless, the legs cut wide, before moving into a series of enveloping coats worn on top of long, pleated skirts. Artwork by Mickalene Thomas lined the set, larger-than-life portraits of Black women, including Donyale Luna, Eartha Kitt, and Naomi Sims who built on the path opened up by Baker, said Thomas. She sought to depict the beauty and confidence of these women, Thomas told Reuters, describing the challenge of whittling the list down to 13. “All of these women were socially active and either they used their stage, their voice or their performance to really tell a story or a narrative about their personal life and about also the demographic that they were from,” said Thomas. The exhibit, which is set up in a temporary show space at the Rodin Museum in Paris is open to the public through January 29. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/death-toll-filipino-confirmed-killed-massacre-monterey-park-california-january-23-2023/,[],"CALIFORNIA, USA – The Los Angeles county coroner’s office on Monday began identifying the 11 people killed in the Lunar New Year massacre inside a popular dance parlor in Monterey Park, California. Ten victims died at the scene of the Saturday shooting. Authorities on Monday said an 11th person, a woman in her 70s, died while being treated at a local hospital. The coroner’s office confirmed the names of four victims. Three women – My Nhan, 65, Lilan Li, 63, and Xiujuan Yu, 57 – were among the patrons who died in Saturday’s shooting at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio. The fourth named victim was Valentino Alvero, 68. Philippine Deputy Consul General Ambrosio Enciso earlier confirmed in an interview with Philippine radio station DZBB on Tuesday, January 24, that a Filipino – Alvero – was among those killed in the shooting. He said that the consulate was “trying to reach out to the family.” “I’m sure they are in shock and mourning,” Enciso said. While not releasing the other victims’ names, the coroner’s office said the six women and five men who were killed were all in their 50, 60s, and 70s. The 11th victim died on Monday, January 23, from injuries suffered in the weekend shooting rampage at a Los Angeles-area dance hall, as investigators searched for a motive behind one of California’s bloodiest outbursts of mass gun violence. Ten victims died at the scene of the Saturday shooting. Authorities on Monday said an 11th person, a woman in her 70s, died while being treated at a local hospital. Even as Los Angeles-area police worked through second full day of their investigation, seven people were reported slain in a separate, mass shooting in the northern California coastal town of Half Moon Bay on Monday. Nhan’s family said in a written statement released on Twitter that “we are starting the Lunar New Year broken.” They said Nhan, whom they remembered for her warm smile and kindness, had visited the dance studio on weekends for many years. “It’s what she loved to do,” they said. “But unfairly, Saturday was her last dance.” Friends and frequenters of the ballroom identified another victim as Ming Wei Ma, believed to be in his 60s. He was a frequent presence at the dance studio, and friends told a CBS affiliate that he was among the first to rush the shooter. “He was just caring, an ‘others first, people first’ kind of person,” Ma’s friend Eric Chen told local media. Lauren Woods, a tango dance instructor at the ballroom, said Ma was “the heart” of the studio. Woods wrote on her Facebook profile that Ma would greet her with a kiss on the cheek and say “My teacher! My teacher!” and “Love you! Love you!” Dariusz Michalski, another dance instructor at the ballroom, took to social media to express sympathy for all the victims and their families. He had especially kind words for Ma, whose “love, joy for people will never be forgotten.” Over a photo of Michalski and Ma embracing as the pair celebrated the dance instructor’s 50th birthday at a party inside the studio last June, Michalski wrote of Ma: “Your dance and singing passion will never disappear. You will be greatly missed. I love you my friend.” Other victims’ identifications were withheld pending notification of next of kin. The coroner’s office said one woman who died was in her 50s and two other women, in addition to the ones identified, were in their 60s. Three men killed were in their 70s and two were in their 60s. The Chinese consulate in Los Angeles said in a statement that Chinese citizens were among those killed but did not offer further details about the victims. Acting Chinese Counsul General Shi Yuanqiang met with Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna and expressed his wish to work closely together, according to a tweet from the sheriff’s department. Police identified Huu Can Tran, 72 as the lone suspect in a massacre that unfolded Saturday night in the midst of a Lunar New Year celebration Monterey Park, just east of Los Angeles. He drove to another dance hall where a second attack was thwarted, and later killed himself as police closed in to make an arrest hours after the shooting. Tran opened fire at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a venue popular with older patrons of Asian descent. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said investigators recovered 42 shell casings from the studio and a large-capacity ammunition magazine. He said the search of the suspect’s mobile home in a gated senior-living community in the town of Hemet, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, turned up a rifle, various electronic devices and items “that lead us to believe the suspect was manufacturing homemade” weapons silencers. Police also seized hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the dwelling, Luna said. According to police, Tran barged into another dance hall about 20 minutes later in the neighboring community of Alhambra, where he was disarmed by an employee and fled that scene, triggering an overnight manhunt. Luna credited the owner of the dance hall with disarming the would-be shooter. The search for the gunman ended on Sunday morning when the suspect shot himself as police officer surrounded his cargo van in a parking lot in Torrance, south of Los Angeles. Authorities on Sunday said a motive for the shooting remained to be determined. On Sunday, Luna said “everything is on the table” in terms of identifying the reasons for the shooting. Officers in Hemet, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, were assisting the county Sheriff’s Department in a search of Tran’s mobile home in a gated senior living community, said Alan Reyes, spokesperson for the Hemet Police Department. Luna told a news briefing on Monday that Tran had a “limited” past criminal history, including a 1990 arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm. Hemet police said in a statement on Monday that Tran had come to the department twice in early January alleging “past fraud, theft and poisoning allegations involving his family” dating back 10 to 20 years. Tran had said he would return with documentation regarding his claims but never did, the police statement said. Tran had an active trucking license and had owned a company called Tran’s Trucking Inc with a post office box address in Monterey Park, according to online records. He had lived in the Los Angeles area since at least the 1990s and moved to the mobile home in Hemet in 2020, address records showed. A neighbor in his gated community described him as “meek” in an interview Monday. But Adam Hood, a longtime tenant of the alleged gunman at a property in the Los Angeles area, told Reuters he had known Tran to be an aggressive and suspicious person with few friends. Tran had liked ballroom dancing, largely his only social activity, Hood said. Hood said Tran complained that people at the Star Ballroom studio were talking behind his back. “He was a good dancer in my opinion,” Hood said. “But he was distrustful of the people at the studio, angry and distrustful. I think he just had enough.” Luna praised the “heroic” actions of Brandon Tsay, the man who operates the family-run Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio dance club, where the gunman apparently sought to carry out a second attack. The sheriff credited Tsay with single-handedly wrestling away a semi-automatic assault-style pistol from the suspect before the gunman could get off a shot. “That moment, it was primal instinct,” Tsay told the New York Times, saying that the gunman fled the scene after a 90-second struggle. “Something happened there. I don’t know what came over me.” About 12 hours later, police officers in Torrance, 20 miles southwest of Monterey Park, cornered a white cargo van that Tran was driving. As officers neared the van, they heard a single gun shot from inside as Tran killed himself. Luna said the pistol that Tran used was likely illegal in California, having a magazine whose capacity exceeded the state limit of 10 rounds. The shooting took place during a two-day Chinese Lunar New Year celebration in Monterey Park, which draws thousands of people from across Southern California. As news about the shooting spread, some in the tight-knit community of Monterey Park initially feared it was a hate crime targeting Asians. The city of 60,000 people has for decades been a destination for immigrants from China. Around 65% of its residents are Asian, according to U.S. Census data. Residents describe it as a friendly community where such a tragedy was previously unthinkable. At the entrance to the Star Ballroom dance studio on Monday, residents left flowers, fruit and candles to honor the dead. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-wants-erwin-tulfo-stay-administration/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Nearly a month after Erwin Tulfo’s unexplained exit from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday, January 23, that he hopes to keep the broadcaster in his administration. In late December, the Palace’s messaging arm announced that Undersecretary Edu Punay would take over as Office-in-Charge of the department, without explaining where Tulfo was heading. Queries from the media then were also left unanswered. This was the first time for Marcos to talk about Tulfo’s situation after his sudden exit, which came after he failed to hurdle the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA). It was his second time to be bypassed by the CA – the first, because there was not enough time. Back then, most of the Cabinet had been left unconfirmed by the time session was suspended, so they were considered bypassed and the President had to reappoint them. But the second CA bypass came after he admitted in a public hearing that while in the US, he was “working with the US Department of Defense.” He was asked to confirm if he renounced his Philippine citizenship when he served in the US Army from 1988 to 1992. Tulfo did not answer the question directly and asked for an executive or closed-door session. CA members also quized Tulfo over his libel case, and later decided to defer his appointment. “Whatever we say… difficulties that he faced with the Committee on Appointments, in the CA, he – the time that he was running the DSWD, he did a very good job. So, we can’t lose that kind of… that kind of asset. So, we’ll find something that he can do so we could take advantage of his good instincts when it comes to social service,” said Marcos, when asked if Tulfo would stay in his administration. The President also clarified that Tulfo would not be appointed a presidential adviser, contrary to rumors. He has yet to name a full-time replacement for Tulfo in the DSWD. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/oath-keepers-guilty-seditious-conspiracy-united-states-capitol-attack/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Four more members of the far-right Oath Keepers were found guilty on Monday, January 23, of seditious conspiracy for taking part in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump, in another big win for federal prosecutors. The verdict marks the end of the second major sedition trial against members of the extremist group, who were among the hundreds who attacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over Trump, a Republican, in the 2020 presidential election. The 12-member jury found Oath Keeper members David Moerschel, Joseph Hackett, Roberto Minuta and Edward Vallejo guilty of seditious conspiracy. All four were also found guilty of obstructing Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election, and for two other conspiracy charges in connection with the Capitol attack. Seditious conspiracy is a rarely prosecuted Civil War-era law that prohibits plotting to overthrow or destroy the government and carries up to 20 years in prison. A jury found Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and another Florida-based leader of the group guilty of seditious conspiracy in a separate trial in November. Three other members in that trial were found not guilty of that charge, but all five defendants were found guilty of obstructing Congress from certifying the election. Prosecutors have brought criminal charges against more than 950 people following the riot. Four people died during the chaos, and five police officers died of various causes after the attack. US District Judge Amit Mehta split the Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy case into two separate trials due to space limitations and the risks of COVID-19 contagion. In both trials, Rhodes’ fiery rhetoric and inflammatory statements about “civil war” and “bloody war” took center stage, with prosecutors saying the other members were inspired to carry out his vision. A third seditious conspiracy trial against five members of the Proud Boys, another right-wing militant group, is ongoing. Jurors heard testimony and evidence in the second Oath Keepers case for several weeks. None of the four defendants played major leadership roles in the organization, and their attorneys have said there is no evidence they plotted to block certification of the election. On the day of the attack, Moerschel, Hackett and Minuta all entered the Capitol clad in tactical gear. Prosecutors said Minuta led a group of several Oath Keepers into the Capitol and clashed violently with police, all the while screaming it was “their building.” Scott Weinberg, an attorney for Moerschel, told reporters he believes it may have been easier for the defendants if they had been tried in the same trial with Rhodes because it would have been easier to point to him as the “real bad guy.” “Obviously, these men were swept up by the Stop the Steal nonsense that was pushed by the president,” Weinberg added. “When you follow somebody blindly, you end up in a terrible situation.” Though all four defendants were found guilty of the most serious charges they faced, some were acquitted on others. Jurors convicted Hackett of tampering with evidence, but acquitted him of destruction of federal property. Moerschel was acquitted on both charges, while Minuta was acquitted of tampering. Vallejo was not charged with tampering or federal property destruction. He was accused of staying back at a hotel in Northern Virginia, where the Oath Keepers staged a “quick reaction force” that prosecutors said was equipped with firearms ready to be quickly transported into Washington. All four men will be required to remain in home detention pending sentencing. Some are expected to appeal the verdict. The trial featured testimony from law enforcement officials and several fellow Oath Keepers who had previously pleaded guilty to other crimes, who said they had acted to stop the vote count. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/live-nation-defends-ticketmaster-blames-bots-taylor-swift-concert-debacle/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA –  Ticketmaster learned “valuable lessons” when the Taylor Swift concert tickets sale last year was disrupted by record bot traffic, the parent company will tell a US Senate committee on Tuesday, January 24. “In hindsight there are several things we could have done better – including staggering the sales over a longer period of time and doing a better job setting fan expectations for getting tickets,” Live Nation Entertainment President and Chief Financial Officer Joe Berchtold said in written testimony released by the company ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. Ticketmaster has come under harsh criticism from fans and lawmakers, accusing it of having too much control over the market for concert tickets. “The high fees, site disruptions and cancellations that customers experienced shows how Ticketmaster’s dominant market position means the company does not face any pressure to continually innovate and improve,” Senator Amy Klobuchar said. In November, Ticketmaster was deluged with more than 3.5 billion requests from fans, bots and scalpers that overwhelmed its website, and the company canceled a planned ticket sale to the general public for Swift’s Eras tour, her first in five years. At the time, Swift said it was “excruciating” for her to watch fans struggle to secure tickets and that she had been assured that Ticketmaster could handle large demand. Swift said she was “not going to make excuses for anyone” because her team had been assured multiple times by ticket sellers that they could handle a surge in demand. Ticketmaster said more than 2 million “presale” tickets were sold for Swift’s tour, a single-day record for an artist. Berchtold’s testimony said Live Nation has invested over $1 billion over the years to improve Ticketmaster. “We also need to recognize how industrial scalpers breaking the law using bots and cyberattacks to try to unfairly gain tickets contributes to an awful consumer experience,” Berchtold said, calling on Congress to adopt reforms. Witnesses at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled “That’s The Ticket: Promoting Competition and Protecting Consumers in Live Entertainment” will also include top executives from SeatGeek Inc and Jam Productions LLC and Ticketmaster critic Clyde Lawrence, a singer-songwriter in the band Lawrence. “As Live Nation leverages its power across the concert ecosystem to increase its profits, concertgoers see higher prices, and artists experience challenging touring dynamics,” Lawrence wrote in a New York Times essay last month. “Whether it meets the legal definition of a monopoly or not, Live Nation’s control of the live music ecosystem is staggering.” Ticketmaster has denied any anti-competitive practices and remains under a consent decree with the Justice Department following its 2010 merger with Live Nation. Berchtold said the “US ticketing markets have never been more competitive than they are today,” citing the emergence of the enormous secondary ticketing market and new primary competitors like SeatGeek. Live Nation included letters of support with its testimony including one from singer Garth Brooks who asked” My question is, as a country, why don’t we just make scalping illegal? The crush of bots during an on-sale is a huge reason for program failure.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/rust-completed-with-alec-baldwin-lead-role-lawyer-says/,[],"Western movie Rust will continue filming with Alec Baldwin in the lead role, a lawyer for the production said Monday, January 23, days after prosecutors said they would charge the actor in the fatal shooting of the movie’s cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin will continue to play grandfather Harland Rust while Joel Souza will return as Rust director following his wounding in the October 2021 shooting, said Melina Spadone, an attorney for Rust Movie Productions. The late cinematographer’s husband Matt Hutchins remains executive producer, she said. “The film is still on track to be completed,” Spadone said in a statement. Hutchins died on a film set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when a revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with fired a live bullet that also hit Souza. Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies on Thursday, January 19, said she planned to charge both Baldwin and the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with Hutchins’ death. Baldwin in October reached a settlement of a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the Hutchins family under which Hutchins would take a production role in Rust and filming would resume this month. Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting, saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety. An investigation by Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office has yet to reveal how live rounds got onto the production. Legal analysts said prosecutors face an uphill battle convicting Baldwin of criminal charges without proof he knew live ammunition was present and took no precautions. Some suspect they are seeking a plea deal with the Emmy-winning 30 Rock and movie star. “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of evidence that people were acting in a way that they were actually aware of what the danger was, and acting with disregard for the danger.” said Kate Mangels, an attorney with entertainment law firm Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Holley. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/ex-fbi-official-charles-mcgonigal-worked-sanctioned-russian-oligarch-prosecutors/,[],"NEW YORK, USA – A former top FBI official was charged on Monday, January 23, with working for sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, as US prosecutors ramp up efforts to enforce sanctions on Russian officials and police their alleged enablers. Charles McGonigal, who led the FBI’s counterintelligence division in New York before retiring in 2018, pleaded not guilty to four criminal counts including sanctions violations and money laundering at a hearing in Manhattan federal court. He was released on $500,000 bond, following his arrest over the weekend. Prosecutors said McGonigal, 54, in 2021 received concealed payments from Deripaska, who was sanctioned in 2018, in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch. McGonigal was also charged with unsuccessfully pushing in 2019 to lift sanctions against Deripaska. Sanctions “must be enforced equally against all US citizens in order to be successful,” FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael Driscoll said in a statement. “There are no exceptions for anyone, including a former FBI official.” Separately on Monday, federal prosecutors in Washington said McGonigal received $225,000 in cash from a former member of Albania’s intelligence service, who had been a source in an investigation into foreign political lobbying that McGonigal was supervising. McGonigal faces nine counts in that case, including making false statements to conceal from the FBI the nature of his relationship with the person. “This is obviously a distressing day for Mr McGonigal and his family,” the defendant’s lawyer Seth DuCharme told reporters after the Manhattan hearing. “We’ll review the evidence, we’ll closely scrutinize it, and we have a lot of confidence in Mr McGonigal.” Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum company Rusal, was among two dozen Russian oligarchs and government officials blacklisted by Washington in 2018 in reaction to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 US election. He and the Kremlin have denied any election interference. Also charged in the Manhattan case was Sergey Shestakov, a former Soviet diplomat who later became an American citizen and Russian language interpreter for U.S. courts and government agencies. Prosecutors said Shestakov he worked with McGonigal to help Deripaska, and made false statements to investigators. Shestakov pleaded not guilty on Monday and was released on $200,000 bond. The enforcement of sanctions are part of U.S. efforts to pressure Moscow to stop its war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a “special military operation.” Deripaska was charged last September with violating the sanctions against him by arranging to have his children born in the United States. The following month, British businessman Graham Bonham-Carter was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions by trying to move Deripaska’s artwork out of the United States. Deripaska is at large, and Bonham-Carter is contesting extradition to the United States. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-24-2023/,[],"KYIV, Ukraine – Several senior Ukrainian officials resigned on Tuesday, January 24, in the biggest leadership shakeup of the war with Russia so far, in what an aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an answer to public calls for “justice”. Some, though not all, of the resignations were linked with corruption allegations. Ukraine has a history of graft and shaky governance, and is under international pressure to show it can be a reliable steward of billions of dollars in Western aid. “There are already personnel decisions – some today, some tomorrow – regarding officials at various levels in ministries and other central government structures, as well as in the regions and in law enforcement,” Zelenskiy said in an overnight video address. Zelenskiy aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted: “The president sees and hears society. And he directly responds to a key public demand – justice for all.” Among those stepping down or fired on Tuesday morning were a deputy prosecutor general, a deputy defense minister and the deputy chief of staff in Zelenskiy’s own office. The changes came two days after a deputy infrastructure minister was arrested and accused of siphoning off $400,000 from contracts to buy generators, one of the first big corruption scandals to become public since the war began 11 months ago. The Defense Ministry said Deputy Defense Minister Vyacheslav Shapovalov, responsible for supplying troops, had resigned on Tuesday morning as a “worthy deed” to retain trust, after media accusations of corruption which he and the ministry rejected. It followed a newspaper report that the ministry overpaid for food for troops, which the ministry and its supplier both denied. The prosecutor’s office announced that Deputy Prosecutor General Oleksiy Symonenko had been removed from office, giving no reason. Symonenko had been under fire in Ukrainian media for taking a holiday in Spain. Though Zelenskiy did not name any officials in his address, he announced a ban on officials taking holidays abroad. “Ignoring the war is a luxury no one can afford,” he said. “If they want to rest, they will rest outside the civil service.” Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of staff in Zelenskiy’s office, announced his own resignation, also citing no reason. He had helped run the president’s 2019 election campaign and more recently had a role in overseeing regional policy. The changes are a rare shakeup of an otherwise notably stable wartime leadership in Kyiv. Apart from purging a spy agency in July, Zelenskiy has mostly stuck with his team, built around fellow political novices the former television actor brought into power when he was elected in a landslide in 2019 promising to root out a corrupt political class. Kyiv says a surge in patriotic feeling has dampened corruption since Russia’s invasion. But the head of Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People party promised on Monday that officials would be arrested in a coming anti-corruption drive, which would resort to martial law if necessary. Front lines in the war have been largely frozen in place for two months despite heavy losses on both sides. Western countries pledged billions of dollars in military aid last week, but have yet to respond to Kyiv’s request for hundreds of heavy battle tanks, which it says it needs to break through Russian lines and recover occupied territory. Most defense experts say the most suitable tanks available in sufficient numbers are German-made Leopards. But Berlin has so far held back from sending them, or from committing to let allies such as Poland send them. Germany was not blocking the re-export of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, the European Union’s top diplomat said on Monday. Ukraine and Russia are both widely believed to be planning spring offensives to break the deadlock in what has become a war of attrition in eastern and southern Ukraine. “If the major Russian offensive planned for this time fails, it will be the ruin of Russia and Putin,” Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said in an interview with news site Delfi. Meanwhile, Russian forces pounded Donetsk in Ukraine’s east. Ukrainian forces repelled 11 attacks, 10 of them in the Donetsk region, including in the areas of the town of Bakhmut and the village of Klishchiivka to the south, Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday. Last week, Russia said it had captured Klishchiivka. Russian forces have been pressing for months for control of Bakhmut but with limited success. Reuters could not verify battlefield reports. Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year and flattened cities, killing thousands of civilians. Kyiv repelled an initial assault on the capital, recaptured territory in the second half of 2022 and says it aims to drive all Russian troops out. Moscow claimed last year to have annexed four partially occupied Ukrainian provinces, in addition to Crimea which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow put the chief of its military general staff, Valery Gerasimov, in direct command of the war this month in at least the third shakeup of overall leadership since the invasion. In his first interview since taking command of the battlefield, Gerasimov stuck to Moscow’s line that its “special military operation” is a form of defense against a threat from the West. “Our country and its armed forces are today acting against the entire collective West,” he told the news website Argumenty i Fakty. – Rappler.com"

The Serbian fourth seed, who sustained the injury en route to the Adelaide International 1 title earlier this month and has been managing the problem, mowed down Australian Alex de Minaur, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, to reach the quarterfinals. “A week ago, I didn’t really think about the title, I just thought about being in a good enough condition to play the next match.

But the way my leg felt before tonight wasn’t giving me too many hopes, so to say, for the entire tournament, to go all the way through.” Djokovic looked hampered by the problem in previous matches and described Monday’s win over De Minaur as his best match of the year but he conceded later that it had been tiring to get himself ready for matches. “We take it day by day. We do a lot of things actually. It’s been exhausting to be involved in a lot of different treatments and machines and stuff that we do,” Djokovic told reporters. “At the same time it was necessary… in order to get myself in a condition to play. So I’m really glad my body has responded really well.” “Tonight I didn’t feel any pain. I moved as well as I have the whole tournament. It means we’re progressing in the right direction.” Djokovic said he would not celebrate too early as he did not know how his body would respond for his next encounter, against Russian Andrey Rublev. He explained that his injury meant certain movement had been affected in his previous matches. “Particularly the extreme movements on the court, change of directions, and so forth. Maybe people who were watching me play don’t maybe get that idea. For me as a player, being on the court, I can feel the difference,” Djokovic said. “I guess you have to accept and deal with the fact that you have a certain amount of the pain, which isn’t an issue for me. The biggest issue was the unpredictability of what the next quick move can cause.” “That’s what was my biggest concern because that’s how I got injured actually before the tournament started. So those quick change of directions and movements have been in the first couple of matches tough for me. But tonight, no problem at all.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/germany-labor-union-vows-fight-ford-job-cuts-europe/,[],"BERLIN, Germany – Ford Motor Company plans to cut up to 3,200 jobs across Europe and move some product development work to the United States, Germany’s IG Metall union said on Monday, January 23, vowing action that would disrupt the carmaker across the continent if the cuts go ahead. Rising costs for electric vehicle battery materials and projected slowdowns in US and European economies are putting pressure on automakers to cut expenses. The EV price war launched by Tesla earlier this month has intensified that pressure, analysts said. The company wants to axe up to 2,500 jobs in product development and up to 700 in administrative roles, with German locations most affected, IG Metall said. Workers at the US carmaker’s Cologne site, which employs about 14,000 people – including 3,800 at a development center in the Merkenich area – were informed of the plans at works council meetings on Monday. Ford’s spokesperson in Germany declined to comment, referring to a statement on Friday, January 20, in which it said that the shift to production of EVs requires structural changes and it would not say more until plans are finalized. A spokesperson at the automaker’s headquarters in Michigan said discussions with the German works councils were continuing and that the company needs to be “more competitive” as it transitions to EVs. He would not comment on specific job plans. Ford last year announced a $2-billion investment to expand production at its Cologne plant to make an all-electric model for the mass market. The plant currently produces the Ford Fiesta as well as engines and transmissions. The carmaker, which employs about 45,000 people in Europe, is planning seven new electric models in the region, a battery assembly site in Germany, and a nickel cell manufacturing joint venture in Turkey as part of a major EV push on the continent. It also has a partnership with Volkswagen to produce 1.2 million vehicles on the German carmaker’s MEB electric platform over six years. That partnership remains in place, Ford and Volkswagen representatives said, though Ford’s US spokesperson added that Volkswagen’s role in Ford’s next generation of European electric vehicles was still to be determined. However, it warned last June of “significant” job cuts in the near term at its factory in Spain and its plant in Saarlouis, Germany, as the shift to EV production meant it would require fewer labor hours to assemble cars. Ford’s pretax profit margins in Europe were 2.2% of sales for the first nine months of 2022, well below levels in North America. It also warned in October of weakening economic conditions in Europe. “If negotiations between the works council and management in coming weeks do not ensure the future of workers, we will join the process,” IG Metall said. “We will not hold back from measures that could seriously impact the company, not just in Germany but Europe-wide.” Ford shares were up 3.9% at $12.89 on Monday afternoon in New York. Shares of rival General Motors Company gained 3.1% to $36.45, while Tesla stock was up 7.6% at $143.60. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/britain-national-farmers-union-statement-tesco-inflation-january-2023/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Britain’s farming union has accused the boss of Tesco, the country’s biggest supermarket, of living in a “parallel universe” after he said food companies may be using inflation as an excuse to hike prices more than necessary. While supermarket chains look to hold down prices to preserve market share, food companies and farmers are facing surging costs they need to pass on through higher prices. Official inflation data for December published last week showed food prices 16.8% higher than a year earlier, the sharpest increase since September 1977, led by eggs, milk, and cheese. Asked by BBC television on Sunday, January 22, if food producers were taking advantage of the poorest in society, Tesco chairman John Allan said it was “entirely possible.” He said the retailer, which has a 27.5% share of Britain’s grocery market, was trying “very hard” to challenge price hikes it thinks are illegitimate and had “fallen out” with “a number of suppliers.” Minette Batters, president of Britain’s National Farmers’ Union, said she was “slightly baffled” by Allan’s comments. “It was almost like he was living in a parallel universe,” she told BBC radio on Monday, January 23, noting farmers and growers were facing unprecedented hikes in production costs. “We’re seeing a wholesale gas price that’s 650% higher than it was back in 2019 and the cost inflation on the back of that has been unprecedented and it has dwarfed any price increases to date,” she said. Allan said there had been “very robust discussions” between Tesco and a number of suppliers, and referenced last year’s spat with US food giant Kraft Heinz. “We didn’t have Heinz soup and Heinz tomato ketchup for a spell last summer when they tried to put through a large price increase at that stage. That was eventually settled,” he said. “We’ve fallen out with other suppliers. So we do try very hard I think to challenge cost increases.” Tesco also had a pricing dispute with Mars last year. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said producers’ prices were inevitably impacted by rises in the cost of energy, ingredients, transport, packaging, and labor. “If they can’t pass some of these cost increases on, they’ll go out of business,” Betts told BBC Radio, noting that most supermarkets are asking suppliers to open their books to justify “line by line” where the cost increases are coming in. While inflation has added tension to negotiations, Tesco’s supplier relationships have been transformed since a 2014 accounting scandal, with the independently run supplier Advantage Report often ranking it as the best supermarket group to deal with. This month, when Tesco reported better-than-expected Christmas trading, chief executive officer Ken Murphy said the group had raised prices less than the overall market. “We are battling [with suppliers] to keep prices down for customers and it’s an ongoing struggle but we’re doing our best,” he told reporters. “It is a constant to and fro but there’s a fair bit of partnership involved as well,” he said, pointing to its “price lock” scheme that will maintain prices on over 1,000 branded and own-brand products until Easter. “Our suppliers recognize that they also need to protect volume…they want to protect their market share, they want to work with us to do so,” he said. Murphy said Tesco was in a constant dialogue with suppliers. “We’re just trying to make sure that only the justifiable price increases come through and that everything else is mitigated or held back.” Shares in Tesco were up 0.2% in early afternoon trading, paring losses over the last year to 14%. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-23-2023/,[],"Poland’s prime minister said on Monday, January 23, his government would ask Germany for permission to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine – and planned to send them whether or not Berlin agreed. The Kyiv government wants the German-made Leopard 2 tank to break through Russian lines and recapture territory this year. Pressure on Berlin – which must approve re-exports of the Leopard – also came from EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels. Latvia’s foreign minister said “there are no good arguments” why the battle tanks could not be provided. The issue has dominated recent discussions among Western allies about how much and what sort of material aid they should give Ukraine as the first anniversary of the Russian invasion nears. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, whose country neighbors Ukraine, said on Monday Warsaw would ask Germany for permission to re-export tanks to Ukraine. But he added: “Even if we did not get this approval… we would still transfer our tanks together with others to Ukraine. The condition for us at the moment is to build at least a small coalition of countries.” Germany’s foreign minister appeared to hold the door open to approval of such shipments on Sunday when she said Berlin would not stand in the way if Poland wanted to send them. Ukraine and Russia are both believed to be planning spring offensives to break deadlock in what has become a war of attrition in eastern and southern Ukraine. Current fighting is centerd on the town of Bakhmut in the east, where Russia’s Wagner mercenaries and Ukrainian forces have been locked in battle. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meanwhile was grappling with a corruption scandal which could dampen Western enthusiasm for his government. A newspaper reported that the Ukrainian military had allegedly secured food at highly inflated prices, and a deputy minister resigned after an investigation into allegations he accepted a bribe. Ukrainian officials have been pleading with Western allies to supply them with Leopard tanks for months. Germany has so far held back from sending them and says other NATO countries have yet to formally ask to re-export them. After Ukrainian advances in the second half of 2022, frontlines have been largely frozen in place for two months, despite heavy losses on both sides. Ukraine says Western tanks would give its ground troops the mobility, protection, and firepower to break through Russian defensive lines and resume their advance. “We need tanks – not 10-20, but several hundred,” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak wrote on Monday on Telegram. “Our goal is (restoring) the borders of 1991 and punishing the enemy, who will pay for their crimes.” Western allies pledged billions of dollars in weapons for Ukraine last week but failed to persuade Germany to commit to allowing Leopards. In an apparent shift in Germany’s position, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said on Sunday her government would not block Poland if it tries to send its Leopards. Arriving in Brussels on Monday, Baerbock declined to elaborate on those comments or say if she had been speaking for the whole government. She said it was important to “do everything we can to defend Ukraine”. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrat party argues the West should avoid sudden moves that might escalate the war. But a number of allies reject that position, saying Russia is already fully committed to its assault on Ukraine. “At this point there are no good arguments why battle tanks cannot be provided,” Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said. “The argument of escalation does not work, because Russia continues escalating.” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the tanks should not be held up one more day, while Luxembourg’s Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Russia could win the war if Europeans “don’t help Ukraine with what they need now”. American lawmakers pushed their government on Sunday to export M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, saying even a symbolic number would help push European allies to do the same. Britain has said it will supply 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron said he did not rule out the possibility of sending Ukraine Leclerc tanks. Leopards are seen as the best option for Ukraine because they are more widely available than the British and French tanks, and use less fuel than the turbine-powered US Abrams. The Kremlin said on Monday the splits in Europe over whether to provide tanks to Kyiv showed there was increasing “nervousness” within the NATO military alliance. “But of course all countries which take part, directly or indirectly, in pumping weapons into Ukraine and in raising its technological level bear responsibility” for continuing the conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The EU foreign ministers meeting were also due to discuss more military aid for Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he hoped they would approve another 500 million euro ($545 million) tranche of support. Since its invasion on February 24, 2022, which it has cast as defending itself from an aggressive West, Russia has taken control of parts of Ukraine it says it will never return. Ukraine has said that restoring its territorial integrity is not open for negotiation. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/europe-corporate-earnings-season-test-market-optimism/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Europe’s upcoming corporate earnings season is likely to show whether the renewed optimism about the economy that has buoyed equities in recent weeks is grounded in reality. The pan-European STOXX index is up 6% since the start of the year, hitting its highest since April after better-than-expected economic data and improved German investor sentiment. The STOXX 600 index is on course for its best January since 2019. In a sign analysts were unprepared for such optimism, Citi’s economic surprise indicator for the eurozone jumped last week to its highest since July 2021. Recent signs inflation could be softening, improved supply chains, revised global growth forecasts, and the sudden easing of three years of COVID-19 restrictions in China have raised hopes the corporate downturn may not be as severe as feared just a few weeks ago. Falls in gas, oil, and other commodity prices over recent months have also eased some of the pressure on companies’ costs. But Europe Inc isn’t out of the woods yet. “Companies are telling us that it’s going to be harder to pass on rising costs to customers in 2023 as economic growth slows,” said Nigel Bolton, co-chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “We have already seen job cuts and a renewed focus on profitability in the technology sector, and we expect that theme to spread across sectors this year.” On Friday, January 20, Ericsson said it would reduce headcount as the Swedish telecom equipment maker aims to slash expenditure. Market expectations are already very low. Fourth-quarter earnings for STOXX 600 companies are forecast to have grown by 10.7% year-on-year, the slowest in two years, according to Refinitiv data. That’s half the level expected just two months ago. Excluding the energy sector, growth would be 4.5%. Revenue is tipped to rise 4%, the weakest since the first quarter of 2021. In updates so far, sales from Cartier jeweler Richemont and British luxury brand Burberry missed expectations. Europe’s largest meals delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com said orders declined over the quarter. BofA Global Research said 16 firms had already issued profit warnings for the fourth quarter, with economic weakness limiting consumer spending cited as the most frequent reason. That’s almost half its tally of 35 in the third quarter, which was the highest since the first three months of 2020, at the start of the pandemic. Refinitiv data shows Europe Inc falling into recession later in the year too. Companies are expected to report a decline in earnings for two consecutive quarters: a drop of as much as 6.8% in the second quarter and 8.8% in the third. Earnings are seen bouncing back to growth of 11.4% in the final quarter of the year. Bernstein Research said its nominal earnings per share growth forecast for Europe for 2023 is at its lowest ever, at 0.6%, while inflation-adjusted earnings are seen falling 5%, reflecting the expectations for a recession in the region. Burberry and Richemont provided some optimism, though, noting better sales in China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. For more clues on consumer demand, fashion retailer H&M, Primark’s owner Associated British Foods, and Europe’s largest company by market value, luxury group LVMH, are due to report earnings this week. Investors will be scouring for comments on China, where surging COVID cases have raised concerns about further disruption after the world’s No. 2 economy reopened. Wages are still a focus as a tight job market and strong growth in salaries add pressure on margins. “A big question is how the past year’s surge in prices will affect wages, potentially delivering a second round of cost rises for companies and creating further price pressures,” said Toby Gibb, global head of investment directing at Fidelity International. With expectations at rock bottom, investors may be prepared to ride out the corporate storm, though. “If rates volatility subsides, we think equities and cyclicals can cope with a mild profits recession in 2023,” said Barclays’ head of European equity strategy, Emmanuel Cau. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/james-yap-admits-rookie-jitters-return-rain-or-shine/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – It felt like a trip down memory lane for James Yap. Yap said he reminisced about his rookie year in the PBA as he returned to action after a yearlong sabbatical, scoring 14 points for Rain or Shine in a 105-87 loss to Meralco in the Governors’ Cup opener on Sunday, January 22. The 2004 second overall pick took a leave of absence to run for councilor of San Juan City, eventually securing a post in the 1st District. “I felt like I was a rookie,” said Yap in Filipino. “It was the same feeling I experienced in 2004, I was nervous and I didn’t know if I could do it.” Yap last played in September 2021 as he sat out the last three PBA conferences – a period that saw the Elasto Painters fail to reach the playoffs twice. But Yap hardly looked like he missed a beat despite his hiatus, erupting for 12 points in a seven-minute stretch in the second quarter, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer that knotted the score at 54-54 going into the break. “I didn’t expect that,” said the two-time league MVP of his scoring display. “What matters to me is once I enter the court, I’m ready.” Although the Bolts pulled away in the third quarter en route to the 18-point rout, Rain or Shine head coach Yeng Guiao said Yap provided a bright spot in the blowout loss. “I guess if there was a positive side to this loss, it was maybe James’ game. He was able to come back, and at least for those six or seven minutes, he was able to hit his stride,” said Guiao. “That is a good sign for us. That means we can have another guy coming off the bench who can score and be a threat.” Now one of the oldest players in the PBA at 40 years old, Yap said he is pleased with his performance. “I’m happy that I was able to perform well. The result just didn’t favor us, but I’m sure we will bounce back,” said Yap. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-only-consult-first-lady-legal-not-policy-matters/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, on Monday, January 23, said his wife, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, has no role in policy-making and is only consulted for “legal” matters. “The First Lady helps me in terms of the organization because she’s actually very, very good at that – organize which office, how the workflow goes, where the documents go through. She’s a well trained lawyer, she’s very good at that. That’s the extent of it, we don’t talk policy together,” Marcos said in a media panel interview on Monday, January 23. Araneta-Marcos earlier released a video saying she had no hand in the appointments in government. Asked if he consulted her on other things, Marcos took a long pause before adding: “Not political. Legal, oh yeah, I will ask her. Whenever there’s a legal question, I’m not a lawyer, so I need an expert opinion.” Marcos quickly added that it was not just his wife whom he consulted for legal issues. “I have the best legal representation of any president,” he added. The current Executive Secretary is former Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and the presidential chief legal counsel is former senator Juan Ponce Enrile. “Between all of these experts and legal luminaries, that’s the only time that the discussion may include Liza. But she doesn’t come to the office and sit with us, at all,” he added. There has been no First Lady in the Palace in over two decades. Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, had a partner and an ex-wife, of which neither assumed the role. The late Benigno Aquino III, meanwhile, was a bachelor. For Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, her husband was dubbed the First Gentleman. Marcos and Araneta-Marcos have three sons together, including Ilocos Norte, 1st District Representative Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, who is Senior Deputy Majority Leader in the House. Representative Marcos, although a newbie legislator, has been a fixture in his father’s many working, official, and state visits abroad. The President was asked if they were grooming his eldest son for the presidency. “Sandro? No, he’s not being… we’re not grooming him for anything. He is grooming himself. He is a… he has decided on this career in politics and he will handle it the way he does. There’s not some long-range plan that he’ll be president but no, there’s no… we don’t think in those… he has work in Ilocos Norte,” said the President. The image of a Marcos president with his son in tow is a familiar one. President Marcos himself was often seen beside his father and namesake, the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, during special occasions. Marcos, who had said his return to politics after exile was for the clan’s “survival,” added: “It’s not something that we plan. I think [Representative Marcos] has the same attitude as I do: I’ll work as hard as I can and take this as far as I can.”  – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/new-mongolian-law-social-media-threatens-free-speech/,['GEMMA B. MENDOZA'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Mongolian parliament passed a new law on Friday, January 20, supposedly to “protect human rights on social media,” but human rights groups say it threatens free speech and gives the state the ultimate power to regulate content on tech platforms. The law will take effect on February 1, 2023, unless Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh vetoes it. The law applies to communication related to the “protection of human rights and legitimate interests from violation of social networks, ensuring the implementation of laws and regulations on the provision of human rights, and public enlightenment.” It covers communications where three users or more communicate with each other. A copy of the law is currently inaccessible from the website of the Mongolian parliament. The web archive Wayback Machine, however, was able to archive a version of the bill as of January 19. The law gives broad powers to a “public relations unit” that will be created under Mongolia’s Public Center for Combating Cyber Attacks and Violations and be tasked to regulate social media content. The broad powers include processing requests regarding restricted content and delivering decisions, recommendations, and requirements to social media providers. The law lists various content violations such as the following: The law also empowers the Mongolian government to “reduce the distribution of content in violation and [to] partially or completely limit the communication network” in the event of public unrest. “They are saying they took six years to build this,” Duuya Baatar, who runs Nest Center for Journalism Innovation and Development NGO and the Mongolian Fact-checking Center, told Rappler. “We can see there is not enough research on this.” What critics find highly irregular is the haste with which the new law was passed – less than three days after it was first presented to the public. “This is unprecedented, even faster than the COVID law,” Baatar said. Submitted to parliament Wednesday afternoon, January 18, the bill was passed just a little over 48 hours later on January 20, at past 5 pm. Out of 52 members of parliament who were present at the closing session, 40 voted in favor of the proposed legislation. Baatar said the first inkling Mongolian journalists had of the proposed measure was on January 17, during a press conference organized by the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications. Baatar said, “They invited journalists saying that they are talking about legalizing protection of human rights and protecting people from becoming victims of sexual exploitation.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-naida-angping-appointment-france/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Why did his uncle’s long-time aide get a plum diplomatic post? Simple – she asked for it, according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “[Former Presidential Management Staff chief Naida Angping] came back and said, ‘Maybe I can just do something that I will be able to handle.’ I said, ‘What do you think?’ She said, ‘If you could appoint me to a diplomatic position,’” recalled Marcos in an panel interview with select media on Monday, January 23. The President was asked about Angping’s surprise appointment as ambassador to Paris, barely a month after she asked for “time off,” citing personal issues. Angping, a former legislator who represented Manila, was Marcos’ Presidential Management Staff chief from the time he assumed office until early January 2023, when she was nominated to the diplomatic post. Malacañang did not announce her appointment to France but silently submitted her nomination to the Commission on Appointments in mid-January 2023. Her exit came amid talk that her husband Harry, himself a former legislator, was caught harassing hotel staff in Bangkok where Marcos was attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. The Palace was silent about this reported incident, with only a senior official saying on background that Harry Angping was not arrested. It was no different with Naida Angping’s appointment as ambassador. Marcos defended Angping’s new post, citing her experience working as long-time aide to the President’s uncle Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, who was once Philippine ambassador to the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia. “She has not held formally a diplomatic position but she has been working with the foreign service for years and years and years,” said the President. Foreign service has apparently been a long-time dream of Angping, who Marcos said, was working on passing the notoriously rigorous Foreign Service Officer (FSO) test. “That’s what she’s always wanted to do since before. So now we’re going to formalize her wishes,” said Marcos, referring to Angping’s foreign service dreams. But the allegations against her husband were not the only rumors about Angping in the Palace. According to informed sources, there was discontent over her work ethic since she was said to be away from her office most of the time. Marcos distanced himself from any speculation over Angping’s personal issues, telling media: “The reasons for it are personal and I don’t think it’s my place to talk about it.” Angping’s appointment to Paris led to the displacement of Ambassador Junever Mahilum-West, a career diplomat who had only been appointed to the post in October 2021. The January 23 interview is the first time that Marcos spoke about Angping since her leave and since her appointment to Paris. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/janet-yellen-imf-visits-zambia-reflect-concern-stalled-debt-talks/,[],"LUSAKA, Zambia – Two of the world’s most powerful finance officials are visiting Zambia this week, a reflection of the growing concern shared by Western officials about how China and other creditors are handling the African country’s debt. Zambia requested debt relief under the Group of 20 Common Framework nearly two years ago, but progress has been glacial at best, despite increasingly urgent appeals to China and private sector creditors to reach a deal. Frustrated by the delays, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva arrived for separate visits in Zambia on Sunday, January 22. Both see a new sovereign debt roundtable – introduced late last year – as a way to make progress on long-stalled debt restructuring processes. While the overlap was coincidental, the two will meet informally while in Lusaka, a Treasury official said. Yellen told Reuters en route to Zambia she supported the roundtable as a forum for discussing general principles of debt relief. “I think that’s a helpful approach and hopefully the specific cases will be easier to deal with,” Yellen said. Georgieva and Yellen will both participate when the roundtable meets for the first time in India next month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance officials’ meeting. The specific date and guest list are still being worked out. Georgieva, who helped initiate the roundtable along with World Bank President David Malpass, told reporters this month it aimed to resolve broader issues such as transparency, timing of treatments, and how to set cutoff dates for loans, but was not intended to replace the existing Common Framework. “The roundtable is a good idea, but the expectations should be kept very modest,” Indermit Gill, World Bank chief economist, told Reuters. He said it could help build more trust among parties, especially Chinese officials, struggling to find a common approach among disparate lenders. Former senior Treasury official Mark Sobel said the roundtable could bring parties together for talks but it remained unclear if it would deliver results. “The leaders of the roundtable need to have a focused agenda with clear goals and timelines, build a collective spirit, and then keep the pressure on all parties to deliver results,” he said, adding the Common Framework had been “a flop” so far but remained the “the only game in town.” The world’s poorest countries faced $35 billion in debt-service payments to official and private-sector creditors in 2022, more than 40% of which is due to China, the World Bank found. This could rise to $69 billion by 2024 – the highest level in the current decade, a recent report projected. Yellen told reporters she had underscored the urgent need to cut debts of heavily indebted countries when she met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Zurich on Tuesday, January 17, warning failure to do so would set back development in poor countries and could lead to more war, fragility, and conflict. Restructuring Zambia’s debt was critically important, she said during a briefing in Lusaka. The delay in debt treatment is taking its toll on Zambia, according to the World Bank’s Gill: per capita income has slipped from middle-income to low-income status and about 60% of people now live in extreme poverty. “All the bad things that happen when a country declares default have happened to Zambia,” he said. Government data showed Zambia owed Chinese creditors nearly $6 billion of the total of $17 billion external debt at the end of 2021. Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema urged creditors on Monday, January 23, to quickly agree the content of a debt restructuring and warned if no conclusion was found soon it may distort economic recovery efforts. Gill sees parallels with the late 1970s, when the Federal Reserve raised rates to curb inflation, sending the US economy into the worst recession since the Great Depression during the early 1980s. High US interest rates ushered in what was labeled the “Lost Decade” in Latin America, landing many countries in default. “To some extent a similar thing could happen now,” Gill said. Yellen, however, noted rates were nowhere near those seen under Volcker and inflation was not out of control. “We’re in a higher interest rate environment, and that’s something that’s linked to the strong dollar, and weaker currencies for many emerging markets, but also Japan and other countries,” Yellen said. – Rappler.com"

Since then, and especially in January 2023, amid the rise in the cost of food, critics have been calling on Marcos to finally appoint someone who can hold the post full time. “For me there really are things that I can do that if there was a secretary and if he or she did it, magagawa pero matagal, maraming diskusyon (it’ll take long, there will be a lot of discussion)… the President, they cannot say no to,” he said in a panel interview with select media and TV personalities on Monday, January 23. As President, said Marcos, he can “chastize” or “move aside… push them into other positions” those who do not comply with his orders as agriculture chief. “Generally speaking, if the President asks you to do something, they’ll do it. If someone asks them to do it, they’ll probably do it or they may not,” he added. Both critics and allies – most notably, the President’s sister Senator Imee Marcos – have called on the President to finally pick a full-time agriculture chief. That sector isn’t the only one that has no full-time secretary. The Department of Health, as of January 2023, is headed by an officer-in-charge. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/india-few-jobs-meager-pay-urban-youth-despite-economic-growth/,[],"FARIDABAD, India – Ravi Verma, hired by an electrical parts manufacturing firm early last year as India’s economy surged, was fired in November when the company lost several export orders. He has since remained unemployed, unable to pay back a 100,000 rupee ($1,224) loan he took to buy a two-wheeler scooter. Verma is among thousands of Indian workers who lost jobs as the global slowdown hit exports, while the reentry of nearly 20 million workers into the job market after the pandemic has aggravated the problem. The rising unemployment in India belies other indicators suggesting the economy is undergoing a healthy rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the surge in people looking for work, many of them rural migrants, raises concerns about consumption and longer-term growth prospects. “I have been looking for a job for two months,” Verma said, looking up from a Hindi language newspaper he was reading at a community center close to his one-room home in the industrial town of Faridabad in northern India. “I face a risk of loan default if I don’t get a job soon.” The urban unemployment rate swelled to 10.1% in December, although the total number of jobs in India touched a pre-pandemic level of 410 million, data compiled by Mumbai-based think tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed. Urban unemployment spiked during the pandemic years, largely because of lockdowns, but before that it hovered between 6% and 7%, according to CMIE data. Previously, it reached a high of 11.2% in August 2016. “Nearly 37 million workers were looking for work in December,” said Mahesh Vyas, managing director of CMIE, citing a rebound in labor force participation rate driven by the return of women workers and rural youth joining the labor market as fears of the pandemic eased. That was the highest number of unemployed since June 2021 at the height of the pandemic, he added. Globally, India remains a “bright spot” amid growing fears of a recession in the United States and Europe, and the economy is projected to grow below 6% in the next financial year starting in April, down from estimated 7% growth in the current fiscal year. But hiring in export-dependent manufacturing sectors like engineering, textile, and software has slowed as companies face a decline in overseas demand – reflected in falling exports of manufactured goods, down 12.2% year-on-year in December. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, unemployment is emerging as a major challenge along with high inflation, and could prove costly in state elections later this year and a general election in mid-2024, analysts said. “The unemployment problem has become acute,” said Arun Kumar, an economist and a former professor at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. He said small businesses – which employ nearly 90% of workers – were shutting down and growth was being led by large companies and services. Hiring in IT, software, education, and retail fell up to 28% in December from a year ago, data compiled by Naukri.com, India’s biggest recruitment consultancy, showed, though it remained resilient in insurance, banking, and auto sectors. The online platform said it saw a near 14% rise in job applicants to around 7.6 million in 2022 from a year earlier. According to the latest government data, the number of workers joining firms with social security benefits fell for the third month in a row to 0.7 million in October, while the urban labor force participation rate rose to 47.9% in the September quarter, up 1% from a year earlier. Many young workers say they prefer to wait for skilled jobs they have been trained for, instead of accepting badly paid menial jobs on offer. This has pushed up unemployment in some states like Haryana, Rajasthan, and Bihar to record levels. In the northern state of Haryana – a manufacturing hub where global companies like Maruti Suzuki are located – the unemployment rate shot up to a historic high of 37.4% in December from around 20% before the pandemic. “I need at least a 20,000 rupees salary after three years of a course in electronics,” said Anjali Yadav, a female student at a polytechnic college in Faridabad, which is in Haryana. Factories and firms there were not ready to pay more than 10,000 to 12,000 rupees a month, said Mithlesh Kumar, a trade union leader. Another job seeker, Uttam Shaili, 22, said that after a two-year course studying to be an electronics mechanic he would prefer to “stay at home” than accept a low-paying job. Economists said the worsening employment scenario could affect consumer demand, drag private investments, and hurt growth prospects. “The loss of jobs in IT and some manufacturing sectors has hit consumer sentiment, and would hit household spending and business investments,” said Sunil Sinha, an economist at India Ratings, the Indian arm of Fitch Ratings agency. He said there was a growing fear of further job losses as companies face sluggish demand in the domestic and overseas markets. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, has focused on unemployment, high prices, and what he says are Modi’s divisive politics in a cross-country march on foot. Gopal Krishna Agarwal, the economic affairs spokesman of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, said instead of offering “helicopter money” to unemployed youth, the Modi government has followed a policy of generating jobs by pushing economic growth and supporting manufacturing. “The economy is on a recovery path and inflation has moderated,” he said. “The annual budget next month will continue the policy of stimulating the economy through incentives for more sectors.” Critics said this may not work in the short term. Incentives given to a few corporates are not creating enough jobs, said Kumar, the economist, adding the economy was in a “K-shaped” recovery – growth in big companies accompanied by a decline in the number of small firms and jobs. – Rappler.com $1 = 81.7090 Indian rupees"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/supreme-court-finds-teacher-guilty-child-abuse-stuffing-trash-students-mouths/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court has sentenced a teacher to a maximum of six years in prison for forcing her students to place trash in their mouths in their classroom. The High Court affirmed the decisions of the lower court of Antipolo City and of the appellate court, which found Melany B. Garin guilty of child abuse, in violation of Republic Act 7610, the law that protects children from abuse, exploitation, and discrimination. The SC, however, said the Court of Appeals erred when it dropped the part of the Antipolo court’s ruling that awarded damages to the lone student who filed a complaint against the teacher. The SC therefore ordered Garin to pay the student: The awarded damages will earn legal interest of 6% every year until the teacher is able to pay the amount in full. Garin had petitioned the SC to review the CA’s decision that affirmed the Antipolo Regional Trial Court ruling. Denying the teacher’s petition, the High Court said Garin’s act was in fact “deplorable” – it affected the mental and emotional development of the student. The abuse also caused the student to suffer from lead poisoning and post-traumatic stress disorder. “Any person who commits an act that debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being” is liable under Section 10, Article VI of RA 7610, the SC said. “While it may be true that not every instance of laying of hands on the child would constitute child-abuse, petitioner’s intention can be inferred from the manner in which she committed the act complained.” The SC also said: “On this score, petitioner’s act of forcing the victim, AAA, and his classmates to place in their mouths pieces of trash, consisting of scraps of paper, pencil shaving, dirt, and candy wrappers from the classroom’s dustpan, undoubtedly debased, degraded and demeaned their intrinsic worth and dignity as children. “As eloquently pronounced by the CA, no self-respecting human being would voluntarily place pieces of garbage in his or her mouth unless unduly coerced to do so. The gravity of petitioner’s action becomes all the more pronounced considering that the incident occurred in class and by reason of her moral ascendancy as AAA’s teacher.” Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s Amended Administrative Circular No. 83-2015, the court withheld the identity and any information that could establish the identity of the student. – Rappler.com"

The Association of Concerned CDC Employees said 551 employees were affected by the discontinuation of allowances, benefits, and incentives under the Compensation and Position Classification System (CPCS) since December 14, when the management lifted an earlier order to maintain the status quo. Association president Edsel Manalili said the amount deducted from their January 15 salary ranged from P4,800 to P5,250. “Sa rank and file, between P4,800 to P5,250 monthly. It varies, depending on one’s rank,” Manalili told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino on Monday, January 23. He said the first benefits to go were allowances to fund retirement and health plans. Then in January, the CDC implemented the CPCS. By the January 15 payday, all allowances and benefits were gone, Manalili added. What was worse, he said, was the contrast of officials getting pay hikes. “Isipin nyo mga allowances hindi na tinatamasa ng mga manggagawa ng CDC. (Imagine workers losing their allowances.) Last January 11, based on the GCG’s letter, who enjoyed increased income? The management. But rank and file employees had none. In fact, some diminution of position happened,” the labor leader said. He said the decision of the GCG on their appeal demoralized CDC employees. Manalili said that after the December 14 memo lifting the status quo, they filed a notice of strike on December 27. When they went on strike on January 16, the labor department under Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed jurisdiction (AJ) over the dispute. A CDC statement on January 21 said the DOLE secretary issued an AJ order on January 13. Laguesma directed the CDC to put in escrow in favor of the employees concerned the amounts corresponding to the difference in monetary values between the GCG-approved pay and that guaranteed under their collective bargaining agreement. CDC president and chief executive officer Agnes VST Devanadera said that the CDC management will exhaust all efforts and legal means to address the concerns of the employees on salary and benefits under the CPCS. “We are not the enemies here and we all have our own roles to play. However,  we ask for the employees’ understanding and patience because we are doing everything we can, and we are already talking with top officials who support us. Let us be strategic and take the bull by the horns,” said Devanadera. Following GCG’s decision on CDC’s motion for reconsideration of the initial Authority to Implement (ATI) the June 17, 2022, CPCS, the CDC management said it would pursue all administrative remedies, including seeking the intervention of the Office of the President to address the employees’ concerns. CDC management also vowed to expedite the reorganization to address the issues of job description and job gradings. A memo issued by Devenadera on January 18 said the CDC will “request and obtain necessary approvals prescribed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) for the release of the supplemental budget to enforce the January 11 ATI. This, she said, would be retroactive from October 5, 2021 either at step 1 or the step nearest to the personnel’s present basic monthly pay, following the CPCS guidelines on non-diminution of salaries. GCG issued its resolution on the motion for reconsideration filed by CDC last January 11 with  reconsiderations of job grade assignments and inclusion of co-terminus positions. Positions on Job Level 12 and up were reconsidered to be 2 steps higher, while those on Job Level 11 and below were reconsidered to be one step higher. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/japan-warns-dire-finances-central-bank-struggles-contain-yields-january-2023/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – Japan’s finances are becoming increasingly precarious, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki warned on Monday, January 23, just as markets test whether the central bank can keep interest rates ultra-low, allowing the government to service its debt. The government has been helped by near-zero bond yields, but bond investors have recently sought to break the Bank of Japan‘s (BOJ) 0.5% cap on the 10-year bond yield, as inflation runs at 41-year highs, double the central bank’s 2% target. “Japan’s public finances have increased in severity to an unprecedented degree as we have compiled supplementary budgets to respond to the coronavirus and similar issues,” Suzuki said in a policy speech starting a session of parliament. It is not unusual for the finance minister to refer to Japan’s strained finances. Despite the country’s growing debt pile, the government remains under pressure to keep the fiscal spigot wide open. Japan must balance regional security concerns over China, Russia, and North Korea, and manage a debt burden more than twice the size of its $5-trillion economy – by far the heaviest burden in the industrialized world. Markets showed little reaction to Suzuki’s speech, in which he explained the details of the coming fiscal year’s state budget worth a record 114.4 trillion yen ($878.9 billion). Suzuki reiterated the government’s aim to achieve an annual budget surplus – excluding new bond sales and debt-servicing costs – in the fiscal year to March 2026. The government, however, has missed budget-balancing targets for a decade. The Ministry of Finance estimates that every 1-percentage-point rise in interest rates would boost debt service by 3.7 trillion yen to 32.5 trillion yen for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. “The government will strive to stably manage Japanese government bond (JGBs) issuance through close communication with the market,” he said. “Overall JGB issuance, including rolling over bonds, remain at an extremely high level worth about 206 trillion yen. We will step up efforts to keep JGB issuance stable.” “Public finance is the cornerstone of a country’s trust. We must secure fiscal space under normal circumstances to safeguard trust in Japan and people’s livelihood at a time of emergency.” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida echoed Suzuki’s resolve to revive the economy and tackle fiscal reform. He stressed the need for a positive cycle of growth led by corporate profits and private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy. “Wage hikes hold the key to this virtuous cycle,” Kishida said in his policy speech. He vowed to push labor reform to create a structure that allows sustainable wage growth and overcome the pain of rising living costs. “First of all, we need to realize wage growth that exceeds price increases,” Kishida added, pledging to also boost childcare support, and push investment and reform in areas such as green and digital transformation. – Rappler.com $1 = 129.5700 yen"

It was Djokovic’s 38th consecutive win on Australian soil and the fewest number of games he has dropped in a match at the year’s first major since he lost four against Lucas Pouille in the semifinals in 2019. Asked after the match why he beat De Minaur the way he did, Djokovic replied: “Because I wanted to.” Djokovic drew first blood after a breathless start to the match when De Minaur crashed a forehand into the net to allow the fourth seed to go up 4-2 and the Serbian consolidated the break and struck again to claim the first set. Having never lost at Melbourne Park since the fourth round in 2018, the 35-year-old was in no mood to give De Minaur a sniff of a chance on Rod Laver Arena, as he raced out of the blocks and dominated his opponent with blistering shots on both wings. “I can’t say I’m sorry you’ve not watched a longer match,” Djokovic told fans. “I wanted to win in straight sets. Once on the court, you have to deal with a lot of things… the first four, five games were close and after the break I started feeing more loose and more aggressive.” “He was a bit more nervous and that was my opportunity to capitalize. Tennis is a quick, dynamic sport, so things change in a matter of moments, but I was able to play my best match of the year.” Djokovic also said that he did not face any issues with his hamstring for the first time in the tournament. “I’ve been taking a lot of pills to mask the pain, not those kinds of pills guys,” he said to laughs. “Anti-inflammatory… I don’t want to go too deep into it, but today was the best day of the tournament.” Up two sets to love and with his heavily-strapped hamstring cooperating after scares in the last two rounds, Djokovic moved in for the kill by taking the first four games of the third and finished in style to gear up for fifth seed Andrey Rublev next. “He’s an established top-five player,” Djokovic added. “He has incredible fire power from his serve and forehand, explosive – a lot like De Minaur – so hopefully the result is the same.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/how-cold-storages-save-empower-onion-farmers-feed-philippines/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Even as high onion prices have hit producers and consumers alike, agriculturists see the Philippines has all it takes to be 100% onion self-sufficient. But with a lack of government support in building crucial cold storages, onion farmers are left in misery either watching their harvest waste away or settling for unlivable pay. Romel Calingasan, the municipal agriculturist of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, spoke with grit as he bared the grim reality that local farmers face. “During po ng harvest season, wala po kaming nahanap na slot na mga storage facilities dahil ang sabi po, puno na ang mga storage facilities dito po sa Metro Manila, at ganun din po sa amin,” he said at a Senate hearing on January 16. (During the harvest season, we couldn’t find any slots for storage facilities because they said all the storage facilities in Metro Manila and our area were already full.) All the cold storages were – inexplicably – full, or at least not available. It turned out traders had reserved many of the facilities months in advance. That was when onions were left to rot by the side of the road and on the banks of rivers. “Marami pong mga sibuyas ang nagkandabulukan, itinapon sa mga tabi ng kalsada, sa mga gilid ng ilog, na kung saan po talaga pong sobrang panghihinayang ang amin pong naramdaman kasi po talagang pinagkagastusan ng aming mga magsasaka ‘yan,” he said. (A lot of onions were rotting, thrown to the roadsides, to the riversides. We felt so much regret for all that were spent by our farmers.) See, like all crops, onions stay fresh only for so long. Once harvested, they need to either be brought to the market within days or kept in cold storage. For farmers who lack access to these facilities, they have little choice but to quickly offload their harvest – for which they had spent months laboring – for whatever they could get. For farmers in Occidental Mindoro, that meant settling for just P6 per kilo as traders swooped in to take advantage of low prices. It was a pittance or pure waste, never mind a profit. But perhaps worst of all, Calingasan said, farmers watched as the onions they sold for next to nothing would bleed the wallets of customers dry come December. “‘Yung mga binebenta po sa merkado sa kasalukuyan ngayon na buwan ng September hanggang December…binili sa mga magsasaka namin sa Occidental Mindoro na P8 to P15 lang per kilo. Kaya ganun na lang po ang pagkadismaya ng amin pong mga magsasaka sa amin pong lalawigan,” he said. (Those sold at the market from September until December…they were bought from us in Occidental Mindoro for just P8 to P15 per kilo. You can just imagine the dismay of our farmers from our province.) And now with the specter of imports threatening to plunge farmgate prices even lower, farmers are pleading with the government to give them the support they need to negotiate livable prices. The country’s agricultural woes are many and varied, but farmers say a good start is setting up more cold storages – in particular, ones readily accessible to farmers. But first, what is cold storage, and why do farmers need them? Like the name suggests, a cold storage facility is a walk-in room kept cool by a refrigeration system. A rudimentary cold storage facility can be set up using a modified air conditioner and double-walled plywood panels with polystyrene sheets for insulation. Most commercial cold storage facilities are now built as large cooler units using hydrocarbon or freon as a refrigerant. Fruits and vegetables, seafood products, meat products, and dairy products can all be kept in cold storage to prolong their shelf life. Onions, of course, are among the produce often stored here. Onions need to be gradually lowered in temperature before being transferred into the cold rooms. The produce is then stored in string bags, which are stacked on top of each other. When done properly, cold storage facilities can extend the shelf life of onions from mere days to as long as six months. In its Philippine Onion Industry Roadmap, the DA identified cold storage facilities as a crucial support industry to “balance the peaks and trough of onion supply.” In doing so, cold storage provides three key benefits: Price negotiations hinge on this imbalance of access to cold storage facilities. Farmers often don’t possess the capital to set up their own cold storages, as a single facility can cost up to P40 million. Because of the prohibitive cost, many facilities are private-owned and contracted by traders that take advantage of the swings in supply. They buy onions at low prices when farmers have plenty on hand during the harvest season, and stockpile them until supplies start running low and prices begin to rise. “Noong mapabagsak nila ang presyo, mamimili sila, ilalagay nila sa cold storage, hindi muna sila mag-i-import. Kaya naging P600-P700 ang kilo ng sibuyas, dahil hawak nila ang lahat ng sibuyas. Napakalinaw na merong cartel,” explained AGAP Representative Nicanor Briones during the Senate hearing. (When traders manage to crash prices, they’ll buy onions, place them in cold storage, and stop imports. The reason why onions reached P600-P700 per kilo was because they hold all the onions. It’s very clear that there’s a cartel.) For this reason, former agriculture secretary William Dar pointed out that making cold storages accessible to farmers will help them in negotiating for better prices, as they can store onions on their own until they can get a better payout. “It’s the cold storages that will spell the difference so that the cooperatives of onion producers will be able to leverage with traders,” said Dar in an interview on ANC’s Headstart. “If there is the possibility of having cold storages to be given to cooperatives of onion producers, they can hold these until they are able to get better prices in the market. That will give them the leverage to now discuss with traders. Presently, kung wala silang cold storages, ay talagang binabarat ng mga traders (Presently, if they don’t have cold storages, traders will lowball them),” he added. Farmers derided the way traders manipulated prices by hoarding onions in cold storages as well as reserving the cold storages for themselves – even if they sat empty. Senator Cynthia Villar revealed that in 2014, she saw how traders cornered and controlled cold storage facilities in Nueva Ecija, cutting out access to farmers. “Nagpunta kami ni secretary (Proceso) Alcala doon. Nakita niya with his two eyes na walang laman ‘yung cold storage kasi naka-reserve sa trader. Ang trader, sila lang ang makakabili,” Villar said during the Senate hearing. (I went with secretary Alcala there. He saw with his two eyes that the cold storage was empty because it was reserved for a trader. These traders, they’re the only ones who can afford them.) On top of the imbalance in access, some facilities are just poorly located. Calingasan pointed out, for instance, how a planned cold storage in the municipality of Rizal is 16 kilometers away from San Jose, the largest onion-producing municipality of Occidental Mindoro. The other planned facility in Sablayan is even farther away at 97 kilometers. Calingasan is right. Below is a map of Philippine provinces shaded based on how many cold storage facilities they have, and another based on how many metric tons of onions they produced in 2022. Comparing the two gives a sense of the mismatch between where cold storage facilities are located and where onion production is highest. Most facilities are clustered around industrial centers like Manila, Cavite, and Cebu, even if they have no onion production to speak of. A 2020 report by the Cold Chain Innovation Hub highlighted the lack of cold storage facilities near farms, concluding that “the current lack of post-harvest facilities and cold chain practices are resulting in major post-harvest losses in the crops sub-sector.” The lack of cold storages has constantly held back their municipality from reaching its potential as a top producer of onions in the country, Calingasan said. “Last year po ay nakapagtala ng 3,485 hectares of onion production sa aming bayan. Wala pa po sa 5% ng aming production volume ang amin pong nailagay sa mga storage facilities. ‘Yung 95% ng aming production, ‘yan po sapilitang naibenta po sa mga buyers ng P8,” the municipal agriculturist said. (Last year, we recorded 3,485 hectares of onion production in our area. Not even 5% of this production volume was placed in storage facilities. The other 95% of our production we were forced to sell to buyers at P8.) What can be done to combat this? Farmers’ groups highlight two ways: first, to set up more cold storages dedicated to farmers, and second, to create stronger policies against exploitative behavior – be it by traders, importers, or smugglers. “Definitely, there is a shortage of cold storage, but government will have to establish new ones exclusively for farmers’ – and not traders’ – use,” said Raul Montemayor, national manager of the Federation of Free Farmers Cooperatives Incorporated. “My understanding is that cold storage space is reserved in advance by traders, so farmers have little access to these.” However, building more cold storages alone will not eliminate the problem. Montemayor pointed out that come harvest time, most farmers are pressured to sell their crops quickly to repay their agricultural debts. Waiting around for better prices may mean that famers won’t be able to get loans anew in time for the next planting season. “They need to sell their harvests immediately to pay off debts and generate money for their needs,” he told Rappler on January 17. Hence, it’s also necessary for the government to also provide inventory financing, which means that farmers would be able to borrow money against any onions that they have stored. “These should be completed by inventory financing and market linkaging, so farmers will eventually be able to sell to final buyers without having to go through middlemen,” Montemayor said. “If there is no inventory financing, only a few farmers and co-ops will avail of the cold storage because of their immediate cash needs. So, it has to be planned out well, which the DA is not good at.” Market manipulation also continues to be a problem, as the DA itself identified in its Philippine Onion Industry Roadmap. Tackling this requires the government to crack down on exploitative practices and allow timely imports. “There must be a strong policy regarding storage and market release of onion as it affects market pricing. Hoarders wait for higher market prices. They are not disincentivized to do this because payment for storage is fixed at six months minimum,” the DA wrote. Montemayor explained that during the February to April harvest time, traders compete for farmers’ harvests, with prices based on their projection of current and future prices at the wholesale level. Ideally, traders place crops in cold storage to last until the next harvest, with stocks being trickled into the market as needed. The supply of onions in cold storage, however, begins to thin out by the end of the year, Montemayor said, with imports often filling the gap. “By November, stocks will be in short supply, and prices will go up if imports are not allowed to come in. It is very possible that the smugglers or cartels are also pressuring the government not to allow imports, so that supply will be tight, and they will be able to sell their smuggled or stored stocks at higher prices,” he said. The DA has ambitious plans to address the pleas of farmers, setting a lofty goal to construct 105 new cold storages by 2025 – at least, according to its roadmap. It remains to be seen if and how the DA will carry this out. This hasn’t stopped farmers, who have already overcome challenge after challenge, from boldly proclaiming they have what it takes to lead the country down the road to onion self-sufficiency. “Kami tataya – ako, bilang municipal agriculturist ng San Jose – kaya ko pong itaya ang lugar po namin para mag-supply ng sibuyas,” Calingasan said. “Ang kailangan lang po talaga ay support ng national government, particular po sa cold storage facilities.“ (As the municipal agriculturist of San Jose, I can bet that our municipality will be able to supply onions. All we really need is support from the national government, particularly for cold storage facilities.) – Rappler.com"

In a hearing on Monday, January 23, Senate committee on ways and means chairman Sherwin Gatchalian grilled officials of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) as to why the agency entered into a P6-billion consultancy contract with Global ComRCI in 2017 to monitor revenues of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs), despite glaring inconsistencies in its documents. Past hearings found that there was a tax leakage of P9.1 billion due to discrepancies in gross gaming revenues reported by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Pagcor, and POGOs. Gatchalian said his research team found that Global ComRCI engaged a certain Soleil Chartered Bank to certify that it had at least $25 million (around P1.3 billion) in funds. Pagcor’s bidding requirements specified that companies should have at least P1 billion in capital. But the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said Soleil is not registered in the Philippines and is not allowed to operate. A simple online search would also point to stories about fraudulent activities associated with Soleil. Gatchalian’s office also found that Global ComRCI is not registered in Makati City, despite indicating its business address there. “Sa dami ng tao sa Pagcor, ewan ko paano kayo nabudol. Unless sinadya ‘nyong mabudol kayo,” the senator said. (With the many personnel of Pagcor, I don’t know how you were duped. Unless you got duped on purpose.) Roderick Consolacion, Pagcor’s vice president for legal affairs, then said that the bidding rules “allowed it,” without elaborating on the content of Global ComRCI’s documents. Asked how Pagcor could have missed the issues with Global ComRCI in the past five years, Consolacion only replied, “Yes, your honor.” Global ComRCI officials were invited to the hearing but did not attend. “The third-party auditor is not credible, is not capable. The third-party auditor is not qualified, simple things like address and business permit wala sila (they don’t have), so how do you expect us to believe what they’re supplying to us, in the form of information, is accurate?” Gatchalian told Pagcor officials. So far, Pagcor has paid Global ComRCI P842 million in consultancy fees alone, excluding other services. But according to the company’s financial statements, it only earned around P7 million, which could mean that it grossly underreported its earnings to evade taxes. Lawmakers also questioned Pagcor officials for being lenient with POGOs that are allegedly tied to criminal activities. In December 2022, Senator Grace Poe alerted regulators and law enforcement authorities of an incident where a woman fell victim to a bogus job vacancy and was kidnapped by a POGO. The female victim was brought to a POGO dorm in Shuang Ma Industrial Park in Bacoor City, Cavite, where she was rescued after relatives paid ransom of P250,000. The POGOs implicated in the alleged kidnapping are Brickhartz Technology and MOA Cloudzone. The companies are still operating. Pagcor Assistant Vice President Jessa Fernandez said Brickhartz was fined around P500,000, while they have yet to receive a report for MOA Cloudzone. “You’re just telling us that you just fined them P500,000, hoping that they will change morally,” Gatchalian told Fernandez. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-academe-strikes-back-rise-ai/,[],"Just recently, a UP Department of History Professor posted on Facebook an essay that was confirmed to be generated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). This scenario sparked a discussion on the use of AI and how the academe and educational systems should respond to it. It is important to take note that this not an attack on AI in general, but a caution to all educators and learners that the use of AI as a tool has its limits. First, AI tools are juxtaposing the purpose of the academe; that is to develop, nurture, and exhibit the authentic exercise of critical thinking. Cases of students using AI generators to complete their emails, essays, and even academic terminal papers are considered a new form of academic dishonesty. Here, then, comes the misconception that educators are anti-technology. The truth is far from that. In fact, technology makes the tedious work of teaching better (i.e. the transfer from the use of manila papers and traditional visual aids to slide presentations; learning management systems, and hybrid forms of learning modalities, among others). However, caution and skepticism should be entertained and considered, especially if they are detrimental to the overarching core values of why the academe exists – to teach students how to think critically and transform this pivotal asset into formulating genuine reforms. Second, in relation to the first, educators are now faced with a new challenge: how academic institutions, their faculty and staff, and existing policies should adapt to the challenges posed by AI. The potentiality of academic dishonesty is ever-evolving, since the emergence of the “technological fix” (e.g. Citation Machine, Quillbot for paraphrasing, ChatGPT, Jenni AI, among others). When, then, will academic institutions be ready to face and proactively act upon this situation? How would the majority of state universities and colleges (SUCs) and local colleges and universities (LCUs) be equipped? Will potential regulation on the use of AI as tools for academic task completion be standardized and promulgated by governing bodies such as the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)? Third, the rise of AI is currently being underestimated by many, and its multi-sectoral effects should be up for discussion and brought to the fore. For example, the talk about Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a potential response to the domination of AI taking over jobs across industries and sectors is up for discussion. The potential of robots serving people food and drinks instead of an actual employee can become possible, which means that on the grand scale of things, its rise could potentially harm labor practices and how human capital is further developed. This goes back to the role of the academe not just to develop human capital, but to amplify the importance of authenticity of thought, together with the continuous advancement of technology. I believe that the rise of technology should go hand-in-hand with the enrichment of authentic and critical thought. It is also noteworthy that technological advancement does not always equate to progress and development. Time is ticking, and it is possible that AI generators will be adapted for multi-lingual orientations, which means that it could potentially generate academic requirements based on local languages. All they need is data. This calls for the revival of oral examinations. One article from The New York Times entitled, “If It Was Good for Socrates, It’s Good Enough for Sophomores” argues for the resurgence of the oral exams to test the “intellectual agility” of a learner and if a learner truly learns from a class. Aside from this alternative, there are suggestions for the revival of face-to-face written exams – a typical written exam where a student would write one’s thoughts on a sheet of paper based on a question given by an instructor. Whatever method is done, it is vital for all academics and educators to advance the idea that students themselves should know and understand the importance of thinking critically, that thinking would maximize their capabilities as human beings. Moreover, academic excellence, the pursuit of what Aristotle called eudaimonia or “human flourishing,” and the rise of technology should go hand-in-hand. This will remain a challenge if discussions and consideration of various lenses will not be created. – Rappler.com Juniesy Estanislao earned his Bachelor’s in Secondary Education, Major in Social Studies at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Marikina in 2018.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/suansing-seeks-subpoena-individuals-large-scale-agriculture-smuggling-investigation/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – A lawmaker proposed on Monday, January 23, to compel 10 individuals to face the House ways and means panel and respond to allegations that they are involved in large-scale agricultural smuggling in Philippine ports. Sultan Kudarat 2nd District Representative Horacio Suansing Jr. initially called on the committee to issue a subpoena against the following brokers, importers, and facilitators: Based on a copy of a speech provided to the media by Suansing’s office, the 10 individuals had links either to the Port of Manila, Manila International Container Port, or Bureau of Customs (BOC). “It is the main objective of this inquiry to uncover the unscrupulous activities of officials and personnel of the Bureau of Customs and of the Department of Agriculture (DA), who have enabled and expedited widespread agricultural product smuggling into the Philippines,” Suansing said. Later in the ways and means panel hearing, Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda, the committee chairman, granted a verbal motion by Suansing to invite the individuals to the committee’s next hearing. Salceda’s staff explained to Rappler that under the rules, “there should be at least two meetings where the invitee did not honor the invitation,” before subpoenas can be issued. A committee chairperson recommends the issuance of subpoenas, which are then signed by the House Speaker. Suansing also asked the concerned agencies to provide records on the following consignees: In his presentation, Salceda sounded the alarm on agricultural smuggling in the Philippines, which he said has seen an uptrend since the start of the pandemic, and has cost the country P5.3 billion in lost duties. He noted that the prices of onion, sugar, pork, beef, and chicken in Philippine markets are significantly more expensive than the prevailing world prices. Specifically, the price of onion in the Philippines is 457% more costly than the global average. The BOC told the House committee that the agency recorded 53 arrests for onion smuggling in 2022 alone. It has filed 15 criminal complaints as of 2023, all of which are still under preliminary investigation. “Smuggling will really proliferate because we are still in the preliminary investigation phase. We are not able to go after anyone,” Brosas said. The DA, headed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has approved the importation of 21,060 metric tons of onions to address the onion crisis. But this has caused extreme stress to local farmers, who said the poor timing of the move would allow traders to use the “import card” as a bargaining chip in order to buy onions from farmers at a price that would hurt them. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/house-approves-bill-seeking-protect-people-freedom-religion/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – The House of Representatives on Monday, January 23, passed on final reading a measure that seeks to operationalize the constitutional provision on the freedom of religion. Under House Bill No. 6492 or the Magna Carta on Religious Freedom Act, the government must ensure that none of its acts will curtail a person’s right to exercise their religious belief, unless it results in violence, or is against public safety. The bill enumerates the acts that curtail people’s right to religious freedom, such as compelling anyone by force, threat, intimidation, or undue influence to subscribe or not to subscribe to a particular religious belief; threatening someone to prevent them from changing religion; and hindering them to exercise any expression of their religious belief. First-time violators will face monetary penalties of up to P500,000, and jail sentence of up to eight years. The Department of Justice will also be compelled to establish a hotline specifically for concerns regarding religious freedom. The measure was introduced in the 19th Congress by representatives Luis Raymund Villafuerte, Jr., Miguel Luis Villafuerte, Tsuyoshi Anthony Horibata, Nicolas Enciso VIII, Eddie Villanueva and Bienvenido Abante, Jr. It hurdled the House with 256 lawmakers voting yes to the bill, one congressman voting no, and three others voting to abstain. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/detention-tacloban-5-causing-mental-pain-their-families/,[],"TACLOBAN, Philippines – The families f five activists, collectively called the Tacloban 5, also suffer mental stress for every day their kin remain in detention, a sister of one of two women who attended a court hearing on Monday, January 23 said. Journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio and Marielle “Maye” Domequil, a lay worker and finance officer of the Rural Missionaries Philippines – Eastern Visayas, were whisked in and out of the Tacloban Regional Trial Court Branch 45 under very tight security, with media kept away from them. It was the first hearing for additional charges on alleged ” terrorist financing,” against Cumpio and Domequil. They and Alexander Philip Abinguna were earlier slapped with illegal possession of firearms and explosives charges. The three were arrested before dawn of February 7, 2020 at the office of alternative news outfit Eastern Vista, where Cumpio was editor. They were with two other activists now out on bail: Mira Legion, former KASAMA sa UP Vice chairperson for Visayas; and Marissa Cabaljao of People’s Surge. The January 23 hearing coincided with Cumpio’s 24th birthday. Kyle Domequil, sister of Maye, said they had greeted Cumpio during a visit on January 22. Aside from cupcakes and brownies, Kyle said, “we also brought books and novels, from friends of Ate Maye and my friends, too.” They also gave the detainees notebooks for their journal writing. Kyle spoke of how hard it was for the family to be separated from Maye for three years. “Naka-apekto ito sa aming mental health. Meron kami sariling struggles,” she told Rappler in an interview after the January 23 hearing. (This has affected our mental health. We ourselves struggle.) “My parents are always worried about her,” she added. “We know the charges are not true. So this is traumatic for all of us.” Kyle said the family is also witness to the continuing red-tagging. “They defaced Ate’s graduation picture. Words can’t describe how angry and sad I feel,” Kyle said. As their parents are ailing and not equipped to deal with technology, the work of coordinating the collection of evidence of her sister’s innocence falls on Kyle’s shoulders. “It takes a toll on my mental health. It triggers my depressive episodes po,” she said. “Even being here in Tacloban is hard. It is a traumatic place for our family.” Kyle tries to cope by being a volunteer for the cause Maye works for. “It’s where I feel closest to Ate because she is a lay worker who has sacrificed a lot for others,” she told Rappler. “I try to look for Ate in the faces of the masses that I meet. My parents and other sibling try to busy themselves with work to escape the pain,” Kyle said. “Sometimes we can’t even talk about it because it feels like scratching at a still open wound.” Rappler chief executive officer and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa mentioned Cumpio during her Nobel acceptance lecture. On her and Rappler’s acquittal on tax evasion charges on January 18, Ressa dedicated the legal victory to all unjustly accused, including detained former senator Leila de Lima and Cumpio. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines held a protest outside of the Department of Justice, to highlight how “lawfare” has been used in attempts to silence not only the media, but also civil society groups. NUJP chairman Jonathan de Santos noted the continuing red-tagging, website blocking, and the growing number of cyber libel cases slapped against critical media and netizens. “They say that if journalists are not doing anything wrong, we shouldn’t fear the Anti-Terror Law and the campaign against so-called terrorists. But we clearly see that coverage of human rights and community issues are often seen as offensive, and that anyone can be arrested even under a defective warrant,” de Santos said. The raid on Eastern Vista was part of a series operations by the Philippine National Police on alleged “communist-terrorist” staff houses in Tacloban. Under then president Rodrigo Duterte, state security forces routinely tagged legal organizations as “terrorists”. As it greeted Cumpio on her birthday, Altermidya, the network of alternative news outfits that includes Eastern Vista, called the terrorist financing charge as “trumped-up”. “The charge made by the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) against Frenchie and Mariel is connected to the money that was confiscated in the raid conducted by joint forces of the police and military at the two’s boarding house on February 7,” Altermidya’s statement read. “Two supposed rebel surrenderees were presented by the military to allege that the money is supposedly to finance the New People’s Army (NPA),” the media network added. Around P500,000 in seized money underwent a civil forfeiture case at the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 18. “It was granted in favor of the government in December last year, without prompt notice to Frenchie, Mariel, or their legal counsel,” Altermidya pointed out. Prior to her arrest, Frenchie faced incessant red-tagging and had documented harassment and surveillance incidents which she believes were done by state forces, her Altermiya colleagues said. “As a community journalist and radio anchor, Frenchie covered and gave critical analysis to the stories of the struggling people of Eastern Visayas. For that, she was targeted.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/photos-chinese-new-year-binondo-manila/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – 2023’s Chinese New Year marks the start of the Year of the Rabbit, known to bring peace, stability, and good luck. In the Philippines, one of the most popular places to celebrate the Chinese New Year is in Binondo, Manila, where a large Filipino-Chinese community resides. Despite the ongoing pandemic, Manila celebrated for four days straight, with festivities including a food festival, a dragon dance display, a solidarity parade, and for the first time, a dragon boat race. The public was still advised to wear face masks in crowded areas to prevent COVID infection. The streets of Binondo were filled with vibrant colors and traditional Chinese decorations – red lanterns, golden trinkets, and banners lining the streets. Lucky charms, kid’s toys, and those indispensable boxes of tikoy (Chinese New Year pudding) dominated the stalls of vendors along the street. Even small animals such as colored chicks, ducks, and baby rabbits were sold at notable corners. Another exciting aspect of this year’s celebrations is the return of the fire dancers, post-lockdown. These performers, usually from the LGBTQ+ community, skillfully manipulate fire by spewing gasoline from their mouth towards a flaming torch, mimicking the dragon’s flames. The highlight of the festival was the dragon dance display, where teams of performers dressed in brightly colored dragon costumes danced and paraded through the streets. It was the children dancing with makeshift lions and dragons made from cardboard or fruit baskets, however, who really stole the show. The dragon dance is said to bring good luck and fortune for the new year. Mark Chioa, a delivery rider and Golden Dragon Dancer, holds an alternate identity as Grab Spidey, a famed icon and cosplayer known to dance with the dragons and lions during the festival. Due to the pandemic lockdown, he has yet to suit up, but he expresses gratitude that the celebration is back. Because of the smaller crowd, however, he notes that his team will be receiving fewer red envelopes or ampao this year. “Nung lockdown hirap. Hindi makakilos, boring, at nakakastress mas lalo na nagdradragon kami. At least ngayon masaya at may mga tao na. Pero hindi parin ito tulad nang dati. Dagsaan talaga ang mga tao at mas marami pa kaming nakukuhang ampao noon. Pero okay na rin. Unang taon ng pagbabalik nito, sana sa susunod na taon, dumami ulit ang tao,” Mark shares. (It was hard during the lockdown. We couldn’t move around, it was boring, and it was stressful especially since we were dragon dancing. At least now, it’s happier and there are more people around, though it’s not like before. Back then, there were droves of people and we’d get a lot of money from them. But it’s alright. It’s our first year back after a while, so hopefully there’ll be more people next year.) Matthew Paz, who has always celebrated the new year in Binondo with his family, visited the temple at midnight. With no long lines, he was able to leave the temple right before the clock struck 12. Matthew explains that there are fewer people at the temple this year because of the pandemic. “It’s usually the older generation who would traditionally visit the temple at midnight. But since the pandemic, either the elderly prefer to avoid the crowd or their family refuses to let them go,” he said. Despite the challenges brought by the pandemic, the Chinese New Year in Binondo continues to attract a significant number of visitors. The Manila Police District reported that a cumulated number of 600,000 people visited Binondo to welcome the Chinese New Year on Saturday, January 21, with 15,000 people visiting as of 12 pm on Sunday, January 22 – the actual New Year’s Day. At least 3,200 policemen were deployed for the events, according to PMaj. Philipp Ines, Manila Police District (MPD) spokesman. He also said they were backed by volunteer security organizations to ensure the safety of the people celebrating. Sydneylyn Tan, manager of a hotel in Binondo, praised the various organizations involved in organizing the Chinese New Year celebrations in the area. She noted that there was a clear chain of command and that each individual involved had a specific task to accomplish. “This year’s celebration is exciting since we didn’t have any celebration at all for the past two years. We just did the regular social media posting. Starting Monday, the Ongpin street was already closed to prepare for the celebration. The barangay officials are really hands-on to manage the people, crowd, and everything else. It’s exciting to know that the local government, the private entities are all chipping in to make this event really festive. Mas planned na ang mga events this year (The event are better planned this year). Very clear ang mga entities involved (The entities involved are very clear), like the DTCAM (Department of Tourism, Culture and Arts of Manila), who was the clear lead for this event, really planned it out and disseminated the information needed,” she said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. also recognized the cultural and historical significance of the Chinese New Year celebrations in the Philippines. In a message, he called on Filipinos, including those of Chinese descent, to appreciate the richness of the celebration and the ties it creates between cultures. He described the celebration as “a new dawn that symbolizes our boundless wishes for prosperity for ourselves and our society.” The Pyromusical Show for the Chinese New Year Countdown was launched at the newly built Intramuros-Binondo bridge for the first time. The bridge serves as a symbol of cooperation and partnership between the Philippines and China, as China provided financial assistance for the construction of the bridge. This highlights the increasing economic and cultural ties between the two countries. The bridge connects the Philippines’ oldest district, Intramuros, and Binondo, the oldest Chinatown in the world. Overall, the Chinese New Year in Binondo, Manila was a success, with thousands of visitors flocking to the area to take part in the festivities and celebrate the new year with renewed hope. Despite the challenges brought by the pandemic, the celebrations continued to showcase the rich culture and tradition of the Filipino-Chinese community, with the different stakeholders excited for the next celebrations to come. – Rappler.com"

Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video containing the claim has over 6,100 views as of writing. No statement from BSP: There are no announcements on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) official Facebook and Twitter pages about either the removal of the Aquinos’ faces in the design of the P500 bill or about redesigning the said bill. A big decision like redesigning a bill is usually announced by the country’s central bank, just like what it did during the introduction of a new design of the P1,000 bill. During the introduction of a new design of the P1,000 bill, then-BSP governor Benjamin Diokno said there were still no discussions about replacing Ninoy and Cory in the P500 bill. On December 7, 2022, BSP presented to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. the new P1,000 polymer banknote and the new banknotes bearing Marcos’ signature. The topic of redesigning the P500 bill was not discussed at the said event. Likely to be replaced with plants, animals: Although there is no announcement about redesigning the P500 bill or any other banknote, the next design of these banknotes will likely feature plants and animals. Diokno said during the introduction of the new design of the P1,000 bill that “the new series will focus on fauna and flora in the Philippines.” Previously fact-checked: Similar claims about the alleged new design of the P500 bill have been fact-checked by Rappler, PhilStar.com, PressONE.PH, and ABS-CBN  in the past. – Lorenz Pasion/Rappler.com

Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections under the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty were due to take place in November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them and neither side has set a new date for a meeting. Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, said the conditions were not right for new talks on the treaty, which caps the number of each side’s strategic nuclear warheads. “The situation does not, frankly speaking, allow for setting a new date, … taking into account this escalation trend in both rhetoric and actions by the United States,” Ryabkov was quoted by Interfax as saying. Already poor US-Russia ties became even more strained last year when Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting Washington and its allies to respond with a barrage of sanctions against Russia’s economy. While there have been occasional diplomatic successes, including prisoner swaps involving US Marine veteran Trevor Reed and basketball star Brittney Griner, direct high-level contact has been scarce.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/crisis-basilan-rubber-tree-leaf-fall-disease-spreads/,[],"BASILAN, Philippines – The provincial government on Monday, January 23, declared the province under a state of calamity after a fungus that causes a disease with no known cure spread across nearly 1,000 hectares of rubber trees in the province. The provincial board approved the declaration following a recommendation from the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (PDRRMC) which confirmed the spread of the leaf fall disease on Basilan’s rubber tree plantations. The disease, also known as the Pestalotiopsis attack, has been a major threat to rubber tree plantations in Southeast Asia. The disease causes leaves to turn yellow and fall off the tree and significant reductions in rubber yield. The Basilan Provincial Agriculturist’s Office and the Philippine Rubber Research Institute said Pestalotiopsis has so far infected around 90%, if not all, of the rubber trees in the province’s nine municipalities and two cities. Last week, Basilan Governor Jim Salliman-Hataman said at least 800 hectares of rubber trees in the province were infected. Over Basilan broadcaster DXNO-Radyo Komunidad on Monday, Salliman said experts theorized that the disease may have spread to the province from nearby Sabah, a territory being disputed by the Philippines and Malaysia. He did not elaborate. Salliman also directed local agriculturists to see if there was already a cure for the rubber tree disease that is caused by the fungus Pestalotiopsis. The disease, which can infect rubber tree trunks and cause them to die in severe cases, has been difficult to control, and there is no known cure. Initially, local officials said protocols need to be put in place in Basilan’s rubber tree plantations to prevent the disease from spreading further. In other Southeast Asian countries, efforts are being made to combat the spread of the disease. These include the use of fungicides and the development of disease-resistant strains of rubber trees. Some experts, however, said these measures may not be enough because of other factors such as climate change and monoculture farming practices. Farmers in major rubber-producing countries like Thailand and Indonesia have reported increasing cases of the disease in recent years. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/things-to-know-survival-guide-attending-concerts-philippine-arena/,[],"Since the end of the pandemic lockdowns, the concert and festival scene in the Philippines just keeps getting better. Passionate fans don’t hesitate to flock to venues, may it be open areas or huge arenas, to see their favorite artists. The Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, SMDC Festival Grounds in Parañaque, Samsung Hall in Taguig, and the New Frontier Theater, Araneta Coliseum, and North EDSA SkyDome in Quezon City are the most common performance venues for major acts. The Philippine Arena in Bulacan, meanwhile, is gaining popularity as a concert venue despite its distance from Metro Manila, but most remain unfamiliar with its ins and outs. If you’re planning to attend a concert at the Philippine Arena or still contemplating if you should even go, then, here’s what you should consider. (NOTE: These tips are all based on the writer’s personal experience; such experiences might not be the same for everyone, and it could still vary depending on the organizers of each specific concert.) Compared to the usual concert venues in Metro Manila, the Philippine Arena in Bulacan has no option for mass public transportation such as Grab, Angkas, jeepneys, or trains, which makes getting there already a big hurdle for most attendees. Make sure to iron out your mode of transportation days (and even weeks!) before the actual show dates. Lucky if you can bring a private car, but if not, best to avail of shuttle or bus services to make things easier for you. In our case, we joined a bus rental effort for when we attended SEVENTEEN’s Be The Sun Bulacan concert in December 2022 and used a private car for Harry Styles’s Love on Tour in March. Concert promoter Live Nation Philippines also organized shuttle services for attendees in their SEVENTEEN, Harry Styles, and BLACKPINK concerts. There’s several pick-up points and travel times so make sure to pick which option fits your availability. Aside from shuttle services prepared by the official organizer, several fans have also started the same initiatives months ahead of the actual show dates, with attendees being able to choose the closest pick-up points in their area. And for those planning to bring their own cars, why not start a carpool with fellow fans living close to your area? This way, you won’t be alone during the drive and you’ll be able to share expenses such as toll fees and gas. If you’re a fan looking for these bus and car rentals, best to check Twitter or Facebook groups to see if there are these initiatives near your area. After finalizing which mode of transportation you’re taking, start planning your route. There are several routes (Ciudad de Victoria Exit, Marilao Exit, and Bocaue Exit, among others) concert-goers can take, depending on where they’re coming from. Don’t forget to monitor news regarding road closures and diversions so you can change your route accordingly. According to a December 2022 post from Department of Public Works and Highways Regional Office III, the Ciudad de Victoria Southbound Exit Ramp will be temporarily closed from January 4 to March 31, 2023. So for those planning to attend the Harry Styles concert on March 14 and the BLACKPINK concert on March 25 and 26, best to take the Bocaue Exit instead when heading to the Philippine Arena. Expect heavy traffic, too, considering that an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 concert-goers will be heading to the venue. There are also only about two entrance and exit points around the arena, so expect a huge vehicle build-up both before and after the concert. Best to leave early, especially if you’re coming far from the venue, to give leeway for the hours you’ll possibly be stuck in traffic and avoid being late for the show proper. Plan your departure time depending on the time you’re supposed to be at the venue. For example, VIP Soundcheck ticket-holders are usually required to be at the concert venue before noon, while most Upper Box or General Admission ticket-holders can wait until the moment doors are expected to open. Make sure to check the organizers announcement regarding these notices so your group can adjust your plans accordingly. Best to familiarize yourself with the site map of the arena, too. Local organizers usually post a photo of it days before the concert, so make sure that you download a copy of it to help you navigate the area. The Philippine Arena area is huge and it could be overwhelming for those who are going there for the first time. Having an idea about the placement of important venues – such as the medic location, baggage counter, ticket and merchandise booth, CR, parking spots, and entrance points – would really make things smoother for you on the actual show dates. Make sure to know which vehicles are designated to which parking area, too. In our experience, small private vehicles were allowed in parking areas A to D, while buses were only allowed from parking area E onwards. Knowing where each parking area is will be really helpful, especially if you’re going back to your vehicles after the concert. Note also that the whole complex is wide and parking areas are not that close to each other.  Best to come early so that you can choose where to park and best to park near the parking exits to avoid being stuck in the build-up. Just a heads up, too, that there’s a high possibility of a post-concert gridlock traffic and your vehicle will be stuck when you’re exiting the area, as everyone’s trying to go to their respective homes after the show, so better be patient! Most concert junkies know that attending a concert can be physically exhausting (yes, even if we’re not the one dancing and singing onstage.) Many of us spend hours waiting for the actual concert, roaming around for fan-made gifts, taking photos with fellow fans, and lining up, so by the end of the show, our feet are already aching and our arms feel sore. This is why fans usually prefer to check in at nearby accommodations around the concert venue so they could rest as soon as possible after the concert and avoid that pre- and post concert traffic, instead of taking the hours-long commute home. Concert venues in Metro Manila are usually surrounded with several accommodation options, such as hotels and condominiums, which are often within walking distance. But that’s not the same case for the Philippine Arena. However, there are several places that do offer short-term stays. Do note that that these accommodation options are usually a drive away, and with the lack of public transportation at the arena complex and how late concerts usually end, it’d be hard to reach these places if you don’t have your own transport service. Best to scour Facebook groups, AirBnB, and Agoda listings and book ahead. Make sure to consider the price and the distance from the venue and find the best one that fits your needs. Make accommodation reservations early, especially that such limited options won’t be able to cater to all of the arena’s capacity. Aside from your transportation and accommodation options, it’s best to plan your food for the actual concert dates, too, as there are no nearby malls or restaurants around the area. Our advice? Better to bring your own drinks and pack your meals, instead. If you expect to be there before noon, make sure that you have food options already for your lunch, snacks, and even dinner. You can buy meals on the way and just leave them in your vehicles when you’re attending the concert. In our experience, the organizer partnered with several food establishments to have them set up stalls at the outdoor stadium near the arena during the day of the SEVENTEEN concert. However, lines for each stall were long and fans had to line up for an hour for their food. Imagine, fewer than 30 food stalls were available and there was an estimated crowd of around 40,000 – it’s no surprise that it was hard to meet the demand of the attendees. The stadium was also only accessible to ticket-holders, meaning, those who accompanied the concert-goers didn’t had a chance to buy food from the stalls prepared. Several vendors were also scattered near the parking areas, but it was mostly for drinks and snacks. During the Harry Styles concert, the food area was set near the parking areas, making it more closer and accessible to the attendees. There were also several food stalls at the lobby inside the arena, and as expected, there was a long queue of attendees ordering food when the concert was finished. At least if you brought your own meals, you won’t have to line up for so long. And you have the freedom to choose what you’d like to eat, too, as not all stalls might offer what you’re craving for. One of our friends also attempted to have food delivered instead, since she didn’t want to line up at the stalls, but decided not to push through since it was hard to figure out the exact pin location, given the vast area of the venue and the big crowd. We’d advise everyone attending a concert in Philippine Arena to make sure to have snacks or meals after the concert, especially since there’s a possibility of being stuck in traffic on your way home. But remember that most concert venues and organizers do not allow you to bring any outside food inside the bowl, so best to eat your meals before going inside the arena. Phone signals are unstable at the venue. We had Smart, Globe, Sun, and TNT SIMs, but all of them weren’t able to provide a stable connection. If social media applications – Twitter, Telegram, Messenger – are your main mode of communication for your circle of friends, best to save each other’s phone numbers instead and make sure that you have enough mobile load to text and call your friends, if needed. Make sure to agree on a meet-up place at the venue, so that you and your friends will have a place to go to in case you have a hard time reaching each other. The preparation doesn’t stop there! Here are more tips that might help you on D-day! Wear something comfortable. Promise, we know we strive to be extra for our concert OOTDs, but for a venue as huge as the Philippine Arena, trust us when we say that it’s best to put comfort and safety as your priority. We usually wear platform boots and high heels for concerts at MOA Arena or Araneta Coliseum, as we have nearby accommodations, but we traded these for rubber shoes instead for the Philippine Arena. That was a good call since we recorded 13,000 steps during the December 17 concert (imagine what would happen to us if we were wearing heels!). The complex is huuuuuge (we’ll keep on reiterating this) and attendees have no choice but to walk, walk, walk from one point to another (even tricycles are only allowed at some areas), so best to find a footwear that you’re comfortable in. Heads up, too, that Upper Box ticket holders have to climb a lot of stairs (although there’s an elevator, but there will obviously be a long line for that) to get to their seats. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to ask around if there were specific areas for persons with disabilities, but we did see several staff members assisting PWD attendees. Make sure to bring an extra top, too. Or better yet, change to your concert fits before lining up for the entrance instead and just go for casual attire if you’ll be roaming around the area for the whole day. Or you can choose to stay inside your vehicles instead of roaming around if you arrive there early to avoid getting dirty and tired. Bring necessities. Before leaving your house, double-check if your concert ticket, vaccination card, and IDs are already in your bag. You won’t be able to enter the venue proper if you don’t have any of these. Bring an umbrella and portable fans, too, since the complex is mainly an open area. Although there are some areas where there’s some shade, it can’t really accommodate a huge crowd, especially when it rains. If you have a medical condition, make sure to bring your medications, too. We usually bring over-the-counter pills for headaches, pain relief patches, mint lozenges, and Band-aids. We’re still in the middle of a pandemic so don’t forget to bring extra masks, alcohol, and tissues, too! There’s several restrooms across all levels inside the arena and the stadium, but there’s a lack of supply of toiletries, so better to bring your own hygiene kits. There were also some portalets installed outside the arena, but given the huge crowd, expect a long line for it. Also, make sure to bring cash! There are no nearby banks or ATMs around the complex and not all stalls accept credit cards or online transactions. And given the unstable mobile data, it’s best to not rely too much on online banks or cashless transactions. Don’t forget to charge your power banks, and if you can bring an extra power bank, please do so. This might sound like we’re asking you to bring a lot of things, but note that these are only essential items! Check also the guidelines posted by the organizer to make sure that you’re not bringing any item that won’t be allowed inside the venue. Behave properly. Our queuing experience was a nightmare during the December 2022 concert, but thankfully, the co-attendees I was lining up with weren’t unruly. Everyone was giving way when others were asking for space, especially when some had to leave the queue because they were already starting to get dizzy. With how chaotic and cramped the situation was, fans could have run amok, but luckily, that didn’t happen as they were just trying to help each other enter the venue. Fans were also helpful and responsive when we asked them for instructions and clarifications. Fortunately, our pre- and post- concert experience for the Harry Styles show were much better as there were signages, posters, and marshals everywhere. Admittedly, we still think that the Philippine Arena is not that concert-friendly compared to other venues in Metro Manila, but we do recognize that it has now become an option for organizers and performers who’d like to play for a bigger audience. Hopefully, though, organizers and staff will also improve their services so it will be a good experience for concert-goers. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/results-aryna-sabalenka-caroline-garcia-linda-fruhvirtova-australian-open-january-23-2023/,[],"Aryna Sabalenka eased into quarterfinals for the first time to firm as a favorite for the Australian Open title on Monday, January 23, but fourth seed Caroline Garcia was bundled out and 17-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova saw her dream run come to an end. World No. 45 Magda Linette ensured Poland would be represented in the last eight by stunning Garcia, 7-6 (3), 6-4, while Croatian Donna Vekic, ranked 64th in the world, held her nerve to down Fruhvirtova, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Vekic will next play Sabalenka and 30-year-old Linette will take on Czech former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, who breezed past China’s Zhang Shuai, 6-0, 6-4, at Kia Arena. Garcia, 29, looked set to continue the late-career renaissance that saw her reach the semifinals of the US Open and win the WTA Finals last year when she took a 3-0 lead in the first set against Linette. It all went downhill from there, though, as Linette played inspired tennis to fight her way back into the set and won it on the tiebreak. The second set was more of the same as Linette kept up her level and Garcia’s unforced error count racked up, the normally placid Frenchwoman showing her frustration with a stream of expletives that earned her a code violation. “I don’t know what happened. I’m speechless really, I don’t know what to say,” said a breathless Linette after Garcia had sent one final forehand long to hand her a place in her first Grand Slam quarter-final. With Linette’s younger compatriot and hot favorite Iga Swiatek having departed in the fourth round on Sunday, Garcia’s exit leaves Sabalenka and American Jessica Pegula as the only top 10 seeds in the quarterfinals. Sabalenka looks to have as good a chance as anyone of winning the Daphne Akhurst Trophy if she can conquer the demons that sometimes take hold when her power game is not working as well as she would like. On Monday, the 24-year-old Belarusian managed to get her head straight after going down an early break to blast Swiss Belinda Bencic off the court, 7-5, 6-2. “Definitely today I felt like I couldn’t handle her power,” said Bencic. “I think that was the biggest difference. But still, you know, I don’t feel like this is a really bad loss. Like, she’s for sure very in-form right now.” Having apparently fixed what was once the most inconsistent serve at the top of the women’s game, Sabalenka has started the season with eight straight wins and has yet to lose a set. “I want to believe that the way I’m working right now, the way I’m on the court right now, this is the new beginning,” she told reporters. Vekic also looked to be coasting to a straightforward win over Fruhvirtova after wrapping up the opening set with an ace but the Czech has been confounding her olders and betters throughout her fairytale campaign. The teenager showed maturity beyond her years in key moments in the second set and played almost flawless tennis to even up the contest, sending Vekic scurrying for a bathroom break to regather herself. It worked, and although Fruhvirtova continued to challenge her serve, the 26-year-old fended her off to secure a spot in the Melbourne Park quarterfinals for the first time in 11 attempts. “It feels pretty good, I would say,” said an emotional Vekic. “I didn’t really really feel that I had much control in the second set but I knew that I had to keep fighting, hoping and believing that I would win.” Nine-time men’s champion Novak Djokovic and his injured hamstring will be in the spotlight when he takes on Australian Alex de Minaur in the night session at the Rod Laver Arena. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/beyond-tokyo-osaka-how-spend-your-trip-central-japan-guide/,[],"Nagoya, the capital of Aichi Prefecture, is Japan’s fourth most populated city. Air raids during World War II ravaged the city and its important historic buildings. Fast forward to today, Nagoya and the region is home to major Japanese manufacturing companies such as Toyota, MORI SEIKI CO., LTD., DAIDO METAL CO., LTD and others. It may not draw the same number of tourists as Osaka and Tokyo, but the city and its nearby regions are worth the visit. Nagoya can also serve as a jump-off point to some of Japan’s scenic and quaint small towns. Filipinos will need to acquire a visa first before traveling to Japan. These are some of the basic requirements: You can also view the list of complete requirements here. After gathering the required documents, submit your application through an accredited travel agency. Here’s a list. You can also get more information by checking out the Embassy of Japan’s website. It’s easy to get into Nagoya from Manila because there are direct flights operated by Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines. Both companies often have seat sales. Book your flights in advance to get the lowest possible prices. Alternatively, you can reach Nagoya by train or bus from Tokyo. The bus company Willer Express has regular trips to Nagoya from Tokyo with a one-way ticket starting at JPY3,000+++. The trip takes around five hours. The shinkansen can get you to Nagoya faster but are more expensive. The Nozomi, Hikari, and Kodama trains serve the Tokyo-Nagoya route. The fare for the bullet trains is around JPY10,560+++. If you have a Japan Rail Pass, you could only use it for the Hikari and Kodama trains. You can check train schedules here. Like many other cities in Japan, Nagoya has an extensive network of buses and metro lines that take people form point A to point B efficiently. The Meguru Loop Bus is tailor-made for foreign tourists because it connects visitors to many of the city’s attractions. The fare for the bus is JPY210 one way but you can purchase a day pass for JPY500. The subway is also a convenient way to explore the city. Purchase a 24-hour subway pass for JPY760 or a 1-day bus and subway pass for JPY870 to save money while taking public transportation. This itinerary includes not just Nagoya but also other places such as Takayama, Shirakawago, and Matsumoto. *This assumes you start with one full day. Day 1 Begin your day with a trip to the city’s most prominent landmark, Nagoya Castle. The latter was constructed during the early years of the Edo Period. It served as one of the seats of power of the Tokugawa family’s rule. The castle is one of the biggest in the country. The structure you see now only dates to 1959 as it is a reconstruction of the complex destroyed by bombings in 1945. Make your way to the Osu Kannon Buddhist temple. Tokugawa Ieyasu had the temple relocated to its current site from Gifu in 1612. The structures you’ll see are current reconstructions of the original. The temple contains Kannon’s, the goddess of mercy, wooden statue. Not too far from Nagoya Station is the city’s highest building, Midland Square. You might want to go up to the Sky Promenade to get bird’s eye views of the city. The building also has restaurants, cafes, shops, and a cinema. Spend a chill afternoon hanging out in Sakae, the city’s downtown district. Here you’ll find several malls, restaurants, and department stores. Other landmarks in the area include the Mirai Tower, Oasis 21, Hisaya Odori Park, and Sunshine Sakae. Attractions you might be interested in include the SCMAGLEV and Railway Park, Tokugawa Art Museum, and the Nagoya City Science Museum. Entrance fees: Day 2 Take a break from the city with a trip to Hida-Takayama in Gifu. During Japan’s feudal epoch, Takayama had some of the best timber and carpenters. The two became the main sources of income for the city and are the reasons for its prosperity. There isn’t much to do here other than chill and soak in the ambiance of the rural and mountainous area. The well-preserved old town is Takayama’s main draw. Here you’ll find many of the centuries old houses and buildings intact. Walking along the streets is like peeking into ancient Japan. The city is famous for its sake, make sure to get a drink in one of the breweries before leaving. There are paid attractions in the old town if you’re inclined to enter them such as the Takayama Jinya, Fuji Art Gallery, Takayama Showa Museum, and the Kusakabe Heritage House, just to name a few. If you’re in Takayama during spring (April 14-15) and autumn (October 9-10), you’ll see and experience one of the most renowned festivals in the country known as the Sanno Festival in spring and the Hachiman Festival in autumn. How to get to Takayama By train: There are regular JR Hida limited express trains that take around 2.5 hours one way from Nagoya to Takayama. The fare is approximately JPY6,000. By bus: JR, Nohi, Willer, and Meitetsu companies operate direct buses between Nagoya and Takayama. The bus ride takes approximately 2.5 hours. You can purchase a one-way ticket for JPY3,100 or a round-trip ticket for JPY5,400. You must make the return trip within 4 days from the day of your outward trip for the ticket to remain valid. Entrance fees: Day 3 Shirakawa-go is a possible day trip from Takayama. Shirakawa-go is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is famous for its traditional farmhouses that resemble hands in prayer. The most famous village that many tourists visit is Ogimachi. Some of the houses in the quaint village are more than two centuries old. The design and materials used for building the houses can withstand harsh winters. A visit here will provide you with a glimpse of ancient farm life. Many of the houses you’ll see during your visit are now restaurants, guesthouses, and museums. You have the option to spend the night in the village to immerse yourself in the atmosphere. Go up to Shiroyama Viewpoint to get overlooking views of the village’s quaint houses. You can visit some of the houses/museums for a fee. How to get to Shirakawa-go By bus: Nohi Bus has frequent buses connecting Takayama and Shirakawa-go. A round trip ticket costs JPY4,600. You can check schedules here. Entrance fees: Day 4 Leave as early as possible to Matsumoto from Takayama. The trip takes a few hours, leaving early provides you with enough time to see the city’s highlights. Matsumoto is one of the biggest cities in Japan’s Nagano Prefecture. It has a laid back vibe and isn’t as intimidating as bigger cities like Tokyo and Osaka. It’s easy to explore on foot as well. The main reason for your visit is to see Matsumoto Castle. The latter is considered one of the country’s prettiest original castles. The castle dates to the 16th century. The castle grounds are a popular spot for cherry blossom viewing, but the castle is lovely regardless of the season. Make sure to return to the castle at night. If you’re interested in art, visit the Matsumoto City Museum of Art. The museum’s main exhibits are by Yayoi Kusama and other artists associated with Matsumoto. Go shopping or just take a leisurely stroll around Nakamachi, the city’s old merchant district. How to get to Matsumoto By bus: Nohi Bus and Alpico have regular buses that connect Takayama and Matsumoto. The bus fare is around JPY3,500 one way. You can check bus schedules here. Entrance fees: Day 5 If you have time to spare and have a bigger budget, you can go on a day trip to Kamikochi. The latter is a beautiful park with scenic walking and hiking trails. You’ll need a train and bus connection to reach Kamikochi in around 1.5 hours one way. From Matsumoto Station, board a train bound for Shin-Shimashima Station. Then hop on a bus to Kamikochi. The fare for the one-way trip costs around JPY2,710. You could also take the direct buses, but these are infrequent. Take the bus from Matsumoto back to Nagoya. The fare is approximately JPY3,400 to JPY4,400+++ depending on the day of departure. If you decide to visit Kamikochi, you can catch the buses departing at 5:30 pm onwards. You can check schedules here. Day 6 Depending on the time of your flight, you still have a few hours in Nagoya. You could spend that time revisiting some places, hanging out in your favorite spots in the city, and/or shopping before leaving. A budget of roughly JPY11,000 or P4,500 a day allows you to follow the itinerary above. This also covers a bed in a hostel dorm, one or two paid attractions per city, taking public transportation, and most of your meals from convenience stores (with the occasional restaurant). You could spend more or less depending on your interests and if you go shopping. Sky’s the limit in Japan if you have the budget to splurge. Japan isn’t a budget destination, but you can still find ways to save money. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/apple-targets-raising-india-production-share-minister/,[],"NEW DELHI, India – Apple wants India to account for up to 25% of its production from about 5%-7% now, the trade minister told a conference on Monday, January 23, as the iPhone maker continues to move its manufacturing away from China. “Apple, another success story,” Piyush Goyal said, pitching India as a competitive manufacturing destination. “They are already at about 5-7% of their manufacturing in India. If I am not mistaken, they are targeting to go up to 25% of their manufacturing. They launched the most recent models from India, manufactured in India.” Goyal did not say when Apple wants to meet the target. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron and later with Foxconn, in line with the Indian government’s push for local manufacturing. Foxconn plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, sources told Reuters late last year. Ashwini Vaishnaw, Indian’s electronics and information technology minister, tweeted on Monday that Apple’s exports from India had hit $1 billion in December. China’s COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions, and rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, have influenced Apple’s plans to shift production elsewhere. J.P.Morgan analysts estimated last year that a quarter of all Apple products would be made outside China by 2025, from 5% currently. – Rappler.com"

Burrow guided the Bengals to 412 yards of total offense, 30 first downs, and zero turnovers behind a commanding performance from the offensive line. “Complete game from everybody – offense, defense, and special teams,” said Burrow, who threw for 242 yards and two touchdowns. “Domination from start to finish. That’s what we expected.” On the other side of the ball, the Bengals’ defense made life difficult for Josh Allen and the Bills offense, who converted just 5 of 12 third downs and never found a rhythm. “But the job’s not finished,” Burrow said. “We have another big one on the road next week. Excited for it.” The Bengals will return next Sunday to Kansas City for a rematch of last year’s AFC Championship game against the Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, which the Bengals won 27-24 in an overtime thriller. Had the Bills prevailed on Sunday, the AFC Championship game would have been played at the neutral site of Atlanta, and the Bengals took great motivation from the fact that tickets were already being sold for a potential Bills-Chiefs matchup. “You better get those refunds,” Burrow said with a grin. Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon praised his quarterback for living up to his nickname of “Joe Cool” in Sunday’s pressure-packed game. “Joe Burrow was unbelievable,” Mixon said. “In games like this he always rises to the occasion and so do our teammates. Under the brightest lights, we shine even brighter,” he said.

The breakdown began at 7:34 am (0234 GMT; 10:34 am Philippine time) when a voltage fluctuation in the grid occurred between the cities of Jamshoro and Dadu in southern Sindh province, power minister Khurrum Dastagir said. “There was a fluctuation in voltage and the systems were shut down one by one. This is not a major crisis,” Dastagir told Geo TV news channel. Outages were reported in the southern port city of Karachi, the capital Islamabad, the eastern city of Lahore and Peshawar in the north. Mohammad Asim, a spokesman for Peshawar’s Lady Reading Hospital, the largest hospital in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said back up generators were used to provide uninterrupted electricity for the emergency ward, intensive care units, and laboratories. The power ministry issued a statement saying that work was ongoing to revive the system, and the minister said that electricity had been restored in some parts of the country. Pakistan has enough power installed capacity to meet the demand, especially in winter, when it mostly has a surplus. But the country lacks resources to run its oil and gas powered plants and the sector is heavily in debt, and inadequate investment in infrastructure and power lines has resulted in the National Grid suffering frequent breakdowns. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/governor-adiong-jr-warning-flying-voters-lanao-del-sur/,[],"LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines – Lanao del Sur Governor Mamintal Adiong Jr. on Saturday, January 21, called on the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to stop the ongoing voter registration in his province due to concerns about “flying voters.” Adiong said that instead of registering young voters, adults from other areas, mostly non-Maranaos, had been coming to be listed as voters in the Muslim-majority Lanao del Sur before the registration deadline. He said he wanted the registration to be for new voters who were 18 years old and lived in the province, and not for non-residents. Adiong expressed disappointment that the Comelec had been registering many new Lanao del Sur voters from Maguindanao, Iligan City, and Cagayan de Oro City. He warned of potential electoral cheating through “flying voters,” and urged the Comelec to purge Lanao del Sur’s voter list if it was serious about cleaning it. Adiong said he does not want Lanao del Sur and Marawi City to become known for cheating, and that the national government’s help is needed to change this. Adiong said the number of Lanao del Sur voters – some 689,000 – in the 2022 elections was already high, and the Comelec had been registering even more. There are many Maranaos, he said, who live in other places like Baguio and they don’t go home anymore. Rey Sumalipao, Comelec director for the Bangsamoro region, said allegations of double registrations need to be substantiated first. He said the best way to address the allegations of double registrations would be to provide them with a list of these non-resident voters so that exclusion proceedings could start. Sumalipao said the Comelec wants to purge the voter’s list but cannot do anything unless those who make the allegations go beyond mere assertions and show proof. The Comelec, he said, needs the help of those who have evidence of double registrations to be able to address this issue. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/politics-mars-search-jose-rizal-memorial-state-university-head-dapitan/,[],"ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE, Philippines – The government-owned Jose Rizal Memorial State University (JRMSU) in Dapitan City is still without a university president, with some members of the search committee blaming political meddling for the failure of the institution’s board of regents to elect one earlier in January. They expressed dismay over what they described as the board’s alleged disregard of the selection process, resulting in the election failure. The Dapitan-based JRMSU, which has five campuses and an extension in Zamboanga del Norte, has been without a president since April 2022, and it will likely be without a head for another year. Lawyer Uldarico Mejorada II, a member of the search committee representing the private sector, said on Sunday, January 22, that he was “dismayed that all our hard work for almost a year went to naught.” Patrick Galleto, another member of the five-person committee, said they disqualified two of six aspirants for the university’s presidency, but then the “board reversed our decision and reinstated a disqualified applicant.” The search committee had disqualified Zamboanga State College for Marine Sciences and Technology director Cesar Reyes and Commission on Higher Education-Zamboanga Peninsula Regional Director Rody Garcia for “lack of experience in administrative service.” But during a meeting in Zamboanga City on December 14, 2022, the board of regents accepted Reyes back, citing his experience as the director for corporate affairs of the Zamboanga State College. The other applicants for the position were Cesar Estrope, Jay Telen, Quindhe Banquiao, and Ana Liza Lopez. “Disqualifying and qualifying an applicant is the job of the search committee, not the university governing board, which job is to elect a president from the three shortlisted aspirants that we submit,” said Galleto. He said there was talk going around that faculty and JRMSU student regents were offered favors, and a local political group met with members of the board about the university presidency. Galleto said the failed election reeked of politics. A local politician allegedly supported Reyes and then switched to Estrope. Another political group identified with an influential Zamboanga City-based political family allegedly supported Reyes. The search committee chair, CHED Executive Director Cinderella Filipina Jaro, declined to comment, saying that queries “would be best addressed by the governing board.” However, JRMSU Board chair, CHED Commissioner Jo Mark Libre, refused to answer Rappler’s 14 phone calls on January 20 and 21. The JRMSU board held the election for a university president in Zamboanga City on January 11, but Libre’s chief of staff, Stephanie Conde, said that “it was declared [a] failure because nobody got the majority votes.” The search committee was dissolved, and the board ordered another round of search by a new set of search committee members. Galleto said he was worried that the JRMSU would be left without a president for another year. He called on the JRMSU board of regents to shield itself from “politics and other personal interests” because “we are in the academe.” “The regents must be discerning and set a good example to its faculty and students. They must go above political polarization and be professional in choosing our next president,” Galleto said. – Rappler.com"

With the win, Brooklyn completed a two-game sweep of the season series against the Warriors. Irving won a scoring duel with Stephen Curry 38-26 and got a lot more help from his fellow starters as the Nets won their second straight after beginning their five-game trip with back-to-back losses. Surviving the potential embarrassment of continual intentional fouling on him, Nic Claxton made six of his 15 foul shots en route to a 24-point, 15-rebound double-double for Brooklyn, which was playing once again without an injured Kevin Durant. After leading for most of the first half, only to see the Nets draw even in the third quarter, the Warriors used superior play from their bench to build a 110-98 advantage on a Jonathan Kuminga layup with 5:42 remaining. The Nets dominated the finish, however, using a nine-point burst that featured 7 points from Claxton to get within arm’s length, then a Joe Harris three-pointer to pull into a 112-all tie with 1:52 to go. Two free throws by Curry gave the Warriors one last lead at 116-115 with 1:12 to go, but O’Neal turned Irving’s ninth assist into the biggest hoop of the night. The star guard then hit his two foul shots after Klay Thompson’s attempt at a go-ahead three-pointer was off the mark with 20.1 seconds left. O’Neale finished with 16 points, Harris 14 points, and Seth Curry 12 for the Nets, who got 99 points from their starters. Another starter, Ben Simmons, added a game-high 11 assists and 7 points to the cause. The Nets’ bench chipped in with just 21 points, which was one more than Kuminga had for the Warriors on a four-man reserve crew that totaled 50 points. Kevon Looney (14 points) and Donte DiVincenzo (13) also scored in double figures off the Golden State bench, while starters Jordan Poole and Thompson had 17 and 10 points, respectively. Looney completed a double-double with 10 rebounds, while DiVincenzo had a team-high 8 assists. Draymond Green contributed 9 points, 11 rebounds, and 7 assists to the loss, which was Golden State’s fourth straight at home. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/digital-lending-apps-growth-time-spent-2022/,['VICTOR BARREIRO JR.'],"A January 2023 analysis by digital financing company Digido found increased growth in the adoption of digital lending applications on Android and iOS in the Philippines in 2022, as well as increased time spent on these applications. The analysis took into account 10 specific digital lending platforms with mobile apps on Android and/or iOS. According to Digido, the 10 apps saw “a combined total of 14.2 million downloads as of the end of December 2022, representing 3.4% of the total downloads from their respective Finance category across all devices and all platforms.” When compared to December 2021 figures, an additional 3.7 million people downloaded online lending apps in the country. Digido noted there were 2.3 million active users among those 10 platforms by the end of December 2022, representing an increase of 1.2 million when compared to November 2021 figures. The estimate points to 3.2% (or about every 30th adult Filipino) using one of the platforms at least once monthly. While Cashalo is said to have the largest market share among the 10 applications, GoodKredit (+703%), Digido (+177%), and Plentina (+115%) grew the most in terms of newcomers being onboarded onto their mobile applications. Digido saw the longest average duration of time spent on its app, at about 28 minutes per month. The average monthly duration of usage session of these apps was at 12 minutes and 46 seconds with users spending about one minute and 14 seconds in a single session. That said, active Philippine users were on digital lending apps for a total of about 75,305 hours in 2022. The analysis also noted what it called “significant bursts of user login activity” in March, July, and November of 2022, with Digido noting these would be mainly due to the lending platforms working with small and medium-sized businesses. It added the surges in activity could have also been caused by promotions, favorable conditions, or the launch of specialized loan products for entrepreneurs. “Our recent analysis of select digital lending services is a clear indication that responsible credit services continue to be an effective means of breaching inequality in accessing financial tools. We encourage the wider segment to continue in promoting responsible lending,” Digido country manager Farit Shakirov said in a press statement. Digido added in its analysis that micro, small, and medium enterprises were still underfunded and thus limited in their ability to further grow. This, the company said, “increases the potential for the penetration of digital lending platforms.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/everything-pinoy-needs-climb-mount-kilimanjaro/,[],"Four in the morning, pitch-black, and it’s 20 degrees below zero. There’s iced snot on my face but I don’t care. The world is limited to what my headlamp illuminates, all movement restricted by six layers of clothing. I crane my neck at a column of headlamps extending to the stars. The gradient’s so steep I can’t discern where the headlamps end and where the stars begin. For a while there’s no sound but the crunch of our team’s boots on frozen ice. The wind starts to howl. Up here, the climate swings faster than a Pinoy politician before an election. Has it been six hours since we started climbing? Ten? Suddenly our “Kilifighters” – tough mountain guides who surround and constantly encourage us – break into a lively Swahili song. Welcome travelers,
To Kilimanjaro, the towering mountain,
Just walk slowly, no problem,
Like a snake, coil around her,
And you’ll summit safely. I fantasize of a fiesta waiting at the top, with steaming lechon, adobo, taho, and everything else that’s hot and warm. I check my watch. Eight hours since we left Barafu, the dry and icy basecamp where we stashed most of our gear. We don’t stop – at this elevation, it’s tantamount to rapid body heat loss. I glance at my teammates and they too are trying to survive the freezing winds. Gradually the dawn reveals a windswept world of rock, of ice. There. Up ahead, a final push away, lies the shoulder of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa and one of the world’s Seven Summits. Gritting our teeth, we climb. Mt. Kilimanjaro is one of the planet’s most iconic mountains, so popular it’s in the intro of The Lion King. It towers over northern Tanzania, near the Kenyan border in a slice of Africa known to geologists as the Great Rift Valley. In actuality, Kilimanjaro is an extinct volcano that rises 19,341 feet (5,895 meters) – almost twice the height of Mt. Apo, which at 9,692 feet (2,954 meters), is the highest peak in the Philippines. Fortunately, Kilimanjaro hasn’t blown her top in 360,000 years, almost before Juan Ponce Enrile was born. Dubbed as “The White Mountain,” Mt. Kilimanjaro is one of the world’s Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. The other summits include Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Elbrus in Europe, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, plus either Kosciuszko in Australia under the Bass list or Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia under the Messner list. Just half of the roughly 35,000 climbers who attempt to scale Kilimanjaro’s sheer slopes succeed, but you don’t need to be a rope-toting Sherpa to do it. For the average Filipino, summiting Kilimanjaro just requires years of saving, months of preparation, and anywhere from 5-10 days of steady climbing. Many Pinoys have successfully reached her frozen rim. You can too with these tips. 1.  Choose your own adventure. Your preferred route and outfitter might very well determine how enjoyable and successful your trip will be. We chose Top Climbers Expeditions, a company run by pros with a solid success rate for summiting the mountain (we all made it). From the Philippines, you’ll fly nearly 10,000 kilometers to Dar es Salaam, the quaint, seaside capital of Tanzania. For a slice of local flavor and culture, we recommend exploring its markets, museums, and ivory beaches before flying to the jump-off cities of Arusha or Moshi, some 600 kilometers away. There are seven established routes up Mt. Kilimanjaro and two trails for descending and resupplying expeditions. They vary from easy Marangu, where climbers can sleep in huts, to the more brutal and direct Umbwe Route. “We chose and highly recommend the Lemosho Route, the most scenic trail with the highest summit success rate due to its gradual ascent. We measured the route at around 70 kilometers which takes about eight days to complete, from the jump-off at Lemosho Gate to its conclusion at Mweka Gate,” explains Rofil Sheldon Magto, leader of our successful expedition. Over eight days, you and your climb-kada will pass through cool pine plantations, misty cloud forests, wet moorlands, dry alpine deserts and the frozen alpine zone, where sun rays and wind dance like fire and ice. While Kilimanjaro can be climbed year-round, the driest and safest climbing windows would either be from December to mid-March or from July to October. Climbing in the wet season means slogging through heavy snowfall and slushy mud – not much fun and not too safe for you or your guides. Leave ample leeway when crafting your itinerary, adding extra days to anticipate instances when flights are interrupted, delayed, or missed. Some of our teammates were stuck for three days in another country when a freak snowstorm canceled the region’s connecting flights. Worse, they weren’t issued entry VISAs, so they had to survive at the airport like Tom Hanks in The Terminal. 2. Pick your climb-kada wisely. “When high-altitude sickness, crazy physical challenges, and inclement weather set in, you’ll be grateful for the company of your most trusted climbing buddies,” explains Rofil. “They’ll inspire you and your team to reach the summit, while taking care of you when you aren’t feeling well physically, mentally, and emotionally. They’ll also probably laugh when you fall flat on your butt! Kilimanjaro is no walk in the park so you should look for buddies with similar goals. Climbers who you’ll enjoy trekking with, who’ve got your back no matter what happens.” 3. Save up. Prepare a realistic budget. Your two biggest expenses would be round-trip flights from the Philippines to Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania, plus the cost of your climbing outfitter. “Be wary of cheaper outfitters, which may scrimp on vital services,” warns Rofil. Kilimanjaro isn’t cheap, but it’s far more affordable than the other Seven Summits. A budget of P200,000 ($3.6K) should be enough to cover a climber’s roundtrip flights, travel and climb insurances, visas, accommodations, food, tips and pasalubong. “Don’t bring P200,000 or its USD equivalent in cash to reduce overall risk. Africa – like any place on Earth – is not bereft of crime. Pay for what you can in advance, bring secure credit and debit cards, and stash your physical cash in various bags.” Lastly, remember that Africa is a region where tipping is highly appreciated. Our team of six climbers pooled together our resources to give each of our 22 porters and guides a fair tip. Tipping generously not only helps hardworking Africans provide for their families – it builds a good image of us Pinoy climbers. 4. Logistics, logistics, logistics. This is the most critical part of your trip and one you should pore over again and again. “It may seem daunting and complex because it’s an international climb, so try to secure as many requirements ahead of time. Plane tickets, hotel accommodations, and climb slots all fluctuate in price and availability so book them as soon as you can,” says Rofil. “Secure your visas immediately and don’t forget to get travel and outdoor insurance.” You can secure your visas here while getting trip and climb insurance here. Remember that clearing African immigration requires mandatory vaccines. Aside from complete COVID shots with boosters, you’ll need vaccines for yellow fever, malaria, typhoid, polio, diphtheria, hepatitis A and B, and tetanus. Many of these can be obtained from larger hospitals or from your local Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ). Secure these shots months ahead and remember to keep your yellow BOQ vaccination passbook with you at all times. Always remember to check Tanzania’s official website as vaccination requirements may change over time. 5. Gear up. Buy, repair or modify your equipment ahead of time from reputable places like Decathlon and ROX. Insulated shoes, a down jacket, gloves, ear protectors, and shades are must-haves. “Don’t hesitate to invest in quality gear because your life and limb will depend on it. Merino wool for instance works great as a base layer,” recommends Pinoy mountaineer Dr. Gideon Lasco, who summited Kilimanjaro in 2011 and has since scaled numerous international peaks. “Good trekking poles can ease knee strain while making your downhill treks easier. Every part of your body must be protected from the elements. I highly recommend bringing lip balm with SPF, polarized sunglasses with UV protection, a buff or scarf to protect your ears and neck, plus multiple layers of gloves to keep your fingers warm.” Redundancies can save your life. I made the mistake of bringing a water bladder on summit day. Though my body heat kept the bladder itself from freezing solid, the water inside the drinking hose froze solid. Fortunately, I brought along an extra two liters of water in tumblers. Most outfitters will also let you rent gear for the climb. Don’t scrimp, especially on cold weather equipment. Rent thermal sleeping bags, which are worth their weight in gold. If you thought your fuzzy sleeping bag was warm at the top of Mount Pulag, imagine what it will feel like at 20 degrees below zero. Proper gear spells the difference between a good night’s rest and silent suffering until sunrise. Remember to pack some good, old-fashioned Pinoy food, guaranteed treats after weeks of African fare. One of our trip’s best moments was when our teammates Grace, Isoy, Andrei, and Yelena broke out cans of Pinoy dinuguan, sardinas, and bagoong. For a while our mess tent truly became home. 6. Train like a beast. Ensure you have strong legs and a solid core. Endure harsh, almost ridiculous conditions when training to build mental grit. Climbing is mostly a mental game, particularly on summit day when you’ll be climbing 18 or more hours in a single day. Climb and bond with your team to know each other’s personalities, strengths, and limitations. Our team did conditioning through a series of minor climbs in Rizal, Batangas, and Laguna. Rofil, Yelena, and Andrei complemented climbing with Ultimate Frisbee while Grace went for long bike rides. My training was endless running, weights, and carrying my little boy plus a 50-pound pack up and down a mountain in Rizal in the full heat of summer. 7. Polé Polé. You’ll hear this term passed on along the trail. Literally “slowly, slowly
in Swahili, this approach will maximize your chances of avoiding altitude sickness and physical injury. Climbing slow and steady allows your body to gradually acclimatize to both colder temperatures and higher elevations where there’s less oxygen for your body to absorb. Altitude sickness is the top reason people fail to summit the mountain and it’s not to be trifled with. “Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a syndrome characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance which stems from being exposed to a hypoxic or oxygen-poor environment,” explains Dr. John Lei, a professional expedition doctor. “Climbers are always at risk from AMS upon breaching 8,000 feet or 2,400 meters. “Higher altitudes might lead to the more serious condition known as High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), characterized by altered consciousness, abnormal movements or even a coma. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) is another serious condition where fluid accumulates in climbers’ lungs. The best solution for all of these is to immediately descend. Supplemental oxygen and medications such as acetazolamide, paracetamol, and ibuprofen will also help.” Polé Polé, deep breathing, drinking lots of fluids, eating high-carb food, and getting a good night’s rest after each trekking day is your best chance of avoiding altitude sickness. If you really want to be sure, you can take a few pills of Diamox or acetazolamide to reduce its effects. You can usually find Diamox and other mountaineering medicines in Arusha, the jump-off city for your climb. 8. Enjoy every step. “Reaching the summit is your goal, but don’t forget that your journey is as important as your destination. The whole experience is your reward for your months or years of planning and preparation. Once you set foot on the mountain, allow yourself to experience what nature has to offer. Bask in the morning sun, feel the cool breeze, listen to the sound of the forest, and appreciate the beautiful wildlife you might see along the trail. This is an opportunity for you to be fully present, so take things slowly. Take the time you need to find that inner peace,” shares Rofil. 9. Capture fleeting moments. “Don’t forget to bring your camera, a lightweight tripod, enough memory cards, and three or more rechargeable batteries. Snap all the photos you want and take as many candid photos to record the moments that truly made your trip meaningful. Ensure your gear is weather-proof and back up your photos once you have access to your laptop or the web when you return to the city,” says Rofil. “The last thing you’d want is to lose your precious photos and videos because of lost, low-quality, or damaged memory cards. Ouch!” 10. Pasalubong and side trips. The African continent offers travelers an endless array of pasalubong options – from food to clothing, to trinkets and tribal weapons. You’ll have ample time to pick up a few mementos from your once-in-a-lifetime trip after you summit the mountain. Souvenir stores will be ready as soon as you arrive in both Dar es Salaam and Arusha. Your Climb Outfitter should also make a short stop at a good souvenir shop upon your descent from the mountain. “Some of these shops sell Tanzanite – glittering blue jewels which are found only in Tanzania, considered up to a thousand times rarer than diamonds,” adds Rofil. “If you have extra cash, you might want to buy a stone or two as Tanzanite is much cheaper in Tanzania than anywhere else. Ask your guides to help you haggle for a good discount.” Should you decide to continue your adventure after your climb, then the possibilities are endless. You can go on safari a day or so after you descend. You can cross over to neighboring Kenya to meet the Maasai and Samburu people. You can travel north to Ethiopia to sip authentic coffee. You can even dive in the coral reefs of Zanzibar or the Great African Rift Lakes which host colorful freshwater cichlids. Remember, “safari” is Swahili for “adventure” – and your adventure doesn’t necessarily need to stop after summiting the mountain. Nearly 12 hours after setting out, we finally reach Stella Point, the crater rim. From atop, we gaze down at the crater floor, blanketed by a vast field of jagged ice. The wind is brutal. I dash to the front of the column to snap pictures but gasp for breath after a few steps. Oxygen here – even after two weeks of acclimatizing – is at 9% or less than half of the 21% that we breathe in the Philippines. All I can do is Polé Polé – the second-most important local saying for climbers (the first being Hakuna Matata or “no worries”) – behind everyone else. One breath, one step at a time, we march slowly to the summit of Kilimanjaro. It’s just 600 feet away, but with thin air, it takes nearly an hour to get there. Eventually we reach frozen Uhuru Peak to unveil three stars and a sun. As we raise the Philippine flag – decades of dreaming, years of saving, and months of training – finally pay off. Up here at the Golden Roof of Africa we are – for a few glorious minutes – the highest people on an entire continent. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/zubiri-says-senate-may-pass-maharlika-investment-fund-after-holy-week-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – With pressure from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the Senate may pass the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) bill after the Holy Week break, according to Senate President Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri. “Alam mo naman kapag hiningi po ng Pangulo iyan, hindi naman maganda na i-snub natin po ‘yung Pangulo (When the President asks for something, it wouldn’t be nice to snub him). We cannot snub him,” Zubiri said in a radio interview with DWIZ on Saturday, January 21. “Maganda naman ang kaniyang adhikain (He is aspiring for something good).” Introduced only in late November, the Maharlika fund proposal steamrolled past Congress on December 15, 2022, after Marcos certified it as urgent. The upper chamber is expected to begin discussions on the controversial sovereign wealth fund now that Senator Mark Villar has filed a counterpart bill, which has been described as similar to the House-approved version. Asked about the progress of the proposal, Zubiri said it might clear the Senate committee on banks before the Senate adjourns for the Holy Week break on March 23. The committee on banks, financial institutions, and currencies is also chaired by Villar. “Sa tingin ko mga (I think) after Holy Week break for third and final approval, and then of course [there will be] discussions on bicameral conference committees,” Zubiri added. Congress adjourns from March 25 to May 7. Zubiri said Villar would do well in leading discussions on the proposal, given that he has been joining Marcos’ frequent international trips. “Kasama naman niya palagi si Presidente kapag umikot sa abroad, sa mga presidential trips and visits, at pinag-uusapan nila ang Maharlika fund, so I think he is well-adapted and he is well-versed on the need [for] the Maharlika fund. At gusto namin siyang tanungin kung ano ba ang plano niya dito sa wealth fund na ito,” he said. (He’s always with the President as they make the rounds abroad on these presidential trips and visits, and they discuss the Maharlika fund, so I think he is well-adapted, and he is well-versed on the need for the Maharlika fund. And we want to ask him what his plans are for this wealth fund.) The Senate President also urged Villar to call a committee hearing at “the soonest possible time.” Zubiri clarified that the version of the bill approved by the House may still undergo several amendments as it makes its way through the Senate. Among these are the proposed changes worked out by Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda ahead of the President’s “soft launch” of the Maharlika fund in Davos. If the Senate were to consider these amendments, the Maharlika fund may become more private-led, with a key source of funding coming from an initial public offering (IPO) through the local stock market. Salceda estimated that this could “easily raise” as much as P1.2 trillion and make the government own less than 50% of the fund. Zubiri said the Senate would consider the option to allow an IPO for the investment fund. He said using private capital could grow the fund at less risk for government financial institutions, which were originally tapped to provide the fund’s seed capital. Allowing private investors part of the fund may also give markets a chance to question and analyze the decisions of the Maharlika Investment Corporation, according to Enrico Villanueva, a senior lecturer of economics at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. In addition, having the Maharlika Investment Corporation listed on the stock exchange would also compel it to submit regular disclosures and audited financial statements – just like other public companies. “It would be similar to how publicly listed corporations are answerable not only to shareholders, but also to regulators and the public at large. Same regulatory and reporting standards should apply,” Villanueva told Rappler on Monday, January 23. However, Zubiri raised concerns about Salceda’s proposal to source initial funds from the dividends of government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs). Salceda had previously given assurances that since these were dividends, they were, by nature, “real surpluses.” But Zubiri clarified that redirecting dividends to the fund would still mean taking them away from the national budget. “If you get the dividends of GOCCs, remember hindi na po idedeposit sa National Treasury iyan. Ibig sabihin hindi na maipapasama iyan sa income ng gobyerno ‘pag pinag-uusapan natin ang panukalang General Appropriations Act (they won’t be deposited into the National Treasury anymore. That means we won’t include them in the government’s income when we discuss the General Appropriations Act),” Zubiri said. Those sentiments were echoed by Senate ways and means committee chairman Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, who said the loss of dividends from the National Treasury would indirectly affect available funding for projects. “Kung kukunin sa GOCC ay hindi na ‘yan mapupunta sa general fund. Kapag hindi napunta sa general funding o sa GAA, sa general appropriations, hindi na natin magagastos ‘yan sa pagpapagawa ng eskuwelahan, pagpapagawa ng kalsada, pagbibili ng medisina,” he said in a DZBB radio interview on Sunday, January 22. (If you take them from the GOCC, they will no longer go to the general fund. When they don’t go to the general funding or the GAA, or general appropriations, we can’t use them to fund the construction of schools and roads, to buy medicine.) From a legal perspective, the dividends from government corporations are also not considered surpluses by themselves, cautioned retired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio, since they are meant to be added to the government’s total revenue. “Based on the One Fund Concept as written in several laws, the dividends of GOCCs are not surpluses since the dividends are consolidated with all other government revenues to arrive at the total government revenues for the fiscal year, against which will be deducted all the authorized government expenditures under the GAA. The net amount will either be the surplus or deficit,” Carpio told Rappler on Saturday. With hearings on the MIF set to start in the Senate soon, Zubiri said they will be focusing on adding enough safeguards to prevent corruption and preserve the original development purpose of the fund. “Importante lang lagyan natin ng safeguards para hindi maging prone to corruption…. And ang importante dito ay ang puno’t dulo nitong panukalang ito ay mapalago o mapaganda niya ang ekonomiya ng ating bansa through development programs,” he said. (It’s important that we put enough safeguards so that it doesn’t become prone to corruption. And what’s important here is that the end goal will be to enhance our country’s economy through development programs.) Villanueva also agreed that good governance is needed for the fund to succeed. A step toward that would be ensuring the integrity of the fund’s board of directors. “Unfortunately, we differ from either the Singapore model or even the Indonesian model in terms of the board structure. Here, we have a very politicized board, a 15-man board, 10 of which are within the ambit of influence of the secretary of finance,” he said in an interview on ANC’s Headstart on Monday. “It’s 10 out of 15. It’s very political in nature – either government officials or appointees in government institutions,” he added. Besides this, Villanueva observed a general lack of public trust in government, with many thinking that politicians can get away with plunder. Stopping corruption from rocking the proposed Maharlika fund should be a shared responsibility. “Yes, it requires a cultural shift, and that starts with all of us – individually and collectively demanding accountability,” he told Rappler. “There will be political will if people can recognize and harness their power and pressure politicians. This is what we are doing now in this MIF. We are actively shifting the conversation for the better.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/catapang-set-officially-replace-bantag-bureau-corrections-chief/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Acting Bureau of Corrections Director General Gregorio Pio Catapang Jr. will officially succeed his embattled predecessor Gerald Bantag, according to Department of Justice Secretary Boying Remulla. “It can be a matter of hours but tomorrow is a Cabinet meeting so I might get it tomorrow,” Remulla said on Monday, January 23, referring to the ad interim appointment papers of Catapang. Asked why the replacement took three months after Bantag was suspended, Remulla explained: “We have to study everything and we have to wait for the developments to come in for us to really be sure of what we are doing.” Catapang said the appointment will allow him to implement his reform agenda at full speed, such as the regionalization and decongestion of the New Bilibid Prison. Catapang, who once led the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the Aquino administration, was first tasked to lead the prisons bureau in October, after Bantag was suspended amid questions surrounding the killing of broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa. Bantag was later implicated in the case, and is now facing murder complaints in relation to the death of Mabasa and alleged middleman Jun Villamor. Bantag has denied liability, and accused Remulla of being the “mastermind” behind Mabasa’s death. Remulla has brushed aside Bantag’s retaliation. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/voices/editorials/how-can-you-sleep-soundly-night-president-marcos-jr/,[],"“It keeps me up at night.” Hindi raw pinapatulog ng isyu ng South China Sea si Pangulong Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Mabuti naman Mr. President. Talaga namang kailangan nang nabulabog na tulog ang problemang ito. Mabuti naman at hindi ito tulad ng laid-back na aktitud mo sa isyu ng sibuyas at ang kalihiman ng Department of Agriculture na iyung inako. But we digress. Ika nga ng musical na Hamilton, “We are outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered, outplanned” sa South China Sea o ang tinatawag nating West Philippine Sea. Wala na tayong magagawa sa “outgunned, outmanned, and outnumbered.” Pero sana hindi tayo “outplanned.” Sabi ni Marcos, ito ang “new golden age” at umaasa siyang magkakaroon ng “maturity” sa relasyong Pilipinas at Tsina. I-ignore muna natin ang subtle reference sa rehimen ng kanyang ama kaya “new golden age” ang tawag niya. Dito pumapasok ang planning sa aspeto ng “maturity” sa foreign relations. Malinaw naman na improvement si Marcos sa sinundan niyang si Rodrigo Duterte na walang alam kundi kowtow politics sa harap ng Beijing. It’s not a complement, ha, nowhere to go but up, ika nga. Wala nang lalala pa kay Digong sa pagkabopols sa foreign policy. Pero hindi rin naman sinusundan ni Marcos ang yapak ni dating pangulong Benigno Aquino III na maituturing mang confrontational, ay siyang nagsampa ng kaso sa Hague Tribunal na nauwi sa panalo. Batid naman siguro ni Marcos na maraming doublespeak na mamumutawi sa bibig ng Tsina, tulad ng “compromise,” at “strength of bilateral ties hinged on stable relations at sea.” Ang ibig sabihin malamang ng Tsina sa “stable relations” ay yung kalakarang hindi pumapalag ang Pilipinas. Kung lalagumin ang karanasan ng Vietnam sa pakikitungo sa China, nagpamalas ang Hanoi ng tibay ng bituka sa stand-offs at strategic risk. Malinaw na naiintindihan ng Vietnam ang pagbabalanse ng diplomasya at lakas-militar. Magkaiba ang kultura at tradisyon ng Hanoi at Maynila, at magkaiba rin ang relasyong Pilipinas-US kumpara sa Vietnam-US. Pero may panalo rin naman ang Pilipinas na wala sa Vietnam – ang Hague ruling na nagbabasura sa 9-dash line claim ng Tsina at kinikilala ang exclusive rights ng Pilipinas sa maritime economic zone nito. Sa harap ng ganitong balance of power, pumapasok ang papel ng Estados Unidos. Sabi nito, mahalaga sa alyansang US at Pilipinas ang regional stability. Sa chess game sa West Philippine Sea, ang US ang pinaka-obvious leverage ng Pilipinas. May umiiiral na tratado sa pagitan ng dalawa – pero higit diyan, interes ng US na ipagtanggol ang Pilipinas upang pangalagaan ang maritime trade na dumaraan sa West Philippine Sea na tinatantiyang nasa one-third ng maritime shipping sa buong mundo. Major outpost din ang Pilipinas ng US sa pagbabantay nito sa Tsina, lalo na sa lumalalang agresyon nito laban sa Taiwan. Sabi ni Pangulong Marcos sa Davos tungkol sa hidwaan sa South China Sea: “Mahalagang hindi maipit sa hidwaan ng mga superpower tulad ng Washington at Beijing sa Asya.” (It’s crucial to avoid getting entrapped in major power rivalries like between Washington and Beijing in Asia.) Dagdag pa niya, “I don’t work for Beijing, I don’t work for Washington, D.C. I work for the Philippines.” Well said Mr. President, let’s keep it that way. Sana nga mas magaling ka sa foreign relations kaysa sa economics. Noong January 21, nag-release ng video ang Philippine Coast guard na nakatambay ang isang China Coast guard vessel sa Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal. Pero kung pagbabatayan ang video na ito, wala namang “bumuting relasyon” sa ground zero… este ocean zero. Binu-bully pa rin ang mga Pilipinong mangingisda sa karagatang may karapatan tayong mangisda. Alam natin na long game ang gusot sa karagatan, at hindi ito mareresolba sa mabilis na hinaharap. Pero sa kagyat, ipakita sana ni Marcos ang pruweba na masarap ang pudding na inilalako niya. Kailangang mapairal ang kooperasyon sa karagatan at hindi puwedeng magpatuloy na binubugaw na parang langaw ang mga mangingisdang Pinoy sa West Philippine Sea. Kailangan ding mamina ng Pilipinas ang energy resource ng karagatan dahil nasa bingit na tayo ng isang energy crisis. Sa pamamagitan man ng diplomasya o lakas-militar o kombinasyon nito, ma-secure lamang natin ang mga karagatan para sa mga Pilipinong mangingisda, aba’y puwede ka nang maghilik mamayang gabi, Pangulong Marcos. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russian-warship-with-hypersonic-missiles-join-china-south-africa-drills/,[],"A Russian warship armed with new-generation hypersonic cruise weapons will participate in joint exercises with the navies of China and South Africa in February, the Russian state agency, TASS, said on Monday, January 23. It was the first official mention of the participation by the frigate, “Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov,” which is armed with Zircon missiles. The missiles fly at nine times the speed of sound, with a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Russia says. They form the centerpiece of its hypersonic arsenal, along with the Avangard glide vehicle that entered combat duty in 2019. “‘Admiral Gorshkov’ … will go to the logistic support point in Syria’s Tartus, and then take part in joint naval exercises with the Chinese and South African navies,” the agency said, citing an unidentified defense source. On Thursday, the South African National Defense Force said the drills, to run from Feb. 17 to Feb. 27 near the port city of Durban and Richards Bay, aim “to strengthen the already flourishing relations between South Africa, Russia and China.” The exercise will be the second involving the three countries in South Africa, after a drill in 2019, the defence force added in its statement. The “Gorshkov” held exercises in the Norwegian Sea this month after President Vladimir Putin sent it to the Atlantic Ocean in a signal to the West that Russia would not back down over the war in Ukraine. Russia sees the weapons as a way to pierce increasingly sophisticated U.S. missile defences that Putin has warned could one day shoot down its nuclear missiles. China, Russia and the United States are in a race to develop hypersonic weapons, seen as a way to gain an edge over any adversary because of their speeds, greater than five times that of sound and because they are harder to detect. – Rappler.com"

Kylie’s mother Kris Jenner commented “I love you Aire Webster,” while Kylie’s sister Khloe Kardashian wrote: “The king! Young king!” Since giving birth to her and Travis Scott’s second child in February 2022, Kylie has notably kept the baby’s face and his name away from the public eye. According to a PEOPLE report, a source close to the family explained that the name means “Lion of God.” Kylie also took to social media to clarify that the name is pronounced as air and not airy. It was earlier reported that Kylie initially named her son as Wolf Jacques, but announced in March 2022 that it “isn’t Wolf anymore.” “We just really didn’t feel like it was him. Just wanted to share because I keep seeing Wolf everywhere,” Kylie wrote at the time, according to PEOPLE. Kylie, 25, and Travis, 31, began dating in 2017 after meeting at Coachella. The couple split in October 2019 and agreed that their friendship and their daughter would be their “main focus” and “priority.” They have yet to address if they’ve gotten back together.

Toledo was declared champion in the ritual showdown, free-interpretation. It also won the Best in Costume and Best in Musicality awards, taking a total of P2.6 million. Second-prize winner, Naga City, won P1 million while third placer Tribu Lumad Basakanon earned P750,000. Carcar City, which won Cebu City’s Sinulog sa Kabataan Ritual Showdown on January 8, won the Sinulog-based free interpretation, taking home more than P2 million. Talisay City won in the street dancing category. Fifteen contingents from Cebu province, Cebu City, and Lapu-Lapu City joined Carmen’s Sinulog Grand Stage for the ritual showdown competition open category (Sinulog-based and Free Interpretation). Seven communities of Carmen competed among themselves in the same categories. Here is the list of winners: The last day of the Carmen Sinulog 50th anniversary celebration kicked off with a Mass officiated by Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma. Thousands of people attended the festival, where the guests included Senator Bong Revilla and celebrity couple Sarah Geronimo and Matteo Guidicelli. Garcia performed her 14th Sinulog dance to the Blessed Sto. Niño together with the Sarok dancers from Consolacion town. The governor slipped and fell on her knees during the dance, but recovered to complete it. She later noted that it was her first slip in 14 dances. Garcia said that while she felt embarrassed, “I have been through tougher times.” Cebu Provincial Board members and Capitol officials also joined the governor in her annual prayer of thanksgiving and supplication. Garcia downplayed her disagreement with Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama over the Sinulog venue, which was moved for the first time to the South Road Properties, prompting a pull-out of the province’s contingent. Three highly urbanized cities, Mandaue, Talisay, and Lapu-Lapu City, agreed with the governor and also stayed away from the Sinulog grand parade and ritual showdown. The governor explained that the Sinulog sa Carmen is not competing with the city’s Sinulog Festival as it is already on its 50th year. Garcia added that she and Rama were simply exercising executive prerogatives and judgment calls. The governor thanked Rama and the city government for supporting the Sinulog sa Carmen.

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/right-to-speedy-trial/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – In its decision to temporarily release from detention Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes, former chief of staff of now-chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile, on Thursday, January 19, the Supreme Court (SC) granted her the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Reyes is among the accused in the multi-million-peso pork barrel scam involving Enrile’s pork barrel funds, with the former Senate president as co-accused. The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus (literal translation “produce the body”) is the right to determine if a person is being lawfully or unlawfully detained. The High Court added that the writ is likewise extended to those denied the right to a speedy trial. In the case of Reyes, the SC cited her long period under detention. Reyes had been in jail since 2014 for graft and plunder charges, and her trial has been ongoing for more than eight years. But what exactly is the “right to speedy trial,” and how has it been applied in a number of cases here in the Philippines? Section 14, Article III, of the Philippine Constitution says an accused has the right to “speedy, impartial, and public trial,” and Section 16 says all persons have the right to a “speedy disposition of their cases” before any judicial body. There is a distinction between the right to speedy trial versus the right to speedy disposition. The right to speedy trial applies only to criminal cases, while the right to speedy disposition applies to all cases. These rights aim to protect persons from intentionally long and drawn-out detention and imprisonment. Since her incarceration in 2014 in Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig, Reyes had appealed for her release in 2020 and 2021. Republic Act No. 8493, also known as the Speedy Trial Act of 1998, establishes the duration for a trial from start to finish. Trials whose penalties do not exceed six months or a P1,000 fine or both should only last 180 days from the first day of trial. The court can extend the trial, given a compelling reason. There are exceptions to the time limit, such as determining whether the defendant’s right to a speedy trial was violated, or if continuing the trial would result in a miscarriage of justice. The SC released the law’s implementing rules in 1998, mentioning the need for a pre-trial, time limit for cases, and exclusions to the law as well as extending trials. Both the law and implementing rules state that the act should not hinder one’s right to a speedy trial as stated in the Constitution. An example is the case of Tatad v. Sandiganbayan, where the SC ruled that former Marcos Press Secretry Francisco Tatad’s right to speedy disposition was violated, due to the unreasonable delay in the preliminary trial. Tatad, along with Antonio Cantero, faced a graft and corruption complaint in 1974, but were only officially charged in 1979, after Tatad’s resignation from the Marcos Cabinet. Affidavits, or sworn statements, and counter-affidavits were submitted to the Sandiganbayan as part of preliminary trial procedures in 1982, but it was resolved only after 3 years, or in 1985. A period of 10 days is usually given to resolve cases under preliminary investigation. The SC found that the gathering of evidence for the case did not warrant three years to resolve. Meanwhile, in Merced Ty-Dazo and Rolando Quiminales v. Sandiganbayan, the SC ruled that Ty-Dazo and Quiminales’ right to speedy disposition was not violated despite the time it had taken for the cases to be resolved. Ty-Dazo and Quiminales were charged with graft and corruption for illegal logging in 1993. They were given time to submit a counter-affidavit which was only submitted in 1995. They moved for a reinvestigation, but this was denied in 1999. The SC wrote that a “a mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved would not be sufficient,” as they themselves were the cause of the delay in court proceedings. In The Philippines v. Sandiganbayan and Roman, the High Court also ruled against former Bataan governor Leonardo Roman and other respondents. Roman was charged with graft in his involvement in the construction of the Bataan State College’s mini-theater in 2003, which was not allotted any funding in the local government unit’s budget that year. He also certified the construction as complete, even though it was only half-done. This allowed the construction company handling the project to receive full payment for half the work. The SC wrote that despite delays in the preliminary investigations and at later stages of the investigation, Roman did not raise any red flags about irregularities, even being responsible for some of the delays in proceedings. (READ: Sandiganbayan to proceed with graft case vs former Bataan governor Roman) With respect to Reyes’ case, the SC gave four reasons for granting the writ of habeas corpus. These include the long period before the case was put on trial. The SC also said that being granted provisional freedom does not resolve her graft and plunder cases. – Rappler.com"

Director James Cameron had said the movie needed to reach the $2 billion mark just to break even. The Way of Water debuted in late December, 13 years after the original Avatar introduced the lush world of Pandora and became a worldwide phenomenon. Box office sales for The Way of Water totaled $2.024 billion on Sunday, according to Disney estimates. After six weekends in theaters, it ranks as the sixth-highest grossing movie of all time. Roughly $1.4 billion of ticket sales have come from international markets outside the United States and Canada. “It’s an unqualified success,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “Any time you are in the billions you are in the pantheon of top franchises.” Disney has not disclosed the movie’s budget, but the Hollywood Reporter said it cost at least $350 million to produce plus marketing costs. Studios split ticket sales with theaters. The strong reception for the film also should help attract crowds to a Pandora area at Walt Disney World in Florida, analysts said, and spark merchandise sales for years to come. Avatar was touted as one of the jewels in Disney’s $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets in 2019, a property it could elevate alongside Marvel and Star Wars. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who is seeking a seat on the Disney board, has argued that the company paid too much for Fox. A third Avatar movie, which Cameron has already filmed, is scheduled to debut in December 2024. The fourth and fifth installments are slated for December 2026 and December 2028. The original Avatar enchanted audiences with groundbreaking visuals that told the story of Pandora’s blue, 9-foot-tall Na’vi people. The 2009 movie remains the highest-grossing film in history with $2.9 billion in global ticket sales. In The Way of Water, actors Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake Sully and Neytiri 10 years later, now parents of five children. When humans return to go after Jake, the family takes refuge with an oceanic clan. Cameron has directed three of the top six films of all time – the two Avatar movies and 1997 drama Titanic. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-wagner-pmc-yevgeny-prigozhin-comparison-rasputin/,[],"Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin responded to comparisons between himself and the monk Rasputin who treated the son of the last tsar for haemophilia, saying on Sunday his job was not to staunch bleeding but to spill the blood of Russia’s enemies. The Financial Times newspaper said at the weekend that Prigozhin had growing influence on the Kremlin and likened him to Orthodox monk Grigory Rasputin, who had considerable influence on the wife of Russia’s last tsar, Nikolai II. Prigozhin acknowledged only last September that he had founded the Wagner group, which has played a major role in the Russian military’s attempts to capture territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “I am not very familiar with the history of Rasputin, but as far as I know, an important quality of Rasputin is that he staunched the blood flow of the young prince with incantations,” Prigozhin’s press service quoted him as saying, referring to the article. “Unfortunately, I do not staunch blood flow. I bleed the enemies of our motherland. And not by incantations, but by direct contact with them.” Wagner has been deployed in a number of African countries, generally to combat insurgents. In recent months, Prigozhin has been seen in online videos trying to lure inmates from Russian prisons to join its ranks in Ukraine. The Financial Times was not the first to compare his role to that of the monk in the Russian imperial court – a Russian journalist made the comparison last year. The newspaper said that Prigozhin, like Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, another active supporter of Russia’s war, “has positioned himself as a searing critic of military, bureaucratic, and business elites who are supposedly failing Putin with their half-hearted, incompetent approach to the war”. Prigozhin said the comparisons were “absolutely clear” and he saw his role as bringing wayward Westerners back into line. “When children engage in mischief, they try to draw the attention of their father with all sorts of unexpected tricks,” he wrote. “All Americans have to do therefore is to come to dad, ask for forgiveness and continue to behave normally.” Rasputin was assassinated in 1916 by a group of Russian noblemen who feared his growing influence on the tsarist family. – Rappler.com"

Lisa Marie Presley is survived by her daughters, actress Riley Keough and 14-year-old twins Finley and Harper Lockwood. Two days before her death, she had appeared with her mother, Priscilla Presley, at the Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, where actor Austin Butler won the best actor award for portraying her father in the film Elvis. Butler paid tribute to both women in his acceptance speech. Presley began her music career in the 2000s with two albums, To Whom It May Concern and Now What, that made the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart. She was married and divorced four times, including to pop star Michael Jackson and actor Nicholas Cage. She was the only child of one of the greatest stars in American music, and was 9 years old when Elvis Presley died of heart failure at age 42 in 1977 at Graceland. The mansion is now a popular tourist attraction. Elvis Presley and other members of his family are buried at Graceland’s Meditation Garden. Lisa Marie Presley was buried there before the memorial service alongside the grave of her son, Benjamin Keough, who died in 2020 at age 27, a death ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles County coroner. In a recent essay, she had described herself as “destroyed” by her son’s death. After the memorial service, friends, family and members of the public formed a procession past Lisa Marie Presley’s grave. “Lisa was the last very, very close piece of Elvis that was left to us and it’s so sad that she is not here with us on this Earth any more,” said Kimberly Starbuck, a 59-year-old retired baker from Memphis. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/california-monterey-park-shooting-updates-january-23-2023/,[],"A gunman killed 10 people at a ballroom dance hall during a Chinese Lunar New Year celebration late on Saturday, January 21, near Los Angeles before fleeing the scene and later killing himself when approached by police on Sunday, authorities said. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said during a Sunday afternoon press conference the motive for the shooting was not known. He identified the suspect as Huu Can Tran, 72, who wielded a pistol with a high-capacity magazine. “We want to know, we want to know how something this awful can happen,” Luna told reporters. Luna said Tran turned a handgun on himself on Sunday morning as police approached a white van he was driving in Torrance, about 20 miles (34 km) from the site of the shooting at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park. Five of the victims were male and five were female, Luna said. Their identities have not been made public. Another ten people were shot, and seven of them remain hospitalized, with at least one person in critical condition, authorities said. The sheriff’s department released images of the suspect apparently taken from surveillance camera footage showing him wearing spectacles, dressed in a dark jacket and a dark beanie hat with white stripe. Luna confirmed that Tran was involved in another incident at a dance venue in the neighboring city of Alhambra about 20 minutes after the Saturday night shooting in Monterey Park. At the second venue, witnesses said Tran walked in holding a gun that patrons were able to grab. No one was shot and Tran fled, Luna said. When police arrived at the Monterey Park ballroom, people were “pouring out of the location screaming,” department captain Andrew Meyer told reporters at a news briefing. The shooting took place after 10 pm PST (0600 GMT on Sunday; 2:00 pm on Sunday in Philippine time) around the location of a two-day Chinese Lunar New Year celebration where many downtown streets are closed for festivities that draw thousands of people from across Southern California. Police said the celebrations planned for Sunday were canceled. Residents stood gazing at the many blocks sealed off with police tape on Sunday in Monterey Park. Chester Chong, chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, described the city of about 60,000 people as a quiet, peaceful, beautiful place where everybody knows each other and helps each other. About 7 miles (11 kilometers) from downtown Los Angeles, the city has for decades been a destination for immigrants from China. Around 65% of its residents are Asian, according to U.S. Census data, and the city is known for its many Chinese restaurants and groceries. “People were calling me last night, they were scared this was a hate crime,” Chong said at the scene. The Star Ballroom Dance Studio opened in 1990, and its website features many photographs of past Lunar New Year celebrations showing patrons smiling and dancing in party clothes in its large, brightly lit ballroom. Most of its patrons are middle-aged or elderly, though children also attend youth dance classes, according to a teacher at the studio who asked to not be named. “Those are normal working people,” the teacher said. “Some are retired and just looking for an exercise or social interaction.” A flyer posted on the website advertised Saturday night’s new year party, running from 7:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Sunday. The gunshots were mistaken by some for new year fireworks, according to Tiffany Chiu, 30, who was celebrating at her parents’ home near the ballroom. “A lot of older people live here, it’s usually really quiet,” she said. “This is not something you expect here.” Video taken by local news media showed injured people, many of them appearing to be middle aged, being loaded into ambulances on stretchers. President Joe Biden condemned the killings in a written statement and said he had directed his Homeland Security adviser to mobilize federal support to local authorities. Mass shootings are recurrent in the United States, and the attack in Monterey Park was the deadliest since May 2022, when a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas. The deadliest shooting in California history was in 1984 when a gunman killed 21 people at a McDonald’s restaurant in San Ysidro, near San Diego. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/aldin-ayo-ethan-rusbatch-converge-import/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Ethan Rusbatch proved to be a surprise choice when Converge named him as its import for the PBA Governors’ Cup. While the rest of the field all brought in Americans as reinforcements for the season-ending conference, the FiberXers went a different route by tapping the services of the New Zealand forward. But Converge head coach Aldin Ayo said Rusbatch is just what the team needs, as shown by his effectiveness in a conference-opening 122-92 annihilation of NorthPort on Sunday, January 22. Although his numbers of 17 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists were not eye-popping in terms of import standards, Rusbatch served as the FiberXers’ glue guy, with six local players scoring in double figures in the blowout win. “He fits what we look for in an import – someone who will complement the locals,” said Ayo in a mix of Filipino and English. “We do not want an import who will score 50, 60 points for us because we’re going to be predictable. We want the ball to move. We have good local players and we want our locals to perform.” Ayo bared that Converge initially wanted to sign Tom Vodanovich – another New Zealander – but he still has commitments with the New Zealand Breakers, who are bound for the playoffs in the National Basketball League in Australia. Rusbatch and Vodanovich both play for Tall Blacks, the national basketball team of New Zealand. Ayo said the FiberXers opted for New Zealanders not just because they are good players but also because they have a reputation of providing a pleasing locker-room presence. “We want imports who are willing to play within the system and execute. These New Zealanders, they are known for that, and these players are fundamentally sound, and well, high in character.” Just to make sure, Ayo admitted consulting former Gilas Pilipinas coach Nenad Vucinic, who called the shots for the Tall Blacks for eight years, about Rusbatch and heard only good things. “It is very contagious during the practices, how [Ethan] works, how he pushes his teammates. He has a very positive aura in our team,” Ayo said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-results-tsitsipas-sinner-korda-hurkacz-january-22-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Stefanos Tsitsipas found another gear when it counted to fend off Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller and reach the Australian Open quarterfinals in a rare win for the high seeds on Sunday, January 22. A year after dumping Sinner out of the quarters, third seed Tsitsipas crushed the Italian’s hopes of a second great escape at Melbourne Park this year as he held firm to complete a 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory at a heaving Rod Laver Arena. After the Greek dominated for two sets and Sinner roared back into the match, Tsitsipas captured the decisive break in the sixth game of the decider before sealing it in style with a cross-court forehand winner. “I felt like I spent an eternity playing on this court,” Tsitsipas said after the four-hour battle. “What a great night. That was superb, a ‘ripper,’ as they say here.” “I had an unbelievable opponent on the other side of the court, playing incredible tennis in the third and fourth set,” the world No. 4 added. “(I) stayed really calm, just like Mr Rod Laver used to in his day,” added Tsitsipas, prompting a wave from the Australian great sitting in the crowd. The three-time Australian Open semifinalist will meet unseeded 21-year-old Czech Jiri Lehecka for a place in the semifinals. American Sebastian Korda also reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time on Sunday after defeating Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (10-7). Korda, who dumped 2021 and 2022 runner-up Daniil Medvedev out in the third round, got off to a shaky start at Rod Laver Arena against Hurkacz but the 29th seed bounced back to take the second and third sets. Hurkacz, seeded 10th, grabbed the fourth set before the decider went to a tiebreaker, where Korda won six consecutive points and wrapped up the victory with a backhand winner. The 22-year-old will face Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals after the Russian knocked out Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in straight sets. Korda’s triumph was an early birthday present for his father Petr, who won his only Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park in 1998. “My parents, they were up… just got off the phone with them. They’re going to try to go to bed. My dad’s birthday is tomorrow here. Early birthday present in a way,” Korda said, sharing he spoke to his family back home in the United States. Long touted as a rising star, Sinner will wonder what might have been, having had Tsitsipas on the ropes. He had shattered one ceiling in the previous round when he secured his first Grand Slam win from two sets down against Marton Fucsovics. But he remains winless in seven Grand Slam matches against opponents ranked in the top five. He trudged off court slowly, shaking his head in the player’s tunnel decorated with the names of champions. “Just a couple of easy misses and the match has changed quite fast… It was not fatigue,” the downcast redhead told reporters. “It’s tough right now, for sure… I had the momentum, I messed it up a little bit.” A misfiring cannon for the first two sets, Sinner turned the match on its head early in the third with a string of spell-binding winners. Duping the Greek with a sumptuous drop-shot, Sinner emerged with a break and took the set with an ace down the ‘T’. No stranger to a timed bathroom break, Tsitsipas headed off court to regroup but was still rattled when he returned. He was broken again in the third game of the fourth set when Sinner mowed down an ill-judged drop-shot. Pushing a backhand return into the tramlines on set point, Tsitsipas’s lead was erased. For all that, the match was suddenly within the Greek’s reach as Sinner double-faulted then blasted a forehand long to give up three break points in the fourth game. Tsitsipas threw one away with a clunky backhand return, then saw the others slip through his fingers as Sinner cancelled them with raw power and an ace. The Greek shrugged off the setback and gained another three break points as Sinner wavered again in his next service game. The Italian saved two but buckled on the third, sending a forehand long to hand the momentum back to Tsitsipas. The Greek reached for his most trusted weapon and locked down the match with a barrage of huge first serves. Asked how he came through the wobble, Tsitsipas proffered a technical adjustment, saying he loosened his wrist to produce more power and accuracy on serve. “That helped me serve it out pretty well towards the end without being too tense,” he said. “I’m happy I figured it out.” – Rappler.com"

The anti-graft court’s 2nd Division on Friday, January 20, sentenced Rosemarie Villamora, the bank’s former vice president, South Luzon area head, and Naga City branch head, to six years and one month to eight years in prison. Villamora was also ordered to pay P39.05 million, equivalent to the “excessive” interest that depositors Noel Antonio and Daughters of Mary “unjustly” earned from 2013 to 2017. She was perpetually barred from holding public office as well. In a notarized sworn statement dated October 25, 2017, and signed by Villamora herself, she admitted offering depositors an interest rate of 3% per month or 36% per annum if they invested in the bank’s Premium Savings Plan. The regular interest rate was only 0.25% per annum. In her testimony during the trial, Villamora then claimed she was only coerced into signing the sworn statement. But the Sandiganbayan said that based on Villamora’s track record, including her “vast experience in banking operations,” she could not have been pressured into “doing something against her will.” “Considering that the sworn statement is a notarized document, it is presumed valid, regular, and genuine,” added the court. Associate Justice Arthur Malabaguio penned the ruling, with the concurrence of Associate Justice Oscar Herrera Jr. and Associate Justice Edgardo Caldona. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-calls-end-violence-peru-respect-human-rights/,[],"VATICAN CITY – Pope Francis on Sunday, January 22, called for an end to violence in Peru, where nearly 50 people have been killed during anti-government demonstrations in the past few weeks. “No to violence, regardless of where it originates. No more deaths,” the Argentine pope said in Spanish at his weekly address to thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square, briefly departing from the rest of the address, which was in Italian. Protests have flared in Peru since President Pedro Castillo was ousted in December after attempting to dissolve the legislature to prevent an impeachment vote. “Violence extinguishes the hope of a just solution to problems,” Pope Francis said. Dozens were injured since tensions erupted again on Friday, as police clashed with protesters, with security forces in the capital Lima using tear gas to repel demonstrators who were throwing glass bottles and stones, as fires burned in the streets. “I encourage all sides to take the path of dialogue among brothers of the same nation, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law,” Francis said. The unrest, which until this week had been concentrated in Peru’s south, has prompted the government to extend a state of emergency to six regions, curtailing some civil rights. Pope Francis also called for peace and mutual forgiveness in Myanmar, where at least seven civilians were killed this week when armed forces launched air strikes on a village in the country’s central Sagaing region. Myanmar has been gripped by fighting since the army overthrew an elected government in February 2021. Resistance movements, some armed, have emerged across the country, which the military has countered with lethal force. – Rappler.com"

Ahanmisi set the tone in the lopsided victory, scattering 17 points in the first half to help Converge mount a sizable 66-46 halftime lead that proved too big for NorthPort to overcome. New Zealand import Ethan Rusbatch finished with 17 points and 9 rebounds as he served as the FiberXers’ glue guy, with five more locals scoring in double figures.

Campaign group Republic said it had been in contact with London’s police force about its plans to hold a peaceful demonstration in Parliament Square, which is overlooked by Westminster Abbey where British monarchs are crowned. “The coronation is a celebration of hereditary power and privilege, it has no place in a modern society,” Graham Smith, Republic’s chief executive, said. “At a cost of tens of millions of pounds, this pointless piece of theatre is a slap in the face for millions of people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.” Buckingham Palace said on Saturday that the coronation would be celebrated with processions, a concert at Windsor Castle, street parties, light shows, and community volunteering. Charles, 74, became king in September after his mother Queen Elizabeth died. The coronation will take place on May 6. Polls have shown most Britons back the monarchy but Republic claimed that support was on a “slow puncture.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesian-president-joko-widodo-approval-rating-all-time-high/,[],"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s approval rating has hit an all-time high after the government eased COVID-19 restrictions last month, a poll showed on Sunday, January 22. Figures released by pollster Lembaga Survei Indonesia (LSI) showed satisfaction with the president, widely known as Jokowi, had risen consistently over recent months to reach 76.2% at the start of 2023. “In the last three months, the president’s performance has increased in (terms of) positive public perception from 62.6% in September 2022 to 76.2%. If we look at the last three months, the increase is quite significant,” LSI executive director Djayadi Hanan said. The more than 10-point jump put Jokowi on his highest approval rating recorded by LSI during his current term which began in 2014. “I think this was mostly because of the lifting of (COVID-19) social restrictions and a decrease in fuel prices,” Hanan told Reuters. “The narrative that the economy will be very difficult, particularly in 2023, has been there since the beginning of last year.” Jokowi’s announcement in December of the end of pandemic restrictions was well received, the pollster said, as the restrictions had been seen as hurting the economy. The LSI poll, conducted between January 7-11 and covering more than 1,200 respondents, also comes months after the start of a high-profile trial against a former Indonesian police general. The case sparked public uproar about alleged corruption and impunity within the police, but the fact that the case was made so public was taken as a sign that the government was at least trying to tackle the issues. LSI cited improvements in perceptions of the economy and law enforcement as reasons for the ratings jump. Jokowi’s poll rating appears to have been unaffected by both the passing last month of a controversial new criminal code, and his issuing of an emergency regulation to replace the jobs law. Jokowi is serving his second and final term in office with the next election scheduled for February 2024. Sunday’s poll found Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo was the favored candidate to succeed Jokowi, although his candidacy is yet to be announced. The other top candidates were Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto and former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, both of whom have announced their intentions to run. – Rappler.com"

Back in action after taking a hiatus as he ran and won as San Juan City councilor, Yap stole the show and scattered 12 points in the first half, including the buzzer-beating three-pointer that tied the score at 54-54 going into the break.

Hill dominated the main event of the card, mixing up a wide variety of strikes and mostly avoiding grappling exchanges where the 43-year-old Teixeira would have had an advantage. “Where I came from, to get to this, it’s unreal,” the 31-year-old Hill said in a post-fight interview. “Anything’s possible. Hard work, dedication, accountability, don’t let nobody tell you nothing.” Teixeira, who beat Jan Blachowicz to win the title in October 2021 only to lose it in his first defense against Jiri Prochazka in May 2022, announced his retirement after the fight. The 43-year-old Teixeira was attempting to become the second-oldest champion in UFC history behind Randy Couture, who earned a crown at age 45 in 2008. Instead, he fell to 33-9 and announced his retirement after the match. “In reality, I think I’m too tough for my own good, too tough for my own health. I can’t keep up anymore,” Teixeira said. Hill landed 248 strikes to Teixeira’s 108, including a whopping 232 signature strikes to the Brazilian’s 75.

Bren Esports capped an impressive run that saw it upset newly crowned world champion Echo with a dominant 2-0 win over GameLab on Sunday, January 22, earning the right to have Duckeyyy appointed as Sibol head coach. Tasked to lead the national team Sibol to a third straight Mobile Legends gold medal in the SEA Games, Duckeyyy brings with him extensive success in the international scene. Duckeyyy helped Indonesian squad EVOS Legends rule the M1 World Championship in 2019 and steered Bren Esports to the M2 crown in 2021.

Led by former SEA Games champion Angelo “Pheww” Arcangel, Bren Esports then made quick work of GameLab in their best-of-three finale.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-congo-visit-seeks-heal-bleeding-wounds/,[],"KINSHASA, Congo – Pope Francis’ visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo will remind the world not to ignore decades-long conflicts that have beset the mineral-rich nation and wrecked the lives of millions, the Vatican’s envoy to Kinshasa said. Pope Francis is expected to visit Congo from January 31 to February 3, the first visit of a pope since 1985. Major preparations have been underway in the vast country, home to the largest Roman Catholic community in Africa. “The Congo which receives the Pope today is not the same as the one which welcomed Pope John Paul II 38 years ago,” Ettore Balestrero, the Vatican’s envoy to Kinshasa, told Reuters. “Unfortunately, there have been wars and conflicts that continue. He comes to console the people, he comes to heal wounds that are still bleeding.” He said the mineral-rich central African nation has 45 million Catholics. The country has struggled with instability and conflicts since the 1990s that have killed millions and given rise to dozens of militias, some of which remain active. The pope had planned to visit the eastern city of Goma when the trip was official announced, but that leg of the trip has been canceled follow the resurgence of fighting between the army and the M23 rebel group. “Congo is a moral emergency that cannot be ignored,” Balestrero said. The pope is expected to meet victims from the east of the country on February 1 and leaders of Catholic charities, according to the program of his visit shared by the Vatican. The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Congo. It manages around 40% of the country’s health structure. About six million students are taught in nursery, primary and secondary schools run by the church, Balestrero said. It also runs one of the biggest and most trusted election observation missions. “Historically, the Church in this country has accompanied the consolidation of democratic consciousness and has often been the spokesperson for the most urgent needs of the population,” Balestrero added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/review-netflix-tennis-documentary-series-break-point/,['BEATRICE GO'],"Released before the start of the year-opening Grand Slam, Netflix’s Break Point hopes to help set tennis up for success this year. The show follows the sport’s up and coming stars in their ultimate goal to be “next big thing” in tennis history. Set in the colorful year of 2022, sports continues to prove that it will never be without surprises and drama as it was jam-packed with major upsets and big decisions by tennis greats. In 2022, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, who were part of the list of age-defying athletes, announced their retirement from tennis. In the men’s game, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are the remaining legends in the sport, stirring up the younger generation’s goal to unseat them from their thrones. On the women’s side, there remains to be no clear favorite as the current pool of players are equally competitive and physical, showing how tennis becomes a game of mental strength in every tournament. Though Break Point did not cover the full drama and nitty-gritty details of a tennis game, the docu-series was aimed to increase tennis viewership this year and sustain fan engagement from the younger generations. From the storytelling to the editing, it all appeals to the late millennial and Gen Z audiences – personality-focused, highlight culture, dramatic slow-mos, cuts and transitions. But Season 1’s first five episodes were able to unpack a few themes that the sport and its athletes are currently facing in order to drive change. (Heads up! Spoiler alert!) Episode 1 zones into Nick Kyrgios’ life. Notorious for his impulsive statements and racket-breaking behavior on the court, Break Point spins Kyrgios’ reputation into a “maverick” by showing how difficult it was for him to deal with the pressure of winning and stewarding his great talent in the sport. Criticized, yet self-admittedly a “part-time tennis player,” Kyrgios reveals he’s been on-and-off tennis because of the need to take some time away to relieve himself of the pressure. But contrary to this, he finds an antidote in his tennis comeback in the 2022 Australian Open. After being booted out in Round 2 of the men’s singles draw, Kyrgios teams up with long-time buddy and fellow Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis in the men’s doubles but with the lone goal of just “having fun.” But after disposing top-seeded Croatian pair of Nikola Mektić and Mate Pavić, they suddenly saw a chance that they could win their first Grand Slam title together. Australian fans gave them the moniker of K2 or “Cereal Killers” and put up fan signs using the logo of Kellogg’s Cereal during their matches. The Kyrgios-Kokkinakis duo slayed their opponents with their entertaining tennis, banked on the joy of playing instead of the pressure of winning. Friendship and strong connection beyond the game were shown to be incredibly important in doubles pairs. Photos of a young Kyrgios and Kokkinakis and a scene of them playing a party game together showed the strength of their relationship. When Kyrgios started to spiral down because of a slew of mistakes, it was Kokkinakis who stepped up to fight back. Then it was a happy ending after all when the Australian pair lifted their first Grand Slam title in the men’s doubles event. The docu-series showed how tennis players have to live with the tension of confidence and self-doubt, balancing pressure and expectations and remaining methodical and disciplined with their routines. World No. 6 Maria Sakkari, who is described to have an archetype of a “Greek warrior,” carries the burden of winning her first major title. She talks about the different voices in her head and demonstrates incredible self-awareness as she processes her performances and skills after every game. World No. 35 Alja Tomljanovic also expressed the same struggles especially when she made a first-round exit against Spaniard Paula Badosa in the 2022 Australian Open. In the competitive women’s game, the margin of victory is so narrow because no matter how physically skilled and prepared a player is, the wins boil down to the mental tenacity of the players. Badosa, world No. 2, was one of the first tennis players to be open about her battle with depression and anxiety after she struggled adjusting to the women’s game. There was a surge of expectations after she won the 2015 French Open girls singles title. She advocates for athletes to be more open about their vulnerabilities because it’s not a sign of weakness. “A lot of people don’t talk about it because they feel they’re going to be weaker, but I think it’s totally the opposite. I’m fighting a lot mentally to try and find myself again,” Badosa says. On the men’s side, Kyrgios dives into detail about how he struggled to deal with the pressure and expectations on his unorthodox talent after he upset Rafael Nadal in the 2014 Wimbledon Championships at 17 years old. His manager Daniel Horsfall shared that Kyrgios needed to have his location turned on for him to find the tennis prodigy when he had periods of drinking every night. But American Taylor Fritz showed how self-belief and confidence can prevail even in the toughest of situations in the sport. Fritz burst into the top 10 of men’s tennis after a stellar 2022 season and Break Point captures how he battled an ankle fracture against Nadal to win his first major title – the 2022 Indian Wells Championship – in his hometown in California. Fritz remained determined to play “the match of his life,” while his whole team and medics recommended him to pull out of the final. The American was known to have the “strongest willpower” as described by his coach Paul Annacone, who mentored tennis greats Roger Federer and Pete Sampras. And that willpower propelled him to an unforgettable Masters 1000 straight-set over 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal. Tennis players may also be the most disciplined type of athletes as any disruption to their routines becomes an issue. Norway’s Casper Ruud and his team were angry at tournament officials for closing his practice court even without rain in the 2022 Roland Garros tournament. Italy’s Matteo Berretini also had a heated conversation with former girlfriend Tomljanovic about requesting to move to another room when she had to wake up early for a TV segment. Nadal was also constantly seen warming up with the same routine before his big games. Tennis players are constantly traveling all over the world, which costs them time with their family and friends. But the right relationships matter when they are playing at a very high level. Netflix features the parents and the players’ romantic relationships on how they have to compromise and support the needs of high-level athletes. Taylor Fritz mentioned that he was “playing his best” while he was in a relationship with influencer Morgan Riddle. In the French Open, Felix Auger-Aliassime’s family came to surprise him for his 22nd birthday as the Canadian started traveling on his own at the age of nine years old for tennis. Break Point also covered the inspiring relationship between world No. 2 Ons Jabeur from Tunisia and her husband Karim Kamoun, who joined her team as a fitness trainer because of lack of funding. The couple had to establish professional and personal boundaries and rules in order for them to work together. Jabeur took the tennis world by a storm in 2022 as she became the first Arab and African woman to win a WTA 1000 title in the Madrid Open, and make it to two Grand Slam finals. The tennis ace, 28, shared that people had expectations of her becoming a housewife if she had failed to clinch tennis success because of the culture in Tunisia. But she was determined to realize her dream. In a sweet scene of Kamoun taking the camera to film Jabeur, the couple shared that they mutually agreed to push back their dream of having a family for success in tennis. Jabeur lamented that it isn’t as easy for women to get back to their top-level performance after pregnancy. The couple also breaks the culture of patriarchal societies as Kamoun openly takes Jabeur’s Grand Slam dream as his own. While other top-level players search for decorated coaches of legends to fortify their teams, Jabeur has for so long decided to stick with her all-Tunisian team composed of her husband and Issam Jellali. But the women’s players have also put up a challenge for tennis to continue battling for equal prize money in their respective tours. Excluding the four Grand Slams, The Financial Times reported that the prize money in the men’s tour ATP is 75% higher than that of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) events. With Break Point’s first season in the bag, will this drive the change needed in the future of tennis? – Rappler.com"

Another 10 people were taken to local hospitals to be treated for injuries, and at least one was in critical condition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said early on Sunday morning, about five hours after the attack in Monterey Park. When local police first arrived, people were “pouring out of the location screaming,” department captain Andrew Meyer told reporters in a news briefing at the scene. There was no immediate information about a motive for the shooting or a description of the suspect or kind of gun used. The shooting took place after 10 pm PST (0600 GMT on Sunday) around the location of a Chinese Lunar New Year celebration where many downtown streets are closed for festivities that draw thousands of people from across Southern California. Police said the festivities planned for Sunday were now cancelled. Monterey Park is a city of about 60,000 people around 7 miles (11 kilometers) from downtown Los Angeles. About two-thirds of its residents are Asian, according to US Census data, and the city is known for its many Chinese restaurants and groceries. The sheriff’s department said it did not know whether the attack was racially motivated. Footage posted on social media showed injured people on stretchers being taken to ambulances by emergency staff. Around the scene of the shooting police guarded cordoned-off streets, the video showed. Seung Won Choi, who owns a seafood barbecue restaurant near the site of the attack, told the Los Angeles Times that three people rushed into his restaurant and told him to lock the door because a man was unloading multiple rounds of ammunition at the dance club across the street. Mass shootings are recurrent in the United States, and the attack in Monterey Park was the deadliest since May 2022, when a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas. The deadliest shooting in California history was in 1984 when a gunman killed 21 people at a McDonald’s restaurant in San Ysidro, near San Diego. – Rappler.com"

Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Duma – Russia’s lower house of parliament – warned that the United States and NATO’s support of Ukraine is leading the world to a “terrible war.” “If Washington and NATO countries supply weapons that will be used to strike civilian cities and attempt to seize our territories, as they threaten, this will lead to retaliatory measures using more powerful weapons,” Volodin said on the Telegram messaging app. “Arguments that the nuclear powers have not previously used weapons of mass destruction in local conflicts are untenable. Because these states did not face a situation where there was a threat to the security of their citizens and the territorial integrity of the country.” Western allies pledged billions of dollars in weapons for Ukraine last week, although they failed to persuade Germany to lift a veto on providing German-made Leopard battle tanks, which are held by an array of NATO nations but whose transfer to Ukraine requires Berlin’s approval. Since its invasion on February 24, which it has cast as defending itself from an aggressive West, Russia has taken control of parts of Ukraine and has said it will never return them. Kyiv has said that restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity is not open for negotiation. Volodin’s comments followed a similar threat last week by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former prime minister and president. Volodin, 58, has been speaker of the lower house, the State Duma, since 2016, having previously held a senior role in the presidential administration. As a member of Putin’s Security Council, he has regular access to the president. “Deliveries of offensive weapons to the Kyiv regime will lead to a global catastrophe,” he said. – Rappler.com"

Starting in place of Deandre Ayton, Biyombo anchored a strong defensive effort with a season-high 16 rebounds and combined with Okogie for 7 blocked shots as the Suns limited the visitors to 37.5% shooting en route to a second straight win to open a five-game home stand. Bennedict Mathurin had 23 points off the bench and TJ McConnell recorded the triple-double of his career –18 points and season-highs in assists with 12 and rebounds with 10 – to pace Indiana, which dropped its seventh in a row and second in two nights. In a tight affair in which neither team led by more than 10, the Suns, who also were without Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Cam Johnson, appeared to take control when Okogie buried a three-pointer for a 102-94 lead with 3:47 to play. But the Pacers chipped away, getting within 104-101 with 1:56 remaining on a three-point play by Mathurin, then as close as 109-107 when Buddy Hield buried a triple with seven seconds left.

Of the 10 listed items under “real properties,” 4 are lots all located in Matuod, Lian, Batangas. The 10 listed real property assets are identical to her listing in 2011. Based on her 2012 SALN, two residential houses are also in Matuod. Besides the P1.5-million house constructed in 2010, she had a second one built in the same year. It was more expensive at P6 million. It was in her 2011 SALN that Reyes first declared her property in Sta Ana, Cagayan, that she acquired way back 1999. The lot which was bought for P285,000 was also listed in her 2012 SALN, but not in earlier SALN submissions, including the one filed for 2004. Reyes, along with Enrile who hails from Cagayan, has been charged with plunder by the justice department before the Office of the Ombudsman in connection with misused pork barrel funds. A Commission of Audit report covering the years 2007-2009 found that money from the Priority Development Assistance Program of lawmakers was funnelled by them and individuals to fake non-governmental organizations controlled by Janet Lim Napoles – in exchange for hefty commissions. A closer scrutiny of her 2007 SALN – which mirrors her financial standing before the additional lot purchase in 2008 – shows that she had total liabilities of P20.2 million, 17 million of which was in bank and personal loans. Her net worth stood at about P17 million. In 2008, her net worth increased to over P20 million, while her personal and bank loans increased to P18 million. In 2009, her net worth rose steadily to P22.9 million, while her loans remained unchanged. In 2010, her net worth rose further to P27.2 million, as she wiped out her P8 million bank loan in 2009, but doubled her personal loans from P10 million in 2009 to P20 million in 2010. Her mortgage payable of P5 million in 2009 was also cleared in 2010. By 2011, Reyes’ personal loans increased further to P34 million, with no bank loans or mortgage payables. Her P29.36 million net worth in 2011 dropped to P27.81 million in 2012. By this time, her personal loans had risen further to P36 million. In 2012, the only vehicles she listed under her personal properties were a Toyota Fortuner acquired in 2007 for P1.3 million under the Cruz & Reyes Law Offices (her law office), a pre-owned Toyota Grandia acquired in 2008 for P700,000, and a pre-owned Toyota Altis bought in 2009 for P600,000. Senate sources, who had seen the vehicle in the Senate parking lot in the past, said she also used a Toyota Sequioa SUV, similar to what Enrile himself also used. This was not listed in her SALNs, however. Besides the vehicles and her P3-million time deposit, the next big item in her personal properties list for 2012 was jewelry worth P3 million. Among her weaknesses, said those who know her, are jewelry and designer bags. When she was still working in the Senate, Reyes reportedly signed documents that facilitated the release of Enrile’s PDAF to fake NGOs linked to Napoles. She is also mentioned in the affidavit of Merlina Suñas, among the witnesses in the PDAF scam, as being among the recipients of commissions given by Napoles to legislators and their staff. “Ang porsiyento naman ni Atty Gigi Reyes ay pinapadala ni Madame Jenny kay Fernando Ramirez o kay John Raymund de Asis sa bahay ni Atty Reyes mismo,” Suñas said. (The commission of Atty Gigi Reyes is given by Madame Jenny [Napoles] to Fernando Ramirez or John Raymund de Asis to be delivered to the house of Atty Reyes herself.) Generally well liked in the Senate because of her and her principal’s generosity to Senate employees, Reyes was also acknowledged to be influential. Long-time employees at the Senate said that when Enrile was Senate president and she was chief of staff, permanent positions needed her approval. “Kung hindi ka malakas, hindi mo makukuha ang position,” one former employee said. (If you were not favored by her, you wouldn’t get the position.) After flying to Macau on August 31, Reyes has not been publicly visible since. She could not be reached for comment. The last she was heard from was when she reacted to Enrile’s lawyer Enrique dela Cruz who said the former Senate president “never authorized anyone to enter into an illegal transaction. If they did, it’s outside their authority and they should be held responsible.” Reacting to this, Reyes wrote about “travesty and betrayal” in a September 21 post on her Facebook page. She said in that post, “the worst blow has just been dealt upon me by no less than the camp of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, the man I served with full dedication, honesty and loyalty for 25 years.” Enrile, known to have a special fondness for his former chief of staff, publicly declared that he was not out to betray his people, in apparent reference to Gigi Reyes. – Rappler.com If you have tips or stories the Rappler Investigative Desk can pursue email investigative@rappler.com."
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-covid-19-updates-january-22-2023/,[],"BEIJING – China rang in the Lunar New Year on Sunday, January 22, with its people praying for health after three years of stress and financial hardship under the pandemic, as officials reported almost 13,000 new deaths caused by the virus between January 13 and 19. Queues stretched for about one kilometre (a half-mile) outside the iconic Lama temple in Beijing, which had been repeatedly shut before COVID-19 restrictions ended in early December, with thousands of people waiting for their turn to pray for their loved ones. One Beijing resident said she wished the year of the rabbit will bring “health to everyone.” “I think this wave of the pandemic is gone,” said the 57-year-old, who only gave her last name, Fang. “I didn’t get the virus, but my husband and everyone in my family did. I still think it’s important to protect ourselves.” Earlier, officials reported almost 13,000 deaths related to COVID in hospitals between January 13 and 19, adding to the nearly 60,000 in the month or so before that. Chinese health experts say the wave of infections across the country has already peaked. The death toll update, from China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, comes amid doubts over Beijing’s data transparency and remains extremely low by global standards. Hospitals and funeral homes have been overwhelmed since China abandoned the world’s strictest regime of COVID controls and mass testing on December 7 in an abrupt policy U-turn, which followed historic protests against the curbs. The death count reported by Chinese authorities excludes those who died at home, and some doctors have said they are discouraged from putting COVID-19 on death certificates. China on January 14 reported nearly 60,000 COVID-related deaths in hospitals between Dec. 8 and Jan. 12, a huge increase from the 5,000-plus deaths reported previously over the entire pandemic period. Spending by funeral homes on items from body bags to cremation ovens has risen in many provinces, documents show, one of several indications of COVID’s deadly impact in China. Some health experts expect that more than one million people will die from the disease in China this year, with British-based health data firm Airfinity forecasting COVID-19 fatalities could hit 36,000 a day this week. As millions of migrant workers return home for Lunar New Year celebrations, health experts are particularly concerned about people living in China’s vast countryside, where medical facilities are poor compared with those in the affluent coastal areas. About 110 million railway passenger trips are estimated to have been made during January 7-21, the first 15 days of the 40-day Lunar New Year travel rush, up 28% year-on-year, People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, reported. A total of 26.23 million trips were made on the Lunar New Year eve via railway, highway, ships and airplanes, half the pre-pandemic levels, but up 50.8% from last year, state-run CCTV reported. The mass movement of people during the holiday period may spread the pandemic, boosting infections in some areas, but a second COVID-19 wave is unlikely in the near term, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Saturday on the Weibo social media platform. The possibility of a big COVID rebound in China over the next two or three months is remote as 80% of people have been infected, Wu said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-should-philippines-develop-nuclear-energy/,[],"Nuclear energy has emerged as one of the most controversial issues on energy security and national development in the Philippines. The most recent Presidents, Rodrigo Duterte and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., have openly supported for nuclear to have a much larger presence in the country’s energy mix. With these pronouncements come renewed debates on whether to revive the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP), whose construction began under the rule of the current President’s father. The power plant was never operationalized due to strong opposition over issues of corruption, high costs, safety, and sustainability, with attempts for its recommissioning successfully blocked in the past few decades. However, with stronger political support, advocates for nuclear have been bolder on their claims for this energy source, citing its fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) that makes it a potential mitigation option against the climate crisis. They also emphasize its capacity to match the nation’s baseload energy requirements. At the moment, the nation is still in the stage of considering options for sites, technologies, and proposals for installing facilities. However, the Philippines has a chance to change its course and avoid making the same mistake again. Nuclear energy should not become a major part of the future Philippine energy system. Here are reasons why. The Philippines is exposed to different types of hazards, including climate-related threats such as typhoons and extreme rainfall. Without drastic reductions in GHG emissions, these threats can potentially become even more destructive in the coming years, around the time nuclear plants would start being operational. This is not to mention other natural hazards to which the country is exposed, especially earthquakes as it is situated right along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It must be remembered that the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan occurred largely because of an earthquake and tsunami. Lessons must also be learned from the case of the BNPP, which was ridiculously overpriced yet was filled with so many technical and financial issues that made it unideal to be operationalized. With its high vulnerability to worsening climate change impacts and other natural risks, making the Philippines dependent on nuclear power puts many communities at high risk to the impacts of a potential disaster. Supporters of nuclear energy have still not presented a clear-cut solution to the problem of safely disposing radioactive waste; not even developed nations have truly figured this out. Despite the frequent suggestion for disposing of used nuclear fuel deep underground, there is currently no such licensed geological repository. This means that the radioactive waste currently awaiting disposal presents a high risk of leaking radiation and other harmful impacts that can pose serious risks to human health and the environment. Do not take the seemingly-high public support for nuclear at face value, either. Surveys may have shown that a majority of Filipinos are in favor of nuclear energy in the country, but they also reveal that many would not want a nuclear power plant or waste storage facility near their respective communities. Even former Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi recognized this, saying that “the only problem is, ang sinasabi ay not in my own backyard”. This proves that public support for nuclear power in the Philippines is more polarizing than what it seems. Incidents like the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters already show undeniable proof that nuclear poses higher levels of safety and security risks than other energy sources considered as alternatives to fossil fuels. This is why the Philippine government must exercise the precautionary principle, a vital part of the country’s environmental management framework, and protect the rights of its citizens to a healthy environment, as recognized under global and national policies. As mentioned, the BNPP is extremely expensive. It was built based on a $500-million proposal of Westinghouse Electric, but with its construction being littered with technical issues (i.e. location at high risk to earthquakes) and financial controversies, the project ended up costing $2.3 billion. This has resulted in a tremendous debt that had to be repaid by generations of Filipinos, whether they support nuclear power, its proponent politicians, or otherwise. Yet this is not a unique case, as a nuclear plant is known to be the most expensive plant type to build. Long project cycles and high capital costs make it a risky investment, which has been amplified during times of crises much like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. There has also been many instances of construction delays, funding issues, project cancellations, and safety concerns associated with nuclear in many developed countries. These occurred despite strong government support, including through subsidies financed through shifting construction costs and the burden of risks to taxpayers. Something similar is currently seen in the Philippines, where the current energy policy framework allows operators to pass on losses and costs incurred to consumers. Should nuclear plants be built, there is a likely possibility that the already-expensive electricity costs would even be higher. It should be noted that the costs of electricity from renewable energy (RE) are projected to decrease in the coming years, while the cost from nuclear would increase instead. By 2030, RE-produced electricity will have a lower average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific than that produced from either nuclear or coal. For instance, the LCOE for solar photovoltaic will decrease from 2021 to 2030 for utility, commercial, and residential purposes. The LCOE for onshore wind will also be cheaper during this period. These types of RE are either cost-competitive or already cheaper than nuclear, which is likely to become more expensive by 2030, and much cheaper than coal or gas, the latter of which is another energy source being pushed for by the current administration. Instead of yet another round of “band-aid” solutions, Philippine policymakers must instead commit to further develop RE instead of nuclear, coal, or any other fuel source. – Rappler.com John Leo Algo is the Deputy Executive Director for Programs and Campaigns of Living Laudato Si’ Philippines.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/kayla-galang-filipino-american-short-film-sundance-boulevard/,['RYAN OQUIZA'],"SAN DIEGO, USA – Kayla Galang received the news that her short film, When You Left Me on That Boulevard, was accepted into Sundance around the same time she was hosting friends and family screenings in San Diego, so naturally, it was hard to keep it a secret. “The past two months have been a complete whirlwind,” Galang shared in a virtual interview. “I was just in complete disbelief and immediately just cried and called all my producers. Everyone came over, and I was the biggest zombie the day that I found out because I was very sleep-deprived.” Boulevard is a deeply personal film for the Fil-Am director. Born in Olongapo City, Philippines, she was raised in San Diego, California, before moving to Austin, Texas, where she studied and now works as a producer and editor at the University of Texas in the College of Liberal Arts. Her previous two films, Joan on the Phone (2016) and Learning Tagalog With Kayla (2021), both made appearances at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin, the latter of which won the Audience Award. “Most of my films have been made in Austin. Boulevard is actually my first film outside of Texas ever. So it was a big homecoming of a film.” That homecoming involved shooting in her auntie’s house at Paradise Hills, gathering cast members around the area, and exploring the warmth and liveliness of a typical Filipino-American family without ever resorting to mockery or parody. The film, set in 2006, is about a teenager named Ly (Kailyn Dulay) who gets high with her cousins before a boisterous family Thanksgiving, and it’s every bit funny, charming, and sentimental for it. It has all the hallmark Filipino party traditions, such as karaoke singing, classic tabletop delicacies, and aunts gossiping like there’s no tomorrow. I spoke with Kayla to discuss her unexpected journey to Sundance and how the community aspect of the film was reflected not only on-screen but in the behind-the-scenes dynamics as well. You found out you got in Sundance while you were doing the community screenings in San Diego, so were there Magic Sing Karaokes after that? How was the celebratory feast? (Laughter) The celebration happened in Texas roughly a week after we flew out from San Diego. I had gotten the call after I had fallen asleep for 30 minutes on a Sunday night. Typically, I don’t fall asleep that early so on any other given day, I would’ve gotten that call. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the missed call and email from Sundance, and I just completely flipped out because I was so sleep-deprived and couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. Everyone just basically came over, and we all just hung out the entire day and, later that night, ordered a bunch of chicken fingers from Raising Cane’s. We watched a movie called ‘Saved!’ (2004), one of my favorite mid-2000s movies, so it was just a homey, warm celebration, and then the big celebration came with the friends and family screening. It was nice to see the community approval and reception first before going off to Sundance. Based on watching this film and your previous ones, you seem interested in the mid-2000s. How has that transition between San Diego and Austin influenced your creative craft? It’s interesting because just going from cool, breezy, and hilly San Diego and going to oppressively hot, humid, and kinda swampy Houston was one of the biggest cases of whiplash I’ve ever experienced. Just on a climate level, I think getting to live in these two vastly different places and seeing my family and community move to both places made me really interested in exploring various specific places and times. When I think about Houston, the humidity and the cicadas just create a palpable experience in my brain. And so, just getting to explore climate and landscape and how that informs the way that people in my community move to these different places, I think that’s become a huge interest of mine in filmmaking. Given that homecoming aspect, what was it like going back to San Diego and shooting ‘Boulevard?’ I think it was around 2019 I visited my mom’s province, and she, her cousins, and childhood friends threw a big party for themselves by the water, like they rented this big karaoke cabana, and it was a very familiar scene of them cooking a lot of food and bringing them all over and chatting and laughing and dancing and singing. I actually watched one of my aunties sing Boulevard (by Dan Byrd) at that karaoke party, so that was a very spellbinding moment. So I guess sitting there and seeing this very familiar scene as someone in their late-20s, it occurred to me that the last time I had seen them all together was back in 2006, which I think was at my auntie’s house for Thanksgiving. It was very emotionally striking for me; it really made me meditate on the distance I had from the experience of being with them in San Diego. It was also around this time that I started to go to therapy as well. A lot of that work looked like extending loving kindness to my younger self. I feel like when I was living in San Diego and just being a teenager concerned with affairs of the heart, I developed a lot of uncharitable views and habits about myself, and so I think just the alchemy of seeing my aunties for the first time and starting to interrogate my younger self and her place in my adult life, that’s what made me interested in going back to San Diego. On the whole idea of extending loving kindness to your younger self, is this film autobiographical or semi-autobiographical in any way? I feel like it has the vague shape of my family and me, but none of it is really autobiographical. I think it’s only spiritually autobiographical on some level. It’s funny because my mom saw a cut, and she was very horrified; she was like: “Did you actually smoke weed on Thanksgiving?” It does pull from my emotional memories of every Thanksgiving party I’ve been to up until now, even in Houston, where I celebrate Thanksgiving with my family. It’s a vastly different Filipino-American community in Houston than it is in San Diego. Though, I feel like there are still the same elements and scenes, and so I’ve always just gravitated to those aspects of the parties. Can you elaborate more on what were the challenges, learning experiences, and general realizations you had during the shoot? The funny thing is, I feel like this was one of the smoother shoots I’ve been on, which is very surprising to me. I think that was validated by seeing a lot of people having fun and generally in a flow on set; I thought that was really special. One of the biggest challenges really was a pretty common one in that we were all just trying to make the day and trying to stay on schedule, I think that’s always something on a film set. A lot of us came from other sets beforehand, we’ve had some pretty awful experiences, and we really wanted to avoid that, and we took careful steps to avoid that. I think that the payoff was awesome, and I wanna take my time for the next one. In terms of the collaboration aspect, your actors and the people you worked with were new. Do you think the community aspect played a role in making the shoot smooth? Yeah, because I think there was so much community investment and excitement. Three of our principal cast members were actually from the area and actually grew up there. The other two were based in Southern California, so they were very familiar with the aspects of the community, so they immediately got it. They were very excited, and it was also scary for me because I was like: “Oh, there’s pressure to really make this experience worthwhile for them.” I think it was that community involvement that immediately gave them a boost and an understanding of what this story was and what it meant to me personally because Paradise Hills is such a special place, and I miss it all the time. Your short film is peppered with many Filipino customs and even little bits like gossipy aunts, overcrowded celebrations, and the segmented lines between generations in Thanksgiving. What makes you drawn to point a camera at these things? It’s something I hadn’t really seen. Oftentimes, when Filipino culture, elements, or customs are highlighted, they can often be satirical or farcical in a way that doesn’t really sit well with me. I just really wanted to turn my camera on people of a specific place, and yes, a lot of these things we have in common across our families. Again, whether it’s in Houston or San Diego, the scene is always familiar. I just wanted to commit that to film because I didn’t want to just live in my brain that warmth, appreciation, and gratitude I have for that kind of space. Your film is branded as a comedy and looking at your future work, you’re currently developing two feature films: ‘’06-’07,’ a coming-of-age comedy set in mid-2000s southeast San Diego, and ‘On Earth as it is in Heaven,’ a comedy about familial grief set in present-day Houston. What makes you interested in this kind of comedy wherein you’re honoring emotional memories and you’re trying to be kinder to your younger self? It’s funny because I never endeavored to be a comedy kind of filmmaker. I didn’t really start calling what I made a comedy until very recently when people started laughing at the things I was doing—for better or worse. So, I didn’t necessarily know that I had a gravitation towards comedy so much as it is just in my DNA to be a little bit goofy and to laugh at things. I think that, in any case, life in itself is really funny and doesn’t make any sense, and the universe doesn’t really act, at least to me, with any sort of judgment, righteousness, or justice. So, I’m really interested in gravitating toward the really dumb things that happen in serious and quiet moments and clashes. For instance, with the scene of Ly sitting in the bedroom and the karaoke song coming on, that’s something that happened to me before, just suddenly getting disrupted by really loud music and my auntie’s having a really good time in the room while I sulk and harbor a crush. I just really wanna turn the camera on things that make me laugh, whether that’s funny or not to other people; I dig it, and I wanna share it. What are some of your influences in terms of the 2000s-inspired styling, the production design, and generally the mood of the film? I’m still trying to figure out exactly what my influences are. It’s an amalgamation of everything I’ve ever watched and experienced. A big recent influence is the animated film Only Yesterday (1991) because I just love the way that it tackles little slice-of-life vignettes with such humor and heart; it’s just a very beautiful film. I also really loved Yi Yi (2000); I loved how the camera is just so static and observing. I found that, for better or worse, I like to stay on sticks because not only is it cheaper to do so, but I just really like watching things flourish within a frame, and I love seeing people navigate a frame or move within a frame. I have also recently been into this show that recently got canceled called Joe Pera Talks With You (2018) because there’s a slowness and quietness to it, and it’s following this guy who’s basically a grandpa in the real world, but the world is never mean or unkind to him, it just accepts him as who he is. Did you get help from your aunties and relatives and ask them what was the best way to show how a Filipino family is? Did you have that sort of consultation with them? I mostly got help from the actors, actually. Elle Rodriguez plays Auntie Pinky, and Melissa Arcaya plays Pacencia, who’s Ly’s mom. I’d say I got a lot of insight from them because they were living and breathing these characters, and they had their own experiences to bring. I was a little bit nervous to bring the concept to my family because of the subject matter. It’s funny because I shot at my auntie’s house, and whenever I talk about the scenes there, I was like: “Oh yeah, and she smokes weed with them because her cousins are really bad influences.” So I was a little bit afraid to bring it to my family for any gut-checking. But I’d say that Elle and Melissa were such saving graces in that they really brought their experiences, and they genuinely felt like my real aunties, especially Elle. The bridge between her and her character was not very far, and she just reminded me of all my aunties just jam-packed into one. So, I guess, in a way, they turned into my family. What was the best experience on set? I was very much dreading working with children, but we had to have kids on that set because it wouldn’t be a party without them. And so, I was really just tense going into the idea of directing children because, again, I’m not a really good mentor. I’m not really maternal or nurturing, so I was really scared at the prospect of that. But we got to set, and it was really fun to hang out with the kids and so much fun to direct them because we gave them so many really silly objectives with big incentives. At some point, to motivate them to run around the house, I was just like: “Who wants to play ‘Catch the Orange?’” I took an orange from the orange table, and then the amount of screams like: “I wanna do it, I wanna catch the orange!” Y’all were just in it, y’all were ready (laughter). So it was really fun to work with the kids. We got to play ‘Red Light, Green Light’ with them. We got to play Tekken with them. There was one shot where I had them playing hide and seek, we had two kids hide in a closet and another hide behind the door. In one of those shots, we just see a real hide-and-seek game happening, which was really thrilling to see in real-time watching the monitor. I just felt like that was such a big triumph and such a core memory from that set. Just working with those kids, they were so amazing and so much fun and so game for everything. You’re a gamer, and you’re a Final Fantasy person. What was it like exploring those minute details of the 2000s? What was it like getting those old materials and putting them in your film’s set? It’s funny because those were choices by our production designers. I didn’t really have input on the games they’d actually bring. And so, it was just a connect-the-dots moment: “Oh gosh, you guys played this too.” We all had fun with it, and it made me feel more connected with my team. Getting to magically run into those details on set was such a joy because I really loved Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Square-Anything, and I love Tekken. I actually even played Tekken with our Script Supervisor at one point — that was a lot of fun. Then, at one point, I had to do my job, unfortunately, so I didn’t get to do it for long. What message or insight do you hope viewers will take away from watching your film? I don’t think I’ve ever considered any message or takeaway message or a thesis to my film so much as I wanted to impart a familiar experience. So really, what I want for anyone who watched it is I really want them to call their person and tell them they love them because I think that’s what this whole thing has been, just being able to tell my community and my family that I love them on a really ridiculous level of making a movie about it. – Rappler.com When You Left Me On That Boulevard will be premiering in the Short Film Program at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival beginning January 21, 8 am PST and online on January 24, 7 am PST.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/pastilan-opinion-marcos-recipe-kitchen-disaster/,[],"Senators want Bongbong Marcos out of the Department of Agriculture (DA), but they’re too chicken to say it as it is, the way they should, to his face. And so, they just take turns ganging up on the underlings. The man’s been in charge of the department for more than six months and things aren’t going well. Prices are soaring, crops are short, and some senators suspect a cartel’s behind it all. Lack of financing, poor rural infrastructure, and climate extremes are all contributing to this onion mess. It’s a symptom of the poor state of the nation’s agricultural economy, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of agricultural infrastructure, competition from smuggled goods, and now imports. They can’t just say, “That’s the department’s problem, not Bongbong’s.” Marcos is the one calling the shots, and he’s been too busy with his world tour that he doesn’t have time to address the pressing problems. He’s been in office for six months and he still hasn’t appointed a full-time agriculture secretary. I mean, who’s running the show over at DA? A bunch of farm animals? It’s not just the department. It’s the whole chain of command. First, it was sugar. And for the first time, this generation saw a Coke shortage. Repeat: Coke. Not cocaine. Coca-Cola. Can you imagine that? Then came onions and eggs. Salt farmers are grumbling about importation, too. It’s like a game of whack-a-mole – every time you think you had one problem solved, another one pops up its ugly head. All these happened the moment Marcos took over as DA chief. Talk about a recipe for disaster. Senators have been told that onion farmers are killing themselves; they’re up to their necks in debt, all because of a little vegetable. And what does this president do? He imports more onions like that’s going to solve the problem. It’s like pouring gasoline on a fire. The decision to import onions at this time is a short-run solution to address the present shortages and runaway prices. Can’t he see that it’s important to consider the timing so that the resulting drop in prices doesn’t ruin the income source of local farmers? Why wait until our farmers are about to harvest their onions? That’s just cruel. And what’s even crueler is seeing all these poor farmers struggling to make a living while the president does nothing but hop from one country to the next. Is he really more interested in revenge travel than helping the people? I’m trying to understand why we had a supposed shortage of almost 4,000 metric tons of onions in 2022 even though DA data show there was a surplus in 2021. There were 11,000 metric tons of onions in cold storage as part of a total of 53,000 metric tons of supposed supply. If that’s the case, as senators correctly pointed out, why didn’t any of that help with the supposed 2022 shortage? And if there was a surplus, why did they still go ahead and support importing 29,000 metric tons of onions in 2022? Aren’t cold storage facilities built to make perishable products last longer? Here is a case of the agriculture department coming out and saying there was a surplus. Then they turn around and say there was a shortage. That’s quite a load of carabao poop there. The DA’s trying to pull a fast one on us. They’re telling us there’s a shortage of onions and the prices are going up. Yet their data show otherwise. Did they really think we’d fall for it? It’s insane that the prices of locally grown red onions have gone up to as much as P700 a kilo during the Christmas season from about P90 in July, the same month Marcos was back in Malacañang. That’s roughly a 700% increase. What else went up during his first six months in office? Sugar prices. And eggs. I mean, what’s next? Garlic? Rice? At the rate things are going, forget about how his “unity” campaign slogan would push rice prices down to the P20 level. It’s beginning to look to me like Bongbong has a personal vendetta against Philippine farm products and the Filipino diet. I mean, what’s his problem? What dish or sauce made of Philippine onions, eggs, salt, and sugar does he hate so much that he wants to rid every kitchen in the country of it? Instead of importing onions, why don’t we just import agriculture experts? We’re not exactly short on people who know how to grow things. We have plenty of experts in this country, but for some reason, they’re not in charge. And while we’re at it, let’s import some common sense, too. Because if you’re going to import onions, at least do it at the right time. There’s a poverty of leadership and expertise in the agriculture department, plain and simple. And you know what the root cause of that is? A politician who never dirtied his hands on a farm, that’s what. Bongbong Marcos never had real job experience outside of politics. He never had to worry about how he would get to work in the morning, especially when rats and roaches are everywhere, struggling to stay afloat in the flood. Not once did he dip his clean toes into muddy waters. The ousted prince-turned-king had it all handed to him on a silver platter. He never had to work for a living, never had to invest in anything with his own hard-earned money, and never built a company from scratch. Yet somehow, he ends up running the damn agriculture department and calling the shots for the farmers. How the hell does that work? It’s the farmers who are really at the losing end here. They’re the ones dealing with the debt, the losses, and even the suicides. For all their back-breaking work, what do they get in return? A government that imports more, and makes it harder for them to compete. It’s like they’re being punished for trying to make a living. It’s time for this president to step aside and for someone with real expertise and experience to take the helm. And it’s time for the government to start taking this agricultural crisis seriously and start making real changes. Let’s just hope that the next time there’s a vegetable crisis, the government will know how to handle it without f***ing the farmers up. In the meantime, Bongbong can beat his imported eggs, and sit pretty while he enjoys watching the rest of us struggle to find onions in the market.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-slingshot-scammed-sandra-cam/,[],"Shedding tears in her press conference while surrounded by three lawyers, Sandra Cam said she found God in her 20 months of incarceration. Her cell was right next door to former senator Leila de Lima’s, the woman whom she helped put in jail. She said she went through the realization that she was “used as a tool for the imprisonment of De Lima.” “Used.” Wait let’s put that in perspective. Who used her? What exactly did these users ask her to do? She gives no names and no details. That is double-speak and not a real repentance. Let’s review her timeline. In November 2016, Cam said she had three new sex videos of De Lima with three different men that she will play during the Senate probe on the then senator. Her threat to De Lima was acerbic: “If she dares me, right then and there I will show it.” Cam claimed having the videos as early as 2014 when she opposed De Lima’s confirmation hearings at the Commission on Appointments for justice secretary. But an interesting twist developed in 2016 when Rodrigo Duterte began his shaming vengeance against De Lima. The story on the alleged sex videos was bruited about by known pro-Duterte blogs and Facebook fan pages “President Rodrigo ‘Rody’ Roa Duterte Supporters,” “Diehard Duterte Supporters,” “Duterte Balita,’ and “Duterte Defenders.” In other words, the Duterte troll battalions released the fake news bombshell. But who supplied them with the alleged sex videos? Only one person had previously possessed such material – Sandra Cam. She used the power of fake news but not the power of substance, because when you clicked on the link to these videos, all that you could see was a “13-minute and 36-second video compilation of two news reports about Sandra Cam, the president of the Whistleblowers Association of the Philippines.” It was a hasty and shabby conspiracy with the Duterte camp. Of course there was no such video of Leila de Lima. I had seen one purported video. That was no Leila de Lima there but a character who the conspirators thought was her look-alike. But because Duterte trolls gobbled up the fake news like the speed of light, the burlesque forgery became gospel truth. Then in March 2017 was the time she made a scene at the airport. Flying to Masbate, she wanted the privilege of the airport’s VIP Lounge. The lady at the reception asked her for a government ID and this was customary. She had none.  But this was her mistake: she said she had no government-issued ID, but in three months she will have because she “will be a member of the cabinet.” My! That was the most outlandish thing to say. She was only a VIP wannabe, but was already throwing her weight around as though she was God’s gift to the Filipino people. That was an instant red flag there. Only the nefarious behave that way. In lashing at the girl during her tirade, she tried to drop names. That was when her big mouth disclosed a detail: Bong Go. That indicated she was indeed soliciting a government appointment through Duterte’s notorious man Friday. She also told the airport staff (quoting the news report on Cam’s own clarification) “to search her name on Google so she would recognize the whistleblower.” The problem with that is when you type “Sandra Cam” on search engines, here’s what comes out: “Sandra Cam (born June 30, 1972 in Ougrée, Liège, Belgium) is a Belgian retired freestyle swimmer who represented her country in two consecutive Summer Olympics, in Barcelona, Spain (1992) and Atlanta, United States (1996).” Who came rapidly to her defense? Duterte. “Her behavior? Let the public judge it,” he said. “She helped me, I’ll help her. And it’s not erased just because she was shouting there. That’s her business. If she would ask me for work, I would give her the work.” The question begs: what exactly did she help Duterte with, aside from helping in his presidential campaign as he claimed she did? Nine months later, on December 2017, Duterte indeed appointed Cam, but not to a cabinet position. It was to one of those token positions usually given to political benefactors – member of the board of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Was that the quid pro quo for conspiring with Duterte to bring down De Lima on false and invented charges? When she was released from prison for non-bailable murder charges this week, there was still one favored treatment she got. Police escorted her to her residence once she got out from the PNP Custodial Center. Why the VIP treatment? So it is true that the Philippine National Police is still very much a Duterte loyalist clique? And then she ended her press conference: “I want to thank the former president – my president – PRRD, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (she weeps at this point). Salamat po, Tatay Digong, sa pagbigay mo sa akin ng pag-asa, at pag prove ng sarili ko sa government service. Hindi ko po makakalimutan ito. At sana po one of these days I will see you at may ikukumpisal ako sayo, na ikaw lang ang gusto kong makausap.” The queen of scam Sandra Cam now wants us to believe she is contrite for her sins. No, Ma’am, that is no true remorse. You must reveal first who used you. Duterte? Vitaliano Aguirre? They are on their way to their International Criminal Court conviction, the trial of which is expected to commence this year, per sources from The Hague. You have nothing to lose if you name them. So no, Ms. S. Cam, your asking for forgiveness cannot be granted. #FreeLeilaDeLimaNow – Rappler.com"

The Rockets committed 7 of their 23 turnovers in the fourth quarter to grease the skids of their 13th consecutive loss. The Timberwolves, who have won eight of 11 overall, scored 30 points off those turnovers and improved to 7-1 at home this month. Edwards shot 17-of-29 and made 8-of-16 three-pointers. He added 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, and 3 blocks to his ledger. Nathan Knight scored a season-high 19 points with 3 steals off the bench, helping the Timberwolves overcome the absences of Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns. Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 19 points, 16 rebounds, and 7 assists, but he scored just one point in the fourth quarter. Jalen Green missed 10-of-13 shots and committed 6 turnovers en route to his 10-point effort. The Rockets also missed 14 free throws.

Kazakhstan’s Rybakina advanced to the quarterfinals of the season’s opening Grand Slam for the first time with an impressive display against the misfiring Pole. Rybakina, seeded 22nd, will fight for a semifinal spot against Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko, who stunned American teen star Coco Gauff, 7-5, 6-3. “It was a really tough match and I really respect Iga because of the strike she has and the Grand Slams,” said Rybakina. “She’s a young player and she plays really well. Today I think was serving also good, just struggling on one side. “Then in the important moments I played really well and it made a difference.” Ostapenko, meanwhile, has struggled to reach the heights of her French Open-winning days but the 17th seed simply overpowered Gauff by putting on a power-hitting clinic at Margaret Court Arena. The Latvian was ruthless in the finish, unleashing a thumping forehand down the line to bring up match point, then clipping the line with a crosscourt forehand winner to give Gauff no chance. “I always knew and believed in my game,” Ostapenko told reporters. “If I play well, I can beat almost anyone. I was trying to work more on my consistency, especially in the pre-season. Yeah, just to step on the court and play my game. “I think I’m doing it quite well this week,” added Ostapenko, who stunned the world in 2017 when she beat Simona Halep in the French Open final before being written off as a “one-Slam wonder” for failing to make much of an impression at the majors in recent years. A downcast Gauff converted only one of eight break points and was reduced to tears in the post-match media conference. It was a big setback for the highly fancied American after reaching the final at Roland Garros and the US Open quarterfinals. “When you play a player like her and she plays really well, it’s like, you know, there’s nothing you can do,” said Gauff. “I feel like it was rough … So it’s a little bit frustrating on that part.” Swiatek, the reigning French Open and US Open champion, got off to a rough start, surrendering her opening service game after receiving a warning from the chair umpire over the time she took for her pre-match preparations. She fought back to level the scores by the fourth game but Rybakina would break again, clinically punishing the Pole’s second serve to take the opening set. Swiatek looked to have recovered after she rattled off three straight games at the start of the second set behind a more aggressive forehand, only for Rybakina to haul herself level with another break of serve. The Russia-born right-hander broke Swiatek again at 4-4 in the second set before holding her own serve in convincing fashion to close out the match. Rybakina’s win sees her progress to a third Grand Slam quarterfinal having also reached the last eight at the 2021 French Open before winning Wimbledon last year. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/india-blocks-bbc-documentary-narendra-modi-india/,[],"MUMBAI, India – India has blocked the airing of a BBC documentary which questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership during the 2002 Gujarat riots, saying that even sharing of any clips via social media is barred. Directions to block the clips from being shared have been issued using emergency powers available to the government under the country’s information technology rules, said Kanchan Gupta, an adviser to the government, on his Twitter handle on Saturday, January 21. While the BBC has not aired the documentary in India, the video was uploaded on some YouTube channels, Gupta said. The government has issued orders to Twitter to block over 50 tweets linking to the video of the documentary and YouTube has been instructed to block any uploads of the video, Gupta said. Both YouTube and Twitter have complied with the directions, he added. Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when it was gripped by communal riots that left more than 1,000 people dead, by government count – most of them Muslims. The violence erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire, killing 59. Human rights activists estimate at least double that number died in the rioting. Modi denied accusations that he failed to stop the rioting. A special investigation team appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate the role of Modi and others in the violence said in a 541-page report in 2012 it could find no evidence to prosecute the then chief minister. Modi was named the candidate for prime minister of his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in 2013 and led it to power in general elections in 2014 and then in 2019. Last week, a spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry termed the BBC documentary a “propaganda piece” meant to push a “discredited narrative.” – Rappler.com"

Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer: Getting over first love is difficult. It started in high school; he wanted to court me, but I had declined. Dating wasn’t my priority then. But I admired Mario. Years passed but my feelings were deep-rooted. I fell in love with him but was unsure whether Mario felt the same. We never really had a proper conversation about our feelings even when we had reached legal age. But I kept on waiting, despite the uncertainty. Then news came that he had someone, so I kept my distance. But then they broke up! I waited for him again. Pathetic, but I just couldn’t get away from the thought of “us.” The guy eventually went to our house in 2020 but he never told me his intentions. I confronted him regarding the “signals” I’ve received; I told him I wasn’t happy with how he confused me: saying he loves me on our batch GC, but not pursuing me directly; looking for me at home, but unclear about his intentions. I messaged him all this, but he did not respond, I felt unimportant, neglected, rejected. After a day, I blocked him. Until now I want that response. I don’t know how to move forward. My colleagues throw men at me, saying I should date, but I can’t. I’ve reserved my future for him. Pathetic. I want to date, but I also know that I am not ready to do so. I don’t want the other party to be my rebound; I want to date wholeheartedly. But how? I am now 25. Since I was 15, the only man I set my eyes on, was him. Never had a boyfriend; I wanted him to be my first and last. So, how can I get over him? Sunset ————————— Dear Sunset, Thank you for your letter. Professor Robert Sternberg, author of the Sternberg Triangular Theory of Love, identifies three principal components of love: passion, commitment, and intimacy. This theory describes commitment alone as empty love, while commitment and passion (but no intimacy, physical or otherwise) constitute fatuous love. While it is perhaps unclear whether or not you have ever felt any true passion for this man, what is clear is that you recognize the futility of your feelings for him since you want to move on. You have decided that after 10 years of  commitment without reciprocity, enough is enough and so you want to date. While you are rightly concerned about rebounding, this should not be an obstacle because it is easily resolved. Date a few men and any possibility of a rebound will be reduced and eventually disappear completely. If this fails to resolve your problem, try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This works well with obsessive compulsive disorders (like your all-or-nothing thinking e.g. as he didn’t answer you within a day, you blocked him) and should help you over your unrequited feelings. All the best,
JAF Baer Dear Sunset: Thank you very much for your letter where you share some very strong feelings (presumptions) about yourself: 1. You are deeply romantic; hence you “can’t” let go of this deep-rooted love despite the years and the uncertainty. 2. You are a woman of integrity, which is why you kept your distance when he had someone, and only waited for him when they broke up. Also why you declined when he wanted to court you in high school. 3. You are straightforward and like clarity; unlike Mario who even went to your house and yet did not state his intentions when there and gives confusing signals. Because he did not respond to you within a day, you blocked him. This gives the impression that you do not suffer fools gladly. But is Mario really as inept a communicator as you say? He communicated clearly enough in high school that he wanted to court you. Not having a proper conversation about each others’ feelings in your twenties would have been your responsibility as much as his. Is it possible that, accepting that you did not want to be courted, he moved on and thus felt no need to further clarify his feelings? I also wonder why you chose to message him all your complaints, rather than telling him when he was at your place?  Surely that would have been the more straightforward thing to do. If it was because you needed time to gather your thoughts, couldn’t you have given Mario the same time before blocking him after just one day? That is an issue of fairness, but another issue could be courage, the ability to take (criticism) as much as dish it. After all, who knows how inspired Mario would have been to answer as straightforwardly if it had been in person? You do not have to answer all the questions I’ve asked you, dearest Sunset. However, it would be a good idea to start questioning many of your presumptions about relationships in general, about Mario in particular, and especially about yourself. Going back to some presumed basics is one of the best ways to move on. Please forgive if I come across as harsh or cryptic. That’s because there’s so much to share, Sunset. Please write us again? I would welcome it, even if (especially if) it meant having to question some basic presumptions about myself too. All the best,

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/chinese-new-year-celebrations-worldwide/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Chinese communities worldwide celebrate the Lunar or Chinese New Year on January 22, 2023. Towns and cities around the world with predominant Chinese communities celebrate the coming of spring with fireworks, red lanterns, and lion dances that are said to bring good luck and fortune. As the propagation of Chinese culture to different parts of the world happened at different points in time, the culture and tradition that was brought with them also vary. How do these different communities worldwide celebrate the Chinese New Year? A Chinatown emerged in London much younger than others during the 1970s. The London Chinatown Chinese Association in the UK hosts the annual London Chinese New Year Celebration. Organized mainly in the iconic Trafalgar Square, the celebration boasted to be the biggest gathering of Chinese lions and dragons in Europe. On the other hand, New York, USA is home to the biggest Chinatowns in the world, spread throughout at least six enclaves, according to the New York Times. The annual Chinatown parade in Manhattan is celebrating its 25th anniversary this 2023. Chinatown, Manhattan had been in existence since the 1850s, with Chinese immigrants coming into the States during the California Gold Rush settling far east. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is organizing a series of events for the holiday, including a lion dance, shadow theater, Chinese calligraphy, and a tea ceremony demonstration. The Sara D. Roosevelt street, a part of the Manhattan Chinatown, will be set alight with firecrackers, which are believed to ward off evil spirits. Chinatowns in Johannesburg, South Africa and Melbourne, Australia also have their own celebrations during the new year. Eastern Russia is home to the Buryat, a Mongolian ethnic group who mostly reside in Ulan-Ude, Republic of Buryatia, bordering Lake Baikal. They celebrate the Sagaalgan, similar to the Chinese New Year. Translated as the “White Month,” this Buddhist tradition also celebrates the end of winter, and the coming of spring. The month-long celebration happens in datsans, or Buddhist temple-universities. A khural, or prayer service, is held 2 days before the new year, according to the Calvert Journal. It is then followed by the dugzhuub, a ritual where a large bonfire is lit to cast out evil spirits and misfortune. Families often stay up all night and have celebrations at home as well as eating white-themed dishes such as buuzy, a kind of meat dumpling. A festival is held the day after, despite still freezing below-zero temperatures. The Sagaan Ubgen, or the White Elder, goes around to greet and wish people good fortune for the coming year. Koreans take influence from the Chinese, as they celebrate Seollal, or the Korean New Year on the same date. The three-day holiday is focused on family, with many returning home to celebrate together. On the first day of the new year, younger Koreans pay respect to their elders through sebae, or bowing deeply on their knees. In response, elders would give a gift, in the form of money, tokens, or words of wisdom. Koreans also pay respects to their ancestors through charye, where food is laid out as offering, then bow in reverence to their forebears. Food always comes with celebrating the new year. Dishes like tteokguk, when eaten turns you a year older; jeon, a savory pancake dish containing spring onions with a mix of either kimchi or seafood; and japchae, a spicy noodle dish eaten to signify living a long life. Translating to the art of costume and masquerade, the Chingay Parade is an after-party celebration of the Chinese New Year. Tracing its origins to a Chinese parade in Penang, Malaysia in 1912. It was originally a performance of balancing a huge flag, but over time had evolved into a parade involving local Malays and Indians. In Singapore, Chingay is celebrated 2 weeks after the Chinese New Year. It was developed by then-prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1973 as an alternative to the banned use of firecrackers the year prior. The Singaporean Chingay in 1976 invited other ethnic communities in the city-state to join in on the festivities. They also invited Japanese performers in 1987 as part of efforts to invite international talent to the parade. The Filipino Chinese New Year is celebrated much like the rest, with an addition of Catholic and superstitious beliefs. As the celebration this year falls on a Sunday, many Chinese-Filipino churches celebrate mass in Mandarin, as well as having an ancestral veneration, where food and wine are offered to an altar as a sign of respect. In Ongpin, stores are filled to the brim with incense sticks, joss or incense papers, and various anting-anting being sold to passers-by. The celebration in the world’s oldest Chinatown is always a day-long affair, with roads closed off to give way to the different parades and performances throughout the day. In China, the Chinese New Year is a massive affair. Known as Chunyun or the Spring Travel, hundreds of millions of Chinese take by land, air, and sea to be with their family for the New Year. All the food eaten during this time symbolizes something, such as oranges for good luck, noodles for a long life, and niangao (also known as tikoy) for a prosperous year. The liberal use of red and fireworks during the celebration stems from the belief that it was able to ward of beasts who would prey on villagers every year. Celebrations last for 15 days, starting with family dinners, exchanging of red envelopes (known as angpao locally), and ends with the Lantern festival on the 15th day. The different ways in which we celebrate the Chinese New Year shows the diversity of culture. It is not a homogenous tradition, but is rather molded and formed by communities who make it their own. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/dj-patty-tiu-retires-last-spin/,[],"CLARK FREEPORT – Filipino DJ Patty Tiu has been setting the tone for events and parties in Manila’s night clubs since 2011. On Saturday, January 21, she spun the turntables for the last time to culminate her DJ career at an electronic dance music festival at Howlers Manila. In her Facebook account, Patty said she plans to dedicate her remaining days to helping change the world. “My body can’t take it anymore, and as much as I want to keep it all, I’m going to have to choose, and because I know I’ve done it all, especially what I said I was going to do in DJing,” said Tiu, who has been battling esophageal cancer. “It is time to answer my bigger calling. To focus and dedicate my remaining days to what will change communities, an entire society, even globally,” the 33-year-old DJ explained. When doctors told Patty of her cancer more than a decade ago, she grabbed at every opportunity life threw her way to keep the turntables spinning. As people bop and groove to her beats, few know of the struggle in the DJ box. In the darkest corner of her booth, an empty pail stands, ready for Patty to grab it during emergencies when everything in her has to come up. Then she comes back within minutes, giving people more joy. During an interview in August last year, Patty told Rappler that at this stage in her life, her symptoms were starting to show more frequently. The doctor told her that the high grade cancerous cells would begin to spread in different areas, and that she only has five to eight years to live. The first diagnosis came in 2011, the year she started her DJ career.       . Patty decided not to undergo chemotherapy. She has, however, undergone a total of five surgeries – three of which were major operations. A gastronomy tube in her stomach helps achieve her nutritional goals. “I’ve always known that eventually it will lead to this because of the nature of what happened to me,” Tiu told Rappler. “I can’t eat solid food anymore, mostly soft and liquidated. I am dizzy most of the time, chest and abdominal pains, apart from throwing up blood.” “I was already 22 years old when I found out about my cancer. I didn’t want to do the radiology route. I didn’t want to lose my mobility,” she explained. “To me, I was lucky to have been given this second life already. Whatever I’m able to do with my second life, this is it. I don’t want to put the people I love into hardship when it comes to seeking treatments or even getting a second opinion.” That focus on living is hard won. Patty had sought death as a child, had tried taking her life due to bullying from peers and classmates. “It started as early as eight years old. I guess in that era, there was no mental health awareness. It’s either baliw ka (you’re crazy) or why would you think of such a thing at a very very young age? Patty struggled between being alone and her desire for belongingness and acceptance. “I was having troubles in high school. You know when you are a teenager, you think that your campus is your entire world. And when you get embarrassed or get bullied, and you feel like you don’t have any friends, you don’t have a specific clique, you don’t have the support system,” she shared. “It was that and nagpatong-patong na kasi (all the problems piled up and) I didn’t feel like I’m supposed to be alive. I feel like I’m always disappointing my parents, I feel like I’m not good enough.” She survived a suicide attempt but ended up with damaged internal organs. During one of her regular post-operative visits, Patty’s heart stopped as her heart rate monitor registered a flatline. She stayed at the intensive care unit for six months under coma. Even with effects that would never completely heal, Patty struggled and worked hard to achieve her goals. Grateful to be given a second chance, she found hope and went on to accept her lot in life. Leaving the DJ booth to share her story and help young people in desperate straits is just another way this wounded but victorious woman cements her life’s song. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/chris-hipkins-confirmed-as-jacinda-ardern-replacement-as-premier/,[],"WELLINGTON – New Zealand’s ruling Labour Party on Sunday, January 22, selected Chris Hipkins to replace Jacinda Ardern as its leader and the 41st prime minister of the country. Hipkins, 44, was the only nomination for the job and his confirmation in a party meeting on Sunday, known as the Labour caucus, was largely a formality. His appointment to the top job followed the surprise resignation on Thursday by Ardern, who said she had “no more in the tank” to lead the country. “This is the biggest privilege and biggest responsibility of my life,” Hipkins said announcing his appointment. “I am energized and excited by the challenge that lies ahead.” Hipkins named Carmel Sepuloni as deputy prime minister, New Zealand’s first deputy prime minister of Pacific origin. Known as “Chippy”, Hipkins built a reputation for competence in tackling COVID-19 and was a troubleshooter for Ardern when other cabinet ministers were struggling. First elected to parliament in 2008, he became a household name fronting the government’s response to the pandemic. He was appointed health minister in July 2020 before becoming the COVID response minister at the end of the year. Sepuloni, 46, is of Samoan, Tongan and New Zealand European decent and lives in Auckland. She holds a number of portfolios, including social development and employment and arts, culture and heritage. Hipkins said the rest of his team would be announced later. Before Hipkins becomes prime minister, Ardern will tender her resignation to King Charles’ representative in New Zealand, Governor General Cindy Kiro. Kiro is to appoint Hipkins to the role and he will be sworn in. Hipkins said he will be sworn in on Wednesday. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/science-solitaire-brain-creativity-does-not-take-sides/,[],"One of the very special “moms” in my life rolls her eyes every time I utter a question about how to cook something. I think she really finds my very sincere culinary questions not just elementary but impossibly comical. And I accept that eye rolling with all humility. But in my field, one of the sure-fire triggers to roll my eyes is when I am told by someone that they are either left-brained (logical) or right-brained (artistic). Very few myths are as enduring and puzzling as that one.  Why do we lovingly hold on to and spread that myth and what is the reality? I guess thinking we are creatures who have “sided” brains, just like being right or left-handed seems like a quick, ready excuse to explain one’s strengths or deficiencies. Like when one fails to come up with the wrong share in a shared bill in a restaurant (“Oh I am left-brained so am not good in Math!”) or when one makes surgical executive decisions you do not like (“Oh that is because she is right-brained.”). But even if it makes for an attractive anchor for conversations, it is in no way based on reality. This is because of the incontrovertible fact that we have whole brains and that nothing it does ever involves just the right or left. (READ: [Science Solitaire] No template for a male or female brain) This “wholeness” is so stark in “creativity” – a trait that each of us, in varying shades and extent, possesses. We need to be creative every day in our lives, whether it is how we are going to refashion tools for doing chores in the house, getting around the limits of available resources for a project, planning adventures with your family and friends, to deep-scale or larger-scale projects like writing, designing or creating something. Creativity always involves “divergent thinking” outside of what is ordinary. We also need creativity to be happy but creativity could also be the result of having positive feelings. Creativity could be both the fuel and the destination for any of our life’s adventures. It is a permanent feature of being human.  So the popular notion that creativity resides only in the left brain is literally only a portion of the story and a half-story is a falsity, a myth. Your brain, at the very least, deserves to be acknowledged for the extraordinary wholeness it brings to your being and becoming. Many studies like this one in 2018 have proven again and again how “creativity” is wired in our “whole brain functional connectivity.” They show that “creativity” is not a left-side brain activity but an amazing maestro-esque conduction of your “salient network” of the work of your brain’s “default network” (daydreaming, imagining”) and your “executive network (logic, filtering of what is feasible, logistics etc). Each of the 3 networks have brain parts all over our whole brain and not just on either left or right. We also forget that we have a middle part of the brain which holds some vital areas of those three networks. So if we all have whole brains, then why are some people more creative than others? Like many fundamental questions to being human, we do not know all the answers yet but we know some based on studies. One of the things we know so far is, based on studies that actually looked at brain activation and creative activities, is that people who are creative can activate the default and executive network at the SAME TIME with their salient network doing symphonic-like conducting. Apparently, this kind of co-activation between the networks gives way to a kind of thinking that is uncommon, “out of the box”.  Creative brains do the imagining and filtering at the same time. Less creative people can only activate one network at a time. This is what we see when people can generate imaginative ideas but also execute them in extraordinary ways. “Imaginative” involves maybe taking a fleeting but strking metaphor in a fictional book and applying it to a movement in music, in visual arts, in architecture or even in urban planning.  It could be taking out hard data from scientific studies and translating them into sensory sculptures that captivate us. It could be a swirling vortex of emotions that we have each been feeling brought on by a shared experience captured in undulating mountains inhabited by lush words in poetry. Highly creative people are also very interested in fields other than their own. They make the time to cross fields, listen a lot and collaborate. That is why I also think highly creative people are uncomfortable with labels as they do not really see themselves fully belonging to a well-fenced category of thinking or working. But is creativity wired at birth or can you cook it up as you live your life? Like all important questions, human creativity is not a singular story.  This nature-nurture choice is as attractive but as impoverished as the “left/ right brain” myth. So far, studies say the shape or strength of your creativity depends on BOTH what you were born with and what happens after that, which are made up of your own choices and things you do not have control of. But I think practice will NOT lessen or hurt your creativity. At the very least, it will wire you to be open or acknowledge that borders only exist in your head, and not in other people’s. When the new year turned, our lives did not drastically change. The world did not change. It is an old world with extremely serious problems and it would be “creativity” – involving our whole brains – that would spell the chances of success for us to thrive or even survive. May our whole brains get to create that new world. – Rappler.com Maria Isabel Garcia is a science writer.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/sara-duterte-urges-teachers-guide-learners-foreign-influences-internet-social-media/,[],"KALIBO, Philippines – Vice President Sara Duterte on Saturday, January 21, urged teachers to guide learners on the use of the Internet and social media amid the growing influence of foreign culture. The Education Secretary was the guest of honor in the 2023 Aklan Top Outstanding Mentors (ATOM) awards at the Capitol’s Augusto B. Legaspi Memorial Sports and Cultural Complex. “The crowd of teachers here come from different generations,” Duterte noted. “The older ones were disciplined strictly by our parents. There are also those millennials and the new generations.” “We have different disciplines. But learners nowadays are exposed to social media and the internet and are being influenced by non-Filipino culture. We should guide the learners to become better Filipinos,” she said. Duterte arrived in Aklan on Friday afternoon, staying overnight at the residence of Governor Jose Enrique Miraflores in Ibajay town. While in Ibajay, she witnessed the town’s Ati-Atihan, considered as the original celebration of the famous festival. At the awarding rites, Duterte explained her plans to improve benefits to teachers, reviewing the curriculum of primary and secondary levels, ensuring the rehabilitation of education, and spurring construction of new school buildings. She also mentioned that the Department of Education’s K to 12  program is now being reviewed to “ensure learners are employable as soon as they finish their basic education program.” Senior education program specialist Leila Pamati-an said rationale the ATOM awards celebrate teachers who show exemplary competence, extraordinary dedication to their work, and effective educational leadership. Master Teacher I Ruel Mia II of Rosal Elementary School topped the ATOM with 93.33 points, followed by SHS Teacher Grichelle Pelayo of Solido National High School, 93.15 points; Jennyfel Dinglasan of Lezo Integrated School, 92.3 points; Master Teacher II Hazel Joy Rabe of Kalibo Elementary School, 91.31 points; and Master Teacher I Eva Berlandino of Makato Integrated School with 88.44 points. Other finalists are Master Teacher I Frediecel Beltran of Balete Integrated School with 87.86 points, Teacher III Arnie Ventura of Kalibo Pilot Elementary School, 87.54 points; Master Teacher I Ruthelyn Yap of Regional Science High School for Region VI, 86.63 points; Master Teacher II Rose Ann Delima of Kalibo Elementary School, 85.84 points; and Master Teacher I Christina Iradiel of Kalibo Elementary School, 85.12 points. Winners of the Metrobank Teachers Awardees in Aklan and the Civil Service Commission Dangal ng Bayan awards sat as ATOM judges. The ATOM was organized by Aklan 2nd District Representative Teodorico Haresco Jr in honor of his mother, the late lawyer and teacher Razon Haresco, through the Razon Tumbukon Haresco Foundation. The first awarding was conducted in 2014. However, the foundation failed to organize ATOM awards from 2020-2022 because of the COVID 19 pandemic. Each of the awardees this year were given P35,000 and a plaque. For every awardee’s cash prize, P20,000 came from Haresco, P5,000 from Kalibo Mayor Juris Sucro, and P10,000 from Duterte, who announced her contribution at the end of her public address. Haresco said the ATOM has so far named 60 awardees since its founding. The ATOM is open to all Teacher I to Master Teacher II employees of the Division of Aklan, serving in regular classes, special education, indigenous people, Alternative Learning Systems, and Muslim Education, with at least five years in the public service and at least very satisfactory performance in evaluations over the last two school years. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-justice-department-found-more-classified-items-in-biden-home-search/,[],"WASHINGTON – A new search of President Joe Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware on Friday, January 20, by the United States Justice Department found six more items, including documents with classification markings, a lawyer for the president said in a statement Saturday night. Some of the classified documents and “surrounding materials” dated from Biden’s tenure in the US Senate, where he represented Delaware from 1973 to 2009, according to his lawyer, Bob Bauer. Other documents were from his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration, from 2009 through 2017, Bauer said. The Department of Justice, which conducted a search that lasted over 12 hours, also took some notes that Biden had personally handwritten as vice president, according to the lawyer. The president offered access “to his home to allow DOJ to conduct a search of the entire premises for potential vice-presidential records and potential classified material,” Bauer said. Neither Biden nor his wife were present during the search, the attorney said. Biden is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for the weekend. Justice Department investigators coordinated the search with Biden’s lawyers ahead of time, Bauer said, and the president’s personal and White House lawyers were present at the time. Other classified government records were discovered this month at Biden’s Wilmington residence, and in November at a private office he maintained at a Washington, D.C., think tank after ending his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration in 2017. On Saturday, Bauer did not make clear in his statement where in the Wilmington home the documents were found. The previous classified documents were found in the home’s garage and in a nearby storage space. The search shows federal investigators are swiftly moving forward with the probe into classified documents found in Biden’s possession. This month, US Attorney General Merrick Garland named a special counsel to probe the matter. Special counsel Robert Hur, who was appointed during the process, is investigating how the president and his team handled Obama-era classified documents that were recently found in Biden’s private possession. Biden’s lawyers found all the documents discovered before Friday’s search by the DOJ, according to the White House. The latest search was the first time federal law enforcement authorities have conducted a search for government documents at Biden’s private addresses, according to information released publicly. Republicans have compared the investigation to the ongoing probe into how former President Donald Trump handled classified documents after his presidency. The White House has noted that Biden’s team has cooperated with authorities in their probe and had turned over those documents. Trump resisted doing so until an FBI search in August at his Florida resort. The search escalates the legal and political stakes for the president, who has insisted that the previous discovery of classified material at his home and former office would eventually be deemed inconsequential. Biden said on Thursday he has “no regrets” about not publicly disclosing before the midterm elections the discovery of classified documents at his former office and he believed the matter will be resolved. “There is no there, there,” Biden told reporters during a trip to California on Thursday. Since the discovery of Biden’s documents, Trump has complained that Justice Department investigators were treating his successor differently. “When is the F.B.I. going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?” Trump said in a social media post earlier this month. – Rappler.com"

In addition to the weekly show, which airs US-wide on cable channels The Filipino Channel (TFC) and ANC, as well as on local Southern CA digital channel KNET 25.1, So Jannelle has stepped up its social media engagement through Instagram Reels at @sojannelletv, delivering exclusive content which dives even deeper into the subjects that Filipinos abroad care about. Filipino-American media pioneer Jannelle So Perkins took a look back at some of the engaging content that was shared through Reels in 2022, as she spoke with the leading entertainers, politicians and business people who shape their communities. Among the most memorable interviews was with Eric Bauza, the Filipino-Canadian voice actor who has portrayed Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and a number of other iconic characters. Bauza taught So Perkins how to perform Dino’s bark from The Flintstones by inhaling before barking. She also sat down with stars of the movie Easter Sunday, a comedy that allowed Hollywood staples Lou Diamond Phillips and Tia Carrere to connect with their Filipino heritage on air. Carrere revealed that her favorite Filipino term was “tarantado,” while theater veteran Lydia Gaston related how “Ang bagal bagal mo” became a popular expression on set after she began saying it to Jo Kay for not moving fast enough. Phillips kept it simple, picking “Oo, talaga” because “the other ones are all bad.” Speaking of revealing, Joshua dela Cruz, the Filipino-American actor who starred in last year’s Blue’s Big City Adventure, told So Perkins about how an old photo of him looking buff during his days on stage made the rounds, casting the children’s TV superstar in a sexy light. “It’s very flattering and I never thought that I would ever be looked at in that capacity,” Dela Cruz said, agreeing with So Perkins that he might as well “own it.” So Perkins was also on location in New York City when Jollibee opened its US flagship location in Times Square, attracting not just Filipino patrons hungry for a familiar taste, but curious visitors from around the world eager to try out the fast-growing fried chicken chain. The diverse crowd that waited on line for opening day demonstrated the brand’s broadening appeal, while creating a foothold for Filipino cuisine in one of the world’s most visited tourist locations. Another big beat for the show in 2022 was her interviews with beauty queens. So Perkins interviewed Miss Universe Philippines Celeste Cortesi, Miss Nevada Kataluna Enriquez, and Miss New Mexico Suzanne Perez, who, in addition to shedding light on how they overcome life’s hurdles and insecurities, demonstrated how to properly slay on the runway. Other fun segments included her sit-down with the “DonBelle” duo Donny Pangilinan and Belle Mariano during their first ever tour of the United States to promote a film. The actors engaged in a game of “Who’s Most Likely To…” which saw both actors point towards each other as the most likely to be jealous, among other inquiries. No look back at the past year would be complete without reminiscing on SB19’s appearance on the show, when the Filipino boy band revealed that the artist that they’d most want to collaborate with is Bruno Mars, because of his ability to sing and dance simultaneously.

Emotions ran high as Cagayan de Oro Mayor Rolando Uy officiated the mass wedding for the couples who all came dressed for the occasion with their families. “Maybe it was love at first sight. We just met a couple of months ago,” Aceron said. Daayata, 64, said his first wife died in August 2022 and by that time he met the 58-year-old Aceron in November that same year, he thought it was time to move on. Aceron lost her husband to cancer and has been a widow for a year. “Our children are already old, and they did not pose any objections to our marriage,” she said. Daayata and Aceron won the P5,000 prize for the longest kiss contest among the couples. Each couple went home with a lechon, bag of groceries, 10-kilogram bag of rice, cake, and P5,000 in assistance from city hall, which has been organizing these mass weddings. Uy said he supports this program because families are the foundations of a stable society. “A good family becomes productive unlike broken homes,” said Uy, who has been supporting the program after he was first elected chairman of Barangay Carmen in the city in the 1990s. The local government’s mass wedding program aims to help low-income couples who may not have the means to afford a traditional wedding ceremony. The program also provides counseling and support for the newlywed couples to help them strengthen their relationships and build stable families. Uy said the city government plans to hold more mass wedding events in the future, as part of its efforts to promote family values and build stronger communities. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-results-novak-djokovic-grigor-dimitrov-australian-open-january-21-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic continued his charge towards a 10th Australian Open title with a superb 7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-4, victory over Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov to reach the fourth round on Saturday, January 21, but fears about the durability of his injured left hamstring only grew. The Serbian, who is eyeing a 22nd major to match Rafa Nadal, said he felt “up and down” physically during the three hours and seven minutes he was on court as Dimitrov searched in vain for his second win over the fourth seed in their 11th meeting. Fourth seed Djokovic looked uncertain in his movement during a roller-coaster first set where he began with a break, squandered 3 set points at 5-3 and dropped serve late on before edging a thrilling tiebreak. “Well it (the tiebreak) was as important as any other game. But I think that probably was one of the most important moments in the match,” Djokovic told reporters. “To prevail in the tiebreak and get a set ahead. Being a set down or a set up is a big difference. Mentally and physically… Kind of went up and down feeling physically with my leg.” “I just found a way to win in such an exciting match, big battle, over three hours for three sets. If I lost one of these sets, we could have gone the distance. God knows how long.” “We already had some matches over five hours during this tournament. This looked to be another one. I’m really fortunate to get through in straight sets.” A heavily-strapped but more aggressive Djokovic emerged from a medical timeout and built pressure with his relentless returns from the back, going up 4-2 as 27th seed Dimitrov hit the net to surrender his serve, and went on to wrap up the second set. A half-fit Djokovic can still be a handful for most players but he looked a little more certain of his mobility in the third set and a double break to start put him on the front foot before he limped to his chair and had treatment again at 4-1. Dimitrov sprayed the errors – 50 in total – but continued to ask questions and won the next two games as the groans from the 35-year-old Djokovic grew louder during every point. But an incredible 31-shot rally set up match point and Djokovic finally subdued his opponent to book a clash with Australian Alex de Minaur. “Well, it kind of always starts well in the last few matches, including this one, and then some movement happens and then it gets worse,” the Serbian said about playing with his injury. “Pills kick in, some hot cream and stuff. That works for a little bit, then it doesn’t, then works again. It’s really a rollercoaster, honestly.” Djokovic said that it was draining to deal with matches in a less than ideal physical state. “But it is what it is. It’s kind of a circumstances that you have to accept,” he added. “I’m just grateful that I’m actually able to play. The way it looked just before the tournament started, I thought that it wouldn’t be possible.” “I’m still here and still holding on.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/what-is-it-like-have-pet-philippine-forest-dog/,['AMANDA T. LAGO'],"MANILA, Philippines – To many people, the asong gubat or Philippine forest dog is more of a myth than a reality. With their tiger-striped coats, sharp claws, and ability to climb trees and hunt animals, this dog sounds like it’s too wild to be tamed. And yet a number of people have been caring for the asong gubat as pets, after falling in love with this purely Filipino breed. Marc Ebuenga has been taking care of asong gubat Sigbin for a year now, bringing him home as a two-month-old puppy. Marc used to take care of Jack Russell Terriers, but took an interest in Philippine forest dogs after seeing them in a TV feature. From then on, he began doing his research on the breed, and later took in Sigbin – named after a blood-sucking monster from Visayan folklore – who was part of a litter of an older Philippine Forest Dog. “Gusto ko talaga ‘yung pang-outdoor na aso, mga active,” Marc told Rappler at the Philippine Canine Club’s (PCCI) Philippine Circuit, where the asong gubat was presented on January 14. “Siyempre, Pilipino tayo, so doon na ako sa Philippine forest dog.” (I really like outdoorsy, active dogs. Of course, we’re Filipino, so I chose the Philippine forest dog.) Unlike aspins, which are mongrels, the asong gubat is a purebred dog, with indigenous dog researcher Tom Asmus positing that the breed could have been around for 36,000 years. Like other purebred dogs, the asong gubat has predictable traits – from their looks to their temperament. As Marc shared, they make great guard dogs, because they are loyal to their families, but wary of strangers. He said it’s better to start taking care of them at a younger age (two months), rather than older, so they can bond better with their humans. They are also great with kids. Marc shared that his young daughter is Sigbin’s true “alpha” – he listens more to her than anyone else in the family. At the Philippine Circuit, the two were undeniably close, with the girl cuddling up to Sigbin any chance she could get. “Mabait siya sa bata. Malambing siya sa bata, sa family lang, pero sa ibang tao, hindi. Protective talaga siya,” Marc shared. (He’s good with kids. He’s sweet with kids within the family, but not with strangers. He’s really protective.) The asong gubat’s hunting instinct is very much alive, and Marc says that Sigbin keeps their house free from cockroaches and rats. They’re also very healthy dogs. “Naaaksidente lang siya. Pero malakas ‘yung resistensya niya compared sa other dogs. Siyempre kailangan pa rin ng mga vaccine, kumpletuhin, para sure ka,” Marc said. (He gets into accidents, but his immune system is strong compared to other dogs. Of course, you still need to complete their vaccines, to be sure.) Aside from being healthy, the asong gubat is also very active, which means their owners need to be, too. “Nandoon pa rin ‘yung…hindi naman wild, medyo wild ng konti, kasi nasa dugo din nila ‘yung hunting, ganoon. Pero kaya naman. Ang kagandahan kasi, agile sila, so hindi sila napapagod. Kunwari mahilig ka sa trekking, sila ‘yung best,” Marc said. (Their wildness is still there. Not so wild, just a little bit wild, because hunting is in their blood. But they’re manageable. The beauty is, they’re agile, so they don’t get tired. If you like trekking, they’re the best.) The PCCI is hoping that the Philippine forest dog becomes the first dog breed from the country to be recognized by the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI), the organization that manages national kennel clubs around the world. When that happens, perhaps more people will be choosing the asong gubat as a pet. Like other breeds, taking care of this unique dog breed comes with its own set of challenges, but with the right families, they can also be just as loved. – Rappler.com"

Francis “LeBron” Lopez transferred from Ateneo to the University of the Philippines (UP) after some “curveballs and a few distractions” in the last two years. “After spending quality time with family and close friends during the holidays, it has given me the opportunity to seriously take stock of my life as well as the options available for my future, both for my education and basketball career,” Lopez said in a statement on Saturday, January 21. “My basketball path has been unpredictable the past two years as I finish my high school education. Life has thrown curveballs and a few distractions that has made me a stronger and better person.” Lopez, one of the youngest stalwarts in the Gilas Pilipinas pool, said former UP star Carl Tamayo played a pivotal role in his decision aside from his “heart-to-heart discussions” with family and friends. The 19-year-old Lopez thanked Tamayo – his Gilas teammate who recently bid UP farewell to play in the Japan B. League – “for the guidance and great stories” that made him realize that he wanted “to pursue my college education in UP.” Lopez previously signed to join Overtime Elite but did not leave the Philippines to join the team. Multiple sources believe the contract has been nullified. The big announcement came on the same night Ateneo was celebrating its latest UAAP championship with a traditional bonfire party. The Blue Eagles dethroned the Fighting Maroons in the best-of-three men’s basketball finals last December. “UP is a great institution with a very good basketball program and management group. I know deep in my heart that the UP Nowhere to Go But Up Foundation will take care of me as a student and as an athlete,” said Lopez. – Rappler.com"

League ended in defeat as the Levanga Hokkaido bowed to the Yokohama B-Corsairs, 98-82, on Saturday, January 21. The Gilas Pilipinas guard got sidelined for two months after sustaining an ankle injury last November 20 in a loss to Matthew Wright and the Kyoto Hannaryz and missed 19 straight games. Ramos struggled in his first game back, scoring just 2 points on a 1-of-8 clip to go with 2 rebounds in over 17 minutes of play as Hokkaido absorbed its seventh straight defeat and fell to 7-14. Kyoto also fell prey despite a superb offensive performance from Wright in an 88-81 loss to the Gunma Crane Thunders. Wright finished with a game-high 25 points on top of 4 assists and 2 rebounds, but the Hannaryz frittered an 11-point lead away as it dropped to 12-19. Ray Parks, on the other hand, helped the Nagoya Diamond Dolphins stretch their win run to four consecutive games following a 90-71 mauling of the Ibaraki Robots. Parks made his presence felt with 7 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 assists for Nagoya, which sits at sixth place in the entire B. League with a 23-8 record. Like Ramos and Wright, victories also eluded brothers Kiefer and Thirdy Ravena, with the Shiga Lakes and the San-En NeoPhoenix suffering a pair of double-digit losses. Kiefer tallied 11 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals in the Lakes’ 108-80 blowout defeat to the Shimano Susanoo Magic, while Thirdy put up 5 points and 5 rebounds as the NeoPhoenix lost to the Sunrockets Shibuya, 103-93. Over in the second division, only Jordan Heading clinched a win among the Filipino imports for the day, with the respective teams of Greg Slaughter, Kobe Paras, and Roosevelt Adams all losing. Heading fired 13 points as the Nagasaki Velca pulled off a 101-94 victory over the Bambitious Nara. Paras and the Altiri Chiba tripped against the Ehime Orange Vikings, 79-76, while Slaughter and the Rising Zephyr Fukuoka stumbled versus the Aomori Watts, 81-75. Adams and Kagawa Five Arrows fell short in a 72-71 loss to the Koshigaya Alphas. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/astrology/year-of-the-rabbit-predictions-2023/,[],"This coming Sunday, January 22, we enter the year of the Water Rabbit. Some say it is the year of the Black Rabbit. So don’t hoard that childhood candy called White Rabbit just yet. According to Chinese Astrology, the rabbit symbolizes patience and luck. 2023 will bring qualities that may have been lacking in the previous year, such as peace and success. We expect this year to be less dramatic or tumultuous than the last Year of the Tiger. The young Baguio boy Adriel Jose Angelo Trinidad, who is acknowledged as one of only two accredited masters in the Philippines by the International Feng Shui Association, told us to think of a rabbit drinking dew on a leaf. That is how fragile and charming this year will be. If the past two years had us cowering in fear and saving our strength, now is the best time to be achieving our goals and realizing our plans. But how can we realize our plans when we cannot even afford onions? We are in the Philippines, which in the past two presidencies, seemed to have lucked out. We have been six months into the Marcos presidency and we feel like the rabbits along Session Road on Sundays expecting to be kept as pets or slaughtered as food anytime. Trinidad said that he cannot divine the feng shui of the country but he surely can do so with our president, Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., who seems to be still in a party mood like he was as a teenager. Trinidad said that indeed our luck is with the President. And this is the party pooper: It is not going to be a good year for Bongbong. “Kumbaga, if our president is in good luck, susuwertehin tayong lahat pero kung minamalas siya, it will be more difficult,” Trinidad said. (In other words, if our president is in good luck, we will all be lucky but if he’s unlucky, it will be more difficult.) Bongbong was born in the Year of the Rooster. To be more specific, he was born on Rooster Month and Rabbit Day. Trinidad said that this is not an auspicious blend this year. A rooster is in direct clash with the rabbit. And as part of the feng shui rule, if it is your birth year, it’s not definitely your year. This is called “in conflict with the Grand Duke.” So a person born on a Rabbit Day will not be lucky on a Rabbit Year. “I do not want to give too much information here, but we are in for a very hectic ride,” Trinidad said. And boy, he also has some not-good prognostication of the City of Baguio. Like BBM, our luck goes where Magalong goes. And Trinidad said that Magalong has to take care of his health this year. Magalong was born in the Year of the Rat. In Trinidad’s chart, the rat will be directly affected by “Two Penalty.” The match of a rat and a rabbit creates a punishment group, which is called “impolite punishment” in feng shui. The two will affect each other. Trinidad cautioned the mayor to take extra care of his health. But all in all,  2023 is generally a year full of romance, illicit affairs included. Trinidad said it will also be a year full of scandals. He also mentioned that this Year of the Rabbit would bring more unpredictable weather, earthquakes, and landslides. Trinidad also shared that this year will be “a year of communication and compromise.” He explained that people will have to learn to adapt, “like the yin water” to whatever the Year of the Rabbit brings. – Rappler.com"

Coming off a rousing Slam Dunk Contest victory during the KBL All-Star festivities, Abando did not play as the league-leading Anyang absorbed its most lopsided loss of the season after back-to-back wins. Goyang jumped to a 41-32 halftime lead and never looked back thanks to four players scoring in double figures led by import Dedric Lawson, who finished with 23 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. Jeon Seong-hyen also put up 23 points for the Carrot Jumpers, who stretched their hot streak to five straight wins and improved to 18-15 for fifth place. Only two players scored in double figures for the KGC, with Byeong Jun-hyeong and former NBA player Omari Spellman recording 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the blowout defeat. Anyang remained at the top spot with a 22-10 record. Meanwhile, Ethan Alvano delivered 12 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists as the Wonju DB Promy halted a two-game skid with an 85-82 win over the Seoul Samsung Thunders in a battle between the two bottom teams in the standings. Hiking its record to 13-20 for ninth place, Wonju handed cellar-dwelling Seoul (10-23) its 10th consecutive defeat. While Alvano and the Promy held on to the narrow win, Dave Ildefonso and the Suwon KT Sonicboom suffered a heartbreaker following a 76-73 loss to the Seoul SK Knights. Ildefonso posted 5 points and 2 rebounds for Suwon, which fell short of its fourth-quarter comeback on the way to its third defeat over the last four games. The Sonicboom, who sit at seventh place with a 14-18 record, outscored the Knights 15-6 in the final period but to no avail.

https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/mexico-reporter-published-story-next-day-dead/,[],"Just after sunset on Thursday, February 10, 2022, two men in a white Dodge Ram pickup pulled up in front of Heber Lopez Vasquez’s small radio studio in southern Mexico. One man got out, walked inside, and shot the 42-year-old journalist dead. Lopez’s 12-year-old son Oscar, the only person with him, hid, Lopez’s brother told Reuters. Lopez was one of 13 Mexican journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based rights group. It was the deadliest year on record for journalists in Mexico – now the most dangerous country for reporters in the world outside the war in Ukraine, where CPJ says 15 reporters were killed last year. A day earlier, Lopez – who ran two online news sites in the southern Oaxaca state – had published a story on Facebook accusing local politician Arminda Espinosa Cartas of corruption related to her reelection efforts. As he lay dead, a nearby patrol car responded to an emergency call, intercepted the pickup and arrested the two men. One of them, it later emerged, was the brother of Espinosa, the politician in Lopez’s story. Espinosa has not been charged in connection with Lopez’s killing. She did not respond to multiple requests for comment and Reuters could not find any previous comment she made about her role in corruption or on Lopez’s story. Her brother and the other man remain detained but have yet to be tried. Their lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “I already stopped covering drug trafficking and corruption and Heber’s death still scares me,” said Hiram Moreno, a veteran Oaxacan journalist who was shot three times in 2019, sustaining injuries in the leg and back, after writing about drug deals by local crime groups. His assailant was never identified. “You cannot count on the government. Self-censorship is the only thing that will keep you safe.” It is a pattern of fear and intimidation playing out across Mexico, as years of violence and impunity have created what academics call “silence zones” where killing and corruption go unchecked and undocumented. “In silence zones, people don’t get access to basic information to conduct their lives,” said Jan-Albert Hootsen, CPJ’s Mexico representative. “They don’t know who to vote for because there are no corruption investigations. They don’t know which areas are violent, what they can say and not say, so they stay silent.” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about attacks on the media. Since the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006, 133 reporters have been killed for motives related to their work, CPJ determined, and another 13 for undetermined reasons. In that time Mexico has registered over 360,000 homicides. Aggression against journalists has spread in recent years to previously less hostile areas – such as Oaxaca and Chiapas – threatening to turn more parts of Mexico into information dead zones, say rights groups like Reporters Without Borders and 10 local journalists. Lopez was the second journalist since mid-2021 to be murdered in Salina Cruz, a Pacific port in Oaxaca. It nestles in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a skinny stretch of land connecting the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific that has become a landing spot for precursor chemicals to make fentanyl and meth, according to three security analysts and a DEA source. Lopez’s last story, one of several he wrote about Espinosa, covered the politician’s alleged efforts to get a company constructing a breakwater in Salina Cruz’s port to threaten workers to cast their vote for her reelection or else be fired. The infrastructure was a part of the Interoceanic Corridor–one of Lopez Obrador’s flagship development projects in southern Mexico. Jose Ignacio Martinez, a crime reporter in the Isthmus, and nine of Lopez’s fellow journalists say since his murder they are more afraid to publish stories delving into the corridor project, drug trafficking, and state collusion with organized crime. One outlet Reuters spoke to, which asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said it had done an investigation on the corridor, but did not feel safe to publish after Lopez’s death. Lopez Obrador’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about corruption accusations related to the corridor. In 2012 the government established the Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists. Known simply as the Mechanism, the body provides journalists with protections such as panic buttons, surveillance equipment, home police watch, armed guards, and relocation. Since 2017, nine Mechanism-protected reporters have been murdered, CPJ found. Journalists and activists may request protection from the Mechanism, which evaluates their case along with a group of human rights defenders, journalists, and representatives of nonprofits, as well as officials from various government agencies that make up a governing board. Not all those who request protection receive it, based on the analysis. At present there are 1,600 people enrolled in the Mechanism, including 500 journalists. One of those killed was Gustavo Sanchez, a journalist shot at close range in June 2021 by two motorcycle-riding assailants. Sanchez, who had written critical articles about politicians and criminal groups, enrolled in the Mechanism for a third time after surviving an assassination attempt in 2020. Protection never arrived. Oaxaca’s prosecutor at the time said Sanchez’s coverage of local elections would be a primary line of investigation into his murder. No one has been charged in the case. Sanchez’s killing triggered Mexico’s human rights commission to produce a 100-page investigation into authorities’ failings. Evidence “revealed omissions, delays, negligence, and breach of duties by at least 15 public servants,” said the report. Enrique Irazoque, head of the Interior Ministry’s department for the Defense of Human Rights, said the Mechanism accepted the findings, but highlighted the role local authorities played in the protection lag. Fifteen people within government and civil society told Reuters the Mechanism is under-resourced given the scope of the problem. Irazoque agreed, though he noted its staff of 40 increased last year to a staff of 70. Its 2023 budget increased to around $28.8 million from $20 million in 2022. In addition to the shortage of funding, Irazoque said that local authorities, state governments and courts need to do more, but there was a lack of political will. “The Mechanism is absorbing all the problems, but the issues are not federal, they are local,” he said in an interview with Reuters. More convictions are what Irazoque believes are most needed, saying the lack of legal repercussions for public officials encourages corruption. Impunity for journalist killings hovers around 89%, a 2021 report from the Interior Ministry, which oversees the Mechanism, showed. Local public servants were the biggest source of violence against journalists, ahead of organized crime, the report found. “You would think the biggest enemy would be armed groups and organized crime,” said journalist Patricia Mayorga, who fled Mexico after investigating corruption. “But really it’s the ties between those groups and the state officials that are the problem.” Many Mexican journalists killed worked for small, independent, digital outlets that sometimes only published on Facebook, noted Irazoque, saying their stories dug deep into local political issues. Mexico’s National Association of Mayors (ANAC) and its National Conference of Governors (CONAGO) did not respond to requests for comment about the role of state and local governments in journalist killings or allegations of corrupt ties to crime groups. President Lopez Obrador frequently pillories the press, calling out reporters critical of his administration and holding a weekly segment in his daily news conference dedicated to the “lies of the week.” He condemns the murders, while accusing adversaries of talking up the violence to discredit him. Irazoque says he has no evidence the president’s verbal attacks have led to violence against journalists. Lopez Obrador’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. “What type of life is this?,” journalist Rodolfo Montes said, eyeing security footage from inside his home where the Mechanism, in which he first enrolled in 2017, had installed cameras with eyes on the garage, street and entryway. Years earlier, a cartel rolled a bullet under the door as a threat, and he has been on edge ever since. An entire archive box of threats spread over a decade sat in the corner. Looking down at his phone after a cartel threatened his 24-year-old daughter just a few days before, he said, “I’m living, but I’m dead, you know?” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/no-pay-hike-teachers-serving-poll-workers-barangay-polls-october-2023/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) disclosed on Saturday, January 21, that its readjusted budget for the conduct of the long-delayed barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections will not provide for an increase in the honoraria of electoral boards. The poll body said it received from Congress only around P2.7 billion, on top of the P8.4 billion it originally had to mount the electoral exercise now set on October 30, 2023. The additional funding is significantly smaller than the P10 billion that the Comelec had said it needed in order to pay for the additional costs incurred by the rescheduling of the polls from December 2022. “We originally wanted to request that the honoraria of teachers be raised, but because of budget constraints, we decided to set a fixed amount of their pay: P6,000 for the electoral board chairmen, P5,000 for electoral board members, and P4,000 for other precinct workers,” Comelec Chairman George Garcia said in an ambush interview in Tawi-Tawi on Saturday, January 21. “But when a budget hearing commences in Congress, who knows, maybe they will allot additional compensation for electoral board members, or our teachers,” Garcia added. When Garcia told the upper chamber in October 2022 that postponing the polls by another year would incur P10 billion in additional expenses, Senate electoral reforms panel chairperson Imee Marcos called the estimate “outrageous.” In the 2022 elections, teachers’ groups decried that they were not exempted from paying a 20% withholding tax on their honoraria and allowances, resulting in a deduction from their take-home pay. The barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections have been postponed four times: the first three times under the Duterte administration, and the most recent postponement under the Marcos administration. But Garcia said he has no doubt that the October elections will finally push through. There have been 1.024 million new voter applicants since the Comelec resumed registration in December 2022. It projects to hit 1.5 million before the January 31 deadline. Garcia’s trip to Tawi-Tawi on Saturday was the first time in seven years that a poll chief set foot in the far-flung province, according to Comelec spokesman Rex Laudiangco. His visit included meetings with local election workers, and observation of voter registration activities. He is also set to visit Jolo, Sulu, on Sunday, January 22, for a similar agenda. – Rappler.com * All quotes in Filipino were translated into English and shortened for brevity."
https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-statement-clarita-carlos-resignation/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he believed that there was no plot to oust Clarita Carlos as his national security adviser, contrary to his former Cabinet official’s claim that there were people in government who were “moving against” her. Marcos made the statement in an interview with the media in Zurich, Switzerland, on Friday, January 20, when asked about Carlos’ resignation, which was reportedly prompted by constant attacks against the country’s first female national security adviser. “Well, she felt that there were people who were moving against her in government. Ako (Me), I didn’t. I kept telling her, I don’t really think so,” Marcos said. Carlos had told One News there were critics who had been trying to attack her reputation “since day 1.” The President also said that Carlos did not “enjoy” her time in government because she used to work in the academe. Carlos has moved to the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department of the House of Representatives. “And I guess…she didn’t enjoy her time in government, which you know, if we think about it, it’s not really surprising because that’s not her natural habitat. Her natural habitat is the academe. And so now, she will be in a think tank which is perfect for her,” he said. Marcos’ statement, however, contradicted Carlos’ explanation about her resignation. In an interview with broadcaster Anthony Taberna on January 15, she said that she and Marcos talked, and the President revealed a “problem” that prompted her to offer her resignation. “Of course, until last Saturday (January 14), nang nilahad sa ’kin ni Presidente na some of which, because of national security concerns, hindi natin masisiwalat…. Pero ang nangyari kasi, binigay sa ’kin ni Presidente ‘yong terrain,” Carlos said. (Of course, until last Saturday, when the President explained things to me, some of which I cannot say because of national security concerns…. But what happened was, the President gave me the terrain.) “And I said, ‘Ah, ganyan pala ‘yan. So hindi ko ‘yan alam. So Mr. President, magresign na lang ako para maresolba na ‘yang problema mo kasi wala naman, no big deal naman ‘yan. Eh ‘di I go back sa think tank ko and like that.” (And I said, ‘Ah, so that’s it. I didn’t know that. So Mr. President, I will just resign so your problem will be resolved, because it’s not a big deal. I will just go back to my think tank and like that.) Carlos added that the President told her that as the NSA, there are “factors and forces” surrounding her designation. “Sabi niya, ‘No, you should stay kasi, we really need your expertise. Kaya lang as NSA, meron talagang mga, may mga factors and forces na talagang nagwo-work around us that will make you,’ how did they put it? Hindi ko na nga matandaan.” (He said, “No, you should stay because we really need your expertise. However, as the NSA, there are other factors and forces that really work around us that make you,’ how did they put it? I don’t even remember.) Malacañang announced Carlos’ resignation exactly a week ago – on January 14 – and of the appointment of former interior secretary Eduardo Año as the new national security adviser. Carlos, a political scientist and retired University of the Philippines professor, was the first woman to handle the post, at least since the first Marcos president – the current President’s father and namesake – was in power. She was also the first National Security Council (NSC) director general in a long time to have come from the academe – most NSC chiefs have been former military officials or politicians.– Rappler.com"

The mass movement of people during the ongoing Lunar New Year holiday period may spread the pandemic, boosting infections in some areas, but a second COVID-19 wave is unlikely in the near term, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the Weibo social media platform. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are traveling across the country for holiday reunions that had been suspended under recently eased COVID-19 curbs, raising fears of fresh outbreaks in rural areas less equipped to manage large outbreaks. China has passed the peak of COVID-19 patients in fever clinics, emergency rooms and with critical conditions, a National Health Commission official said on Thursday. Nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital as of January 12, roughly a month after China abruptly dismantled its zero-COVID policy, according to government data. But some experts said that figure probably vastly undercounts the full impact, as it excludes those who die at home, and because many doctors have said they are discouraged from citing COVID-19 as a cause of death. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-development-workers-share-abduction-ordeal/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – The men who abducted development workers and labor rights advocates Dyan Gumanao and Armand Dayoha on January 10 in a crowded pier in Cebu City held them for days in handcuffs, blindfolds, and sometimes gags and ear muffs, while threatening to turn them over to other units of a “task force” for possible execution. Gumanao and Dayoha took turns detailing their ordeal in a press conference on Saturday, January 21, at the University of the Philippines-Cebu. “We were abducted. We did not elope. We did not go away to settle some issues,” Gumanao said in a mix of English and Cebuano. Their captors, who were placed in a quandary by a multi-sectoral campaign that quickly broke out with reports of their abduction, wanted them to accept and share the counter-claim that anonymous netizens posted as calls for their release snowballed. The narration of the two activists strengthened reports from academe sources about “friends of friends” in the national government who helped negotiate their release. Dayoha and Gumanao were on their way to Cebu City after visiting the latter’s family in Mindanao during the Christmas break. The couple had informed them of their plan to marry in May 2023. When their vessel docked, the couple decided to wait for the crowd to dissipate before disembarking. They were on the ramp, nearing ground level, when a voice behind them called their names. “Police kami (We’re police),” Dayoha recalled one of four men saying. Their abductors pushed them towards a silver vehicle waiting on the dockside – a place normally off limits to non-authorized transport. “We started to call for help, again and again,” said Dayoha. Passengers and other people in the area raised an outcry. “Tabang (help), I repeatedly cried while looking towards the security forces around us,” said Dayoha. “We could see them. They saw us. They heard people calling for help. We knew they were trained to respond to commotion. But nobody came to help,” the labor advocate and artist added. Gumanao also screamed for aid. “I said, ‘Aktibista kami’ (We are activists).” In full view of more than a dozen persons, including those wearing uniforms of pier security, their abductors held their legs and threw them into the sports utility vehicle. They were handcuffed, blindfolded, and gagged. They were brought to an undisclosed place where their abductors again introduced themselves again as police. In their first hours of captivity, the couple said, they just prayed that the scene at the pier would prod people to raise an alarm, alerting their families and friends. In an earlier interview with Rappler, Gumanao’s father, Danny, said he was certain that the couple had docked in Cebu because Dyan texted regularly about their movements – from the time they left their cousins in Davao, to traveling and boarding a vessel in Cagayan de Oro. After Gumanao’s repeated questions, one of the abductors said they were taken “because of what you said earlier. You are activists.” “They asked us about our ties to so-called terrorist groups and what we had done for them,” said Gumanao. She kept on demanding to see the warrants. There was apparently none. A day after, one of the abductors started explaining that they “had no other way” to get the couple to “cooperate.” “They said, ‘This is not an abduction, this is just an invitation’,” Gumanao recalled. Dayoha said that they spent most of the days handcuffed and blindfolded, even when they had to use the bathroom. “It was psychological and emotional torture,” he said. While Gumanao was angry at the “invitation” claim, she began to feel their abductors’ nervousness. “They kept urging me to respond to my father’s text messages,” she recalled. “But we were under duress and I did not want to play their game.” Dayoha said that one day, they were taken for a ride. They knew the vehicle had boarded a vessel. “We could smell the engine fumes, we could feel the rocking. And we heard a voice ask them for their ORCR (vehicle certificates of registration),” he recounted. “We knew they had taken us out of Cebu.” The abductors were worried. “Too many people know,” Dayoha recalled one of the abductors saying. But that did not keep the men from pressing both to confess to terrorist connections and actions, to giving up friends as terrorists. “They said they were from the task force and could pass us to other units, and we could find ourselves six feet below the ground,” said Gumanao. Even as they returned to Cebu, and were taken for another long drive until they reached a dark rural area on the night of January 15, the abductors kept on pressing them to change the narrative. They told the couple to go to the police station and clear the blotter filed by Dayoha’s mother, who had listed their case as an abduction. “They said to go to the next police station from where the blotter was filed. They asked us to say that we had just gone away for a break,” Gumanao said. After several hours, their abductors said they no longer had to go to the police. Instead, they were asked to check into a nearby resort, take a selfie to show they were unharmed, sleep over, and then leave the next morning. “Walking to the resort, we were torn between hope for freedom and fear that they would suddenly reappear to kill us,” said Gumanao. “Our knees were trembling, we could hardly walk,” said Dayoha. The couple checked in, ordered food as they had been deprived of meals for an entire day, but searched for their gadgets and immediately notified their families, asking to be rescued. “We did not dare leave the place,” said Gumanao. They spent the night sleeping in shifts, still worried about men barging into their rooms. The following day, early on January 16, as parents and friends and fellow advocates arrived to fetch them, Gumanao said she wanted to scream, partly in anger but largely in gratitude. “Of course, we could not immediately go public; we were still recovering. We were still shaken,” said Dayoha. In a fit of anger, the artist challenged police officials who questioned why they had not immediately showed up for the probe. “Our parents have been following this up. Even government agencies have been following this up. You all know that,” Dayoha said in Bisaya, without giving details of those who had worked for their release. “Those should be important parts of the probe. That was part of the help we got. People and agencies whose reports clearly showed something illegal had happened,” he said. People should not allow a change of narrative, Dayoha stressed. He was responding to statements attributed to Cebu City Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Maria Theresa Macatangay. Macatangay had challenged the two activists to “cooperate,” at one point chiding them for their silence and saying in Bisaya, “They are the ones who started all these.” “Here are the clear facts. We were abducted, and we were abducted because we are activists,” said Dayoha. “Because we are development workers, teachers, unionists. This is what we should ask. Just because we are activists, are we legitimate targets?” Addressing the Cebu City and provincial governments, Dayoha said: “This happened during the Sinulog. In public. In daylight.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-promise-new-investments-maharlika-fund-tips-switzerland-trip/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said on Saturday, January 21, that his “crucial participation” at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland yielded “beneficial outcomes” for the country in the form of potential investments, as well as solicited advice on the proposed Maharlika Investment Fund. “The trip has yielded beneficial outcomes relative to new trade and investment opportunities, and key partnerships forged to support our development program, a better appreciation for Filipino workers and professionals, and the promise of increased level of cooperation with various countries around the world,” the President said in his arrival statement. “The business meetings held promise new investments in many of our economic sectors including mining and processing, digital solutions, logistics, telecommunications, and renewable fuel, amongst others, and will enable our companies to participate deeper in global value chains,” he also said. Marcos said his team will work on building on their discussions with business executives in Davos. In an interview with Philippine media in Zurich on Friday, January 20, Marcos recognized that the process of securing investments is a long one and not always guaranteed. “This is a process. You don’t go one time and you come home and you know, everybody is going to invest $1 trillion already. Hindi ganoon (It’s not like that). We have to introduce them to the Philippines again. We have to ask them to come to the Philippines, send the team to make assessments on the business side et cetera. And then eventually kung magkaintindihan, magkakaroon ng bagong (if there’s a consensus, there will be a new) investment,” he told reporters. Marcos also reported in his arrival statement that he seized the chance to consult with experts in Davos on his administration’s proposed Maharlika Fund. “I took the opportunity as well to consult with our friends and partners in Davos on the sovereign wealth fund as a means for us to diversify our income sources, and to generate various welfare effects to the Filipino people, while recognizing that this is a collaborative work with experts and our lawmakers so that its final form is what we intend it to be,” he said. Ahead of the Davos trip, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Sorreta had said in a news briefing that Marcos himself had wanted a “soft launch” of the proposed Philippine sovereign wealth fund on the sidelines of the WEF. “The WEF is a great venue to do a sort of soft launch for our sovereign wealth fund, given the prominence of the forum itself and the global and business leaders who will be there, and they will hear directly from the President the fundamentals that we have that led us to decide that we should have a sovereign wealth fund,” Sorreta had said. On Saturday, Marcos described the discussion on the proposed fund in Davos as “interactive.” “Not only did we present our ideas on what the fund should look like but we asked them, what do you think would be most advantageous for the Philippines so as to allow the potential investments that you are thinking about bringing into the Philippines, and how the fund would be best designed to service that investment,” he said. During the media interview on Friday, Marcos also responded to criticism about his “bloated” official delegation to the WEF in Davos. “Well, the delegation was large. But half of it was private. They came here on their own. They stayed in their own places. They made their own arrangements. Although they are technically part of the delegation. So the delegation essentially just consists of the Cabinet secretaries, myself, the Speaker, and of course the staff that support them,” he said. The President also said that it did not matter how many passengers boarded Philippine Airlines flight PR001 – a chartered flight – because the government will still pay the same amount. “In regards of the plane, kahit naman ilan ang isakay mo ‘yan, pareho lang ibabayad mo. So doesn’t make any difference kung how many people came on (In regards of the plane, no matter how many rode it, you will still pay for the same amount. So it doesn’t make any difference how many people came on).” Marcos also said that he wants his team to be “complete” for such events, especially his Cabinet secretaries in case there are questions related to their respective agencies. “We try to be complete. When is the next chance we will get to speak to CEOs of Top Fortune 100 companies, in a period of two days?” he said. “So whoever we get to talk to, kailangang nandoon ang secretary na puwede niyang sagutin, puwede niyang kausapin. May tao doong nakakaalam tungkol sa mga bagay na kailangan gawin. So that if there is something that needs to be done, they can do it immediately,” the President added. (So whoever we get to talk to, the secretary is there to answer questions. There would people there who would know what needs to be done.) Asked why his cousin, House Speaker Romualdez, and Senator Mark Villar were part of the delegation, Marcos said they were there to make sure that there are legislators who could ease potential investors’ concerns about some Philippine laws. “Let’s say you talk to a potential investor, sasabihin niya ‘yong batas ninyo hindi maganda eh, kami naiipit (they would say the law is not good, we’re put in a tight squeeze). So at least we have the legislators here who can say, ‘Well, we can do something about it or no, that is important to us that we maintain it,'” Marcos said. From January 15 to 20, the jet-setter president embarked on his eighth foreign trip as chief executive and flew to Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). In the forum, he was supposed to present his economic plans for the country. But for JC Punongbayan, economist and Rappler columnist, Marcos, the lone leader from Southeast Asia in the forum, had nothing to show for at the WEF. Critics also called out the Marcos government for spending money for the trip despite the rising prices of basic commodities in the Philippines. The President’s official delegation included his nuclear family – First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos, and their son, Ilocos Norte congressman Sandro Marcos. Speaker Romualdez’s wife, Tingog Representative Yedda Marie Romualdez, also joined the trip. Actress Dawn Zulueta, wife of Special Assistant to the President Secretary Anton Lagdameo, was spotted during the trip. Zulueta is not a government official. Meanwhile, Paul Soriano, Marcos’ godson and presidential adviser on creative communications, was also spotted in Davos.

The Australian No. 2 soaked up the cheers of a raucous Rod Laver Arena crowd on Saturday, January 21, as he booked his place in the last 16 for the second year in a row with an emphatic 7-6 (0), 6-2, 6-1 win over Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi. Gritty and hard-running, but not blessed with killer weapons, the 23-year-old could not be more different than flashy Netflix star Kyrgios, who is renowned for his temper as much as his tennis. But De Minaur has filled the breach superbly at a tournament where Australians are now in short supply. “I’m very happy, I can’t lie,” De Minaur told the center court crowd. “Honestly, as a kid this is what you train for – to be playing on this court in front of you guys.” “Every time I get out here I’ve got to pinch myself.” Kyrgios is renowned for pumping up the fans – and then berating them when they get unruly – but De Minaur’s tennis was all he needed to send the crowd wild. Inflatable kangaroos bobbed in the Rod Laver Arena terraces and Mexican waves surged around the stadium in the third set as De Minaur put the foot down against Bonzi. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but to see a packed Rod Laver Arena was pretty special,” he said. “There’s no secret that I love playing here in my back yard. I think the Aussie crowd is amazing.” “The difference is that the opponents not only have to play against me, they have to play against the whole crowd.” De Minaur will next face the winner of nine-time champion Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov, who play in the evening session. Countryman and fellow 23-year-old Alexei Popyrin, who stunned eighth seed Taylor Fritz in the second round, will try to join De Minaur in the last 16 when he plays American Ben Shelton. “I hope everyone that’s on this court is going to go and support Alexei Popyrin,” De Minaur said in a rallying cry to the Laver crowd. “That’s what we do, we Aussies, we stick together … Let’s get Pop over the line today.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/brazilian-coupist-posts-reported-remain-online-networks/,[],"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Ten days were not enough for the main social networks to mobilize to find and remove from their depths posts that violate their own guidelines, and that were used to encourage the coupist attacks in Brazil on January 8th. Since the invasion of the National Congress, the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF), and the Planalto Palace, the Lupa nos Golpistas database has received at least 2,173 non-repeated links that lead to six social networks: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Kwai. These URLs were forwarded for having material that served to organize and disseminate the terrorist acts, or that encouraged vandalism. On Wednesday, January 18, at the request of Lupa, an exclusive survey done by Lagom Data shows that at least 1,651 – namely 76% – of these URLs remain active and could be accessed by any user. Instagram, a social network managed by Meta, was the platform that was most reported to Lupa. Out of the 1,124 non-repeated links targeted as coupist, 683 remained online. One of these is a video, posted on the day of the acts, showing a man inside of a car defending the installation of “chaos in Brazil” so that the Army could intervene “to impose the Guarantee of Law and Order.” The recording accumulated more than 12 thousand likes until Wednesday afternoon. A second video on Instagram, also filmed on the day of the failed coup attempt, shows a crowd walking towards The Square of the Three Powers, carrying signs that called for “military intervention” and shouting “Supreme is the people.” In a third one, the destruction of the plenary of the Supreme Court from the inside is observed, followed by the phrase “The people has just entered the STF, where are the ‘iluministers’ and the egghead?” in a critical reference to the members of the Court. The continuity of these links on air contradicts the guidelines published by Instagram itself – the platform informs that they are not “a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups” and establishes that “serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren’t allowed.” In the network’s own words, this includes “specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm.” Regarding the coupist acts, there was also damage to public goods, as a preliminary report by The Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage (Iphan) shows. On Facebook, equally managed by Meta, the lack of moderation is also identified. The platform has clear policies for its users and, in them, it dedicates a large portion to violence and crime instigation. Among the listed consequences are the removal of content, the disabling of accounts, and the collaboration with law enforcement authorities when “a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety” is noticed. With a total of 539 coupist links reported to Lupa, the social network had removed or restricted access to only three of them – 536 remained active on Wednesday. On Facebook posts showing, for example, images of a dominated Brasília were still available. In one of the antidemocratic contents, a woman wrote in English that “millions of Brazilians are marching now to take back the government” and added, “they will camp inside Congress as the aim to eradicate the illegitimate government.” There is no proof that the elections of 2022 were rigged, or that the source code of the electronic ballots might have been corrupted in favor of specific candidates — those are,  moreover, only some of the conspiratory theories shared by the bolsonarists after the victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in October. Another example of content published on Facebook reported to Lupa nos Golpistas is a video where a man, dressed in green and yellow, shouts repeatedly: “We’ve invaded.” Besides saying that the police “is on our side,” he also called other people to join the acts: “Come over here, we need you.” Twitter had 370 nonrepeated URLs reported to the collaborative database on Lupa. 10 days later only three of them were no longer available. At least 75 reports came from TikTok, and until Wednesday afternoon, at least five links remained active. On Kwai, however, all of the 14 links reported were still accessible on Wednesday. On YouTube, 46 of the 51 links remained active. On Twitter, for example, one of the contents still available was a two-minute video posted on January 7. The recording shows a map with lengths to the federal capital and “invites” the coupists to the already denounced “Festa da Selma” (Selma’s Party). On Kwai, people show up calling caravans from Rondônia to Brasilia, giving clear instructions on how to get to the Esplanade of the Ministries and informing the users about other groups that would leave other states. In another video, a man shows the mobilization of the Military Forces and celebrates: “Let it be the beginning of the end of communism.” Kwai says in its election policy that it defends the freedom of speech, but it doesn’t tolerate “content that has the potential to harm the democratic process.” Finally, on TikTok, videos showing message exchanges where a person salutes another with the expression, “What’s up, terrorist?” remain active. After the exchange, the person is informed that there is a supposed pact between the coupists and the security forces of the Federal District so that they do not intervene in the action of January 8. TikTok’s public guidelines say that the platform does not authorize its use “to threaten or incite violence or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts.” They also reinforce that, “when there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence,” the content must be removed or the account will be banned. The platform adds that if “motivated” they will report the threats to the relevant legal authorities. On YouTube however, where only 10% of the links reported to Lupa nos Golpistas were removed, it is possible to find content such as a live transmission broadcasted on the day of the acts titled “War in Brasilia.” The publication amassed more than 83 thousand views until Wednesday afternoon. Lupa sought the platforms mentioned in this news piece, asking them to comment on the surveyed data and explain why they take so long to remove the antidemocratic contents. Until the publication of this news piece, only Facebook, Instagram, and Kwai had replied. Kwai’s press office indicated in a note that its initiatives to contain the advance and the spread of content that have the potential to harm the democratic process “remain active.” It also detailed other measures to avoid the spread of the contents, such as reporting mechanisms. Meta – responsible for Instagram and Facebook – informed in a note that identified Brazil as a “place of temporary high risk” before the elections and that resorted to “remove content that encouraged people to take on arms or to invade public buildings such as the Congress or the Planalto Palace.“ The enterprise also informed to be collaborating with the authorities and that will continue to remove content that violates their policies. They admitted, however, that in face of the “scale” of their services, “prohibiting determined content does not mean zero occurrences.” – Rappler.com As a result of the attacks in Brasília, Lupa requests the collaboration of its followers to build a database that gathers antidemocratic posts published on social networks and messaging apps.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/china-coast-guard-shooed-away-filipino-fishing-boat-ayungin-shoal/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Saturday, January 21, that it is investigating an incident involving a Chinese coast guard vessel (CCGV) that allegedly shooed away a Filipino fishing boat in Ayungin Shoal earlier in January. On Friday, January 20, Filipino fishing boat (FFB) Ken-Ken boat captain Lito Al-os reported to the PCG that CCGV 5204 allegedly drove them away while they were fishing in vicinity waters off Ayungin Shoal on January 9. In the report, CCGV 5204 was said to have maneuvered towards the fishing boat around 800 yards away, and deployed a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB). The China Coast Guard personnel onbaord the RHIB gestured for the Filipino fishermen to leave the area. This prompted FFB Ken-Ken to alter its course and depart Ayungin Shoal. But, according to the PCG, CCGV 5204 continued to shadow FFB Ken-Ken towards Boxall Reef. Upon receiving the report, PCG Task Force Pag-asa “immediately” deployed additional Coast Guard vessels to strengthen presence in the West Philippine Sea. “This is to protect the interest and ensure the safety of Filipino fishermen who conduct fishing operations in the said vicinity waters as their source of livelihood,” the PCG said. As of Saturday afternoon, the PCG said it is collecting evidence and more information that will be forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). “If deemed necessary, the DFA may use the said report in filing an appropriate diplomatic action,” the PCG said. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Artemio Abu assured the concerned Filipino fishermen that the PCG “remains steadfast in its commitment to uphold rules-based approaches in protecting their welfare and securing the country’s exclusive economic zones at all costs.” Reports of the China Coast Guard harassing Filipino fishermen – and even Philippine government vessels – in the West Philippine Sea are not new. In November 2021, three Chinese coast guard vessels were documented blocking and using water cannons on Philippine boats en route to Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, drawing international outrage. The Philippine ships are resupply boats that transport food supplies to military personnel assigned in the maritime feature, which belongs to the Philippines. This has been happening years after the Philippines won the arbitration case it lodged against China in 2016, striking down China’s nine-dash line claim to the West Philippine Sea. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has vowed to uphold the country’s landmark arbitral award. His predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who maintained close ties with China, spoke erratically about the Hague ruling, swinging from vowing to protect the Hague ruling and Filipino fishermen, to likening the award to mere paper he would throw in the trash. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/journalist-lensman-owen-bayog-dies/,[],"Journalist and photographer Owen Segovia Bayog died on Friday, January 20, in Bacolod City, after a lingering illness. He was 46. Bayog’s initial foray into journalism was with the regional Visayas Daily Examiner. He later worked as staff photographer for the Negros Daily Bulletin, and also contributed to the multi-awarded alternative online news outlet Bulatlat. He was the brains behind the Negros Sentinel, a local news website. The Negros Press Club, the country’s oldest press club, elected him as a director in 2018. Prior to his confinement in July 2022, he worked as a commentator for Negros MUEWS Radio 104.7 FM, gracing the airwaves on weeknights. In between taking photos and actively participating in community journalism, Bayog also lent his skill as photographer for then-Bacolod mayor Evelio Leonardia and congressman Greg Gasataya, and as festival photographer for the municipality of Don Salvador Benedicto. Through his OSB Digital Photography, Bayog became known as an instructor in photography training workshops, and as a sought-after photographer for weddings, portraits and events. Bayog discovered journalism and photojournalism while still a student in the early 1990s. While studying at La Consolacion College-Bacolod, he joined the student publication The Ripples. The College Editors Guild of the Philippines elected him vice president for Visayas, during the CEGP presidency of Ruth Cervantes. Cervantes fondly remembers Bayog: “When I met Owen in the late 90s, my impression of him was he looked like your typical “maton” from the movies. Looks could really be deceiving, though, for he was never a bully.” “Owen was funny, smart, witty, and empathetic,” Cervantes said. “We would work together for two years. He and his family opened up their home to me when I was touring Negros and meeting up with editors from various schools. Momsie, Popsie, Owen and their furbaby Kevin made me feel welcome,” she added. “When I first met him, Owen was this massive dark boulder of a man with almost a grouch for a face. But it is just that – a first impression melted by his kind demeanor, humor, and a strong heart for press freedom, protection of rights, and justice,” said former CEGP president Rey Asis. Bayog is survived by longtime partner Maria Liza Yorac and their children. Bayog’s remains will lie in state at the Rolling Hills Memorial Chapels in Bacolod. Donations are accepted to cover the expenses for Bayog’s long hospital and home confinement since July, and for his burial. Funeral details will be announced shortly, said Yorac. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/barmm-aims-bimp-eaga-economic-player/,[],"COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Four years after its creation, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is embarking on a difficult task to turn itself into a major economic player in the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines-East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), after registering a positive economic performance despite the COVID-19 pandemic. “We position the Bangsamoro region as a major economic player in BIMP-EAGA,” said BARMM interim Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim during the first-ever Bangsamoro Business Congress (BBC) on January 17 to 19, ahead of the celebration of the 4th anniversary of the special Mindanao region on Saturday, January 21. The four-year-old administrative region was created as a result of the signing of the 2018 Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) that established the BARMM as a new autonomous political entity, replacing the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The business congress, which was attended by some 300 chambers of commerce and industry representatives, local entrepreneurs and businessmen, international development partners, and representatives of foreign investors among others, set the direction for business and tourism in the region as it looks to establish itself on the country’s investments and tourism map. The Bangsamoro region, however, still has a long way to go as it faces challenges such as providing adequate power supply and water sources, improved road infrastructure, and efficient internet connectivity for local and foreign investors. BARMM Ministry of Trade, Investment and Tourism Director-General Rosslaini Alonto-Sinarimbo said the regional government has improved business registration processes and provided incentives to attract investments, but emphasized that “we need to establish business and keep business alive with reliable power supply, good infrastructure, reliable internet connectivity, road networks, and stable peace and order.” BBC chairman Ronald Torres said the region’s stability is a key factor in attracting more investments. “Peace and development are now prevailing in the region. Everybody believes that once we have a stable peace and order condition, we can attract more investors who will provide job opportunities for the people of Bangsamoro,” he said. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Deputy Mission Director Rebekah Eubanks said the BARMM’s positive economic performance of 7.5% in 2021 provided a good foundation for the regional government and the region’s business sector to build and sustain the momentum for growth. “This will definitely boost the private sector’s confidence to invest and establish businesses in the region. We are all here today because we believe in a powerful force of positive change in the BARMM and in Mindanao,” Eubank said. The BBC, held at Cotabato State University, adopted a dozen resolutions, reiterating their support for the Mindanao peace process. The other resolutions called for the fast-tracking of economic packages for former combatants of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and speeding up of the recovery and rehabilitation efforts in Marawi City devastated by the five-month fighting between government and a radical group’s forces in 2017. The region’s business leaders appealed for more support for financing small and medium enterprises, full implementation of national government programs in Mindanao, the upgrading of seaports and airports, reliable internet connection, and more private sector involvement in BARMM’s economic development. The business leaders also sought stronger Customs and immigration security protocols in the BARMM. Sinarimbo said these can be integrated into the draft investment code prior to its approval by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority parliament. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/bangko-sentral-pilipinas-increases-interest-rate-cap-credit-card-transactions-january-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has increased the interest rate cap on credit card transactions from 2% to 3% per month, or 100 basis points. “The policy aligns the credit card interest rate ceiling with developments in the macroeconomy and cushions the impact of inflationary pressure on banks’/credit card issuers’ ability to provide quality credit card services to their clients,” BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said in a statement on Friday, January 20. Meanwhile, the existing ceiling on the monthly add-on rate that credit card issuers can charge on installment loans stays at a maximum rate of 1%. The maximum processing fee on availing credit card cash advances remains at P200 per transaction. The caps on credit card transactions were a “temporary relief measure” to ease consumers’ burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to allow affordable access to credit. The BSP said in fixing the caps, it considered the prevailing low interest rate environment during the pandemic. In increasing the interest rate ceiling, the BSP factored in the upward trend in domestic interest rates due to high inflation, and the BSP’s efforts to counter them through successive policy rate hikes. The BSP sees the adjusted interest rate helping banks and credit card issuers cover higher costs related to the efficient handling of consumer transactions, which include timely dispute resolution and the retention of competent personnel. “It will also make funding available for long-term investments that will institutionalize process improvements, strengthen cybersecurity and Information Technology systems, and nurture innovation in these financial institutions that will lead to better customer experience,” the BSP said in a statement. The BSP maintained that the decision to adjust interest rates is in line with its mandate to determine the reasonableness of credit card fees, and its goal to keep credit card pricing affordable. “The BSP will continue to implement complementary measures that will give consumers access to financial products at lower cost such as the provision of an enabling framework that will foster a level playing field for new market entrants, promote prudent digital innovation, enable responsible access to credit information, and uphold rights of financial consumers,” said Medalla. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-prime-minister-chris-hipkins-profile/,[],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand – Chris Hipkins, set to become New Zealand’s prime minister, built a reputation for competence in tackling COVID-19, though he acknowledges some mistakes in handling the pandemic and faces a tough battle to retain power in an October general election. Known as “Chippy,” the former COVID minister is a close ally of Jacinda Ardern, who shocked the nation on Thursday, January 19, by announcing she was resigning. Hipkins, 44, expected to succeed Ardern as Labour leader on Sunday, January 22, after no other candidates emerged, faces a stern test upon taking power, with Labour trailing the opposition in opinion polls and the country expected to fall into recession next quarter before a general election on October 14. Often brought in by Ardern when other cabinet colleagues were struggling with their portfolios, Hipkins pledged on Saturday, January 21, to continue her governing style while putting his own stamp on running the country. “Jacinda provided calm, stable, reassuring leadership, which I hope to continue to do. We are different people though, and I’m sure that people will see that,” Hipkins told a news conference on Saturday after emerging as the only candidate to lead the ruling Labour Party. First elected to parliament in 2008, Hipkins became a household name fronting the government’s response to the pandemic. He was appointed health minister in July 2020 before becoming the COVID response minister at the end of the year. Under Ardern’s “go hard, go early” approach to COVID, the island nation of 5 million was among the first to close borders. The policy was hailed around the world for keeping New Zealanders virus-free through the first half of 2021, but the public tired of the zero-tolerance strategy, which included a nationwide lockdown over a single infection. Criticism over the strict lockdowns grew as officials struggled to control a Delta outbreak from August 2021. Hipkins later said quarantine measures should have been scaled back earlier. “I’ve dealt with some challenging situations over the last five and a half years, the last couple of years particularly,” Hipkins said on Saturday. “And, you know, I’m a human being. I’ll make the odd mistake from time to time. I try and own the mistakes that I make.” He would not be drawn on his policy plans. A 1News-Kantar poll released in December had Labour’s support falling to 33% from 40% at the start of 2022. At that rate, Labour could not form a majority even with traditional coalition partner the Green Party at 9%. The opposition National Party has benefited from Labour’s decline. Hipkins is known around parliament for his sense of humour – including an ability to laugh at himself. Meaning to tell COVID-cramped New Zealanders once that they should socially distance when they go out to stretch their legs, he mistakenly said “spread your legs.” After the faux pas went viral, he was seen drinking from a mug with the notorious phrase on it. Hipkins, who grew up in the Hutt Valley north of the capital Wellington, said his “parents came from relatively humble beginnings and worked really hard to provide a good life” for him and his brother. “My commitment and politics is to make sure that we provide opportunities for all Kiwis who want to work hard, to be able to work hard and get ahead and provide a better life for themselves and for their families.” Hipkins became minister for police in mid-2022 amid a crime wave. He is also minister for education and public service, as well as leader of the House. Before joining parliament, he was senior adviser to two education ministers and served in the office of former Prime Minister Helen Clark. An outdoor enthusiast and keen cyclist, Hipkins is known to commute to the capital Wellington by bicycle from his home in an adjoining city. – Rappler.com"

The job cuts affect 6% of its workforce, and follows thousands of layoffs at tech giants including Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Meta Platforms Inc who are downsizing after a pandemic-led hiring spree left them flabby in a weak economy. Shares in Mountain View, California-based Alphabet, which boosted its workforce by nearly a third through 2020 and 2021, rose 4% on Friday. They had fallen 30% in the past 12 months, echoing a 24% slump in the broader tech industry .IXIC. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s boss since 2019, said in the memo on Friday that he took “full responsibility” for the decisions that led to the layoffs. Pichai, whose pay was recently tied more closely to performance, said this was a moment to “sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” as Alphabet looked to get imbue its products with more AI, echoing comments from Microsoft that announced job cuts on Wednesday. Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft, which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT – a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses. Advertising dollars, Alphabet’s mainstay revenue source, meanwhile, is feeling the squeeze from businesses chopping budgets as consumers pull back spending. “It is clear that Alphabet is not immune from the tough economic backdrop, with worries about a U.S. recession growing,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Ad growth has come off the boil … Competition is also heating up, with Alphabet facing a powerful rival in TikTok, and Instagram also vying for its important YouTube viewers,” Streeter said, noting that Alphabet has also racked up billions in regulatory fines. Evercore ISIS analyst Mark Mahaney said Alphabet’s record-high headcount had created major margin risk going into fiscal 2023 and Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said the job cuts could save the company Alphabet $2.5 billion to $3 billion in costs. With Alphabet’s staff cuts, layoffs at four of the biggest US tech companies total 51,000 jobs in the past few months. They have fanned fears of a recession even as the US job market remains tight. “The tech sector is bit like the proverbial canary in the coal mine,” said Stuart Cole, an economist at Equiti Capital, who believes the tech layoffs portend that the outlook for job security is finally beginning to turn more negative. Apple, which hired more prudently through the pandemic, has held off on cuts so far. On Friday, though, website AppleInsider reported citing sources that the iPhone maker had started to lay off non-seasonal employees in its retail channel in places such as Best Buy stores. Apple was not immediately available for a comment on the report. Alphabet has been working on a major AI launch, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. One of the sources said it would take place in the spring. The New York Times also reported that Google planned to unveil more than 20 new products and a search engine including chatbot features. Among those losing their jobs are recruiters, corporate staff and people working on engineering and product teams, Pichai said. Google has cut most jobs at Area 120, its in-house incubator for new projects, a company spokesperson told Reuters. The Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement that the company’s leadership taking “full responsibility” was “little comfort.” “It’s appalling that our jobs are first on the chopping block so shareholders can see a few more points in a chart next quarter,” the union said. In the United States, where Alphabet has already emailed affected employees, staff would receive severance and six months of healthcare as well as immigration support. Overseas, layoff notifications will take longer due to local employment laws and practices, Pichai said in the memo. Employees in Asia will learn starting in February if the reduction impacts them. – Rappler.com"

The local government issued a public advisory prohibiting people from going to the Asik-Asik Falls in Purok 9 Barangay Carmen in Baguio District. Alfredo Baloran, the head of the city’s disaster risk reduction and management office, said Asik-Asik Falls has been classified as highly susceptible to landslides based on assessments conducted by the local government and environment department. The risk was also pointed out in the Detailed Flood and Landslide Susceptibility Map of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Mines and Geosciences Bureau (DENR-MGB). “With this, tourists visiting the area are at risk of natural hazards such as rock falls, landslides, and flooding, especially during heavy rainfall,” Baloran told the local government-run Davao City Disaster Radio. Local officials said the prevailing rainy weather, which is expected to continue until March, would cause further erosion in ravines and foothills in the area, making landslides even more probable. They cited an incident in 2022 when nine people were trapped in the vicinity of Asik-Asik Falls after the water level at the Talomo River suddenly surged to a highly dangerous level. “Those who like to take photos and swim, please avoid Asik-Asik Falls for now because the place is dangerous,” Baloran said. Many parts of Mindanao saw weeks of inclement weather since late December 2022. A shear line and later, a lingering low-pressure area caused widespread flooding and landslides that damaged and destroyed vital infrastructure. One was a section of the Talaingod-Valencia Bukidnon road which was destroyed after a landslide on January 14. The road serves as a vital link between the Davao Region and Northern Mindanao. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in the Davao Region said only one lane of the road section was passable to light vehicles. “Public utility vans, cargo trucks, buses, and multi-axle trucks are advised to take the Davao-Bukidnon Road while clearing operations are ongoing. Motorists are advised to take necessary precautions while traveling due to the prevailing weather conditions. We apologize for the inconvenience,” read part of a DPWH-Davao public notice. – Rappler.com"

Reyes was implicated in the pork barrel scam and has been in jail since 2014. In explaining why Reyes was granted the extraordinary writ, the SC said it was because her constitutional right to speedy trial was infringed upon, and her detention had “become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.” Traditionally, this extraordinary writ is used to challenge the detention of a person, lobby for their release, and “to inquire into the cause of detention of a person.” Legal experts, including former SC spokesperson Ted Te said that because of the ruling, a new legal remedy for temporary release has become available.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/supreme-court-ruling-illegally-dismissed-lazada-riders/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) has ruled in favor of five riders who alleged that their employer Lazada illegally dismissed them in 2017. In a decision promulgated on September 21, 2022, but released to the media on Friday, January 20, the SC challenged the rulings of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and the Court of Appeals, which found that there was no employer-employee relationship between the petitioners and Lazada E-Services Philippines, Incorporated. The SC ordered Lazada to reinstate the petitioners – Chrisden Ditiangkin, Hendrix Molines, Harvey Juanio, Joselito Verde, and Brian Anthony Nabong – to their former positions as Lazada riders. They will receive full backwages computed from the time of dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement. The case was brought to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of the total monetary benefits that the petitioners were entitled to. In February 2016, the petitioners were hired by Lazada with the primary task of transporting items from sellers and to Lazada’s warehouse. They earned P1,200 each per day for one year, as stipulated in their contracts. Sometime in January 2017, a dispatcher told the riders that they were removed from their usual routes, and will no longer be given schedules. The riders still reported to work for three more days, waited all day for new assignments, but were not given any. They learned that their routes were already given to other employees. This prompted the riders to file an illegal dismissal complaint against Lazada with the NLRC. They claimed that they were regular employees of Lazada, as the means and methods by which they carry out their work is subject to the discretion and control of Lazada. Lazada, meanwhile, maintained that the riders were not their regular employees, but independent contractors. The company argued that when a buyer purchases an item through Lazada, the company merely coordinates the delivery of the product through an independent transportation service. This made delivery merely an ancillary activity, and not its main line of business. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the riders’ complaint, ruling that they were not regular employees of Lazada. The NLRC and the Court of Appeals upheld this. The riders elevated the case to the SC, which found that Lazada failed to discharge its burden of proving that the riders were independent contractors rather than regular employees. “When the status of the employment is in dispute, the employer bears the burden to prove that the person whose service it pays for is an independent contractor rather than a regular employee with or without fixed terms,” read the decision penned by Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen. The SC used a two-tiered test to determine whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Lazada and the petitioners: the four-fold test, and the economic-dependence test. The High Court found that all four factors in the first test were present: The SC ruled that the riders were directly employed by Lazada because they signed contracts with the company. They also received their salaries from Lazada, and the company had the power to terminate them. Lazada also directed their work through requiring the accomplishment of a route sheet which kept track of the arrival, departure, and unloading time of the items. The riders were also required to submit trip tickets and incident reports to Lazada. Since delivery of items is integrated in the services offered by Lazada, the SC also held that the services performed by the petitioners were integral to Lazada’s business. The case also passed the economic-dependence test, as the riders were hired by Lazada directly after being previously engaged by a third-party contractor to provide services for Lazada. This means that the petitioners were economically dependent on Lazada for their livelihood. “Protection of the law afforded to labor precedes over the nomenclature and stipulations of the contract…. Thus, it is patently erroneous for the labor tribunals to reject an employer-employee relationship simply because the Contract stipulates that this relationship does not exist,” the SC decision read. Labor rights group Partido Manggagawa hailed the decision. “Magandang desisyon ng Korte para sa ating mga delivery riders (This is a good decision by the Court for our delivery riders),” it said on its Facebook page. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/40261-boss-enrile-gigi-reyes/,['CHAY F. HOFILEÑA'],"This story was first published on October 1, 2013. We are republishing it due to renewed public interest after the Supreme Court ordered on January 19, 2023, the release of Gigi Reyes from detention after nine years. *** MANILA, Philippines – It’s perhaps the unlikeliest of relationships. She was a student activist in her college days at the University of the Philippines (UP), while he was the defense minister who implemented Martial Law under the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. His marriage of 55 years has borne two adult children linked to past controversies, while her marriage, known to have ended, has produced 3 kids, none of whom have been publicly controversial. She is 30 years younger than the man she calls “The Boss,” an intelligent and astute politician who has survived many political upheavals, including rebellion charges against him. Abrasive and cutting as he wishes, most especially to political enemies, former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile or JPE has a “special fondness” for his former chief of staff Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes, say those who have been in the Senate for decades. On past occasions, they add, they have seen Enrile give Reyes a hug and a buss on the forehead. He values her loyalty, for sure, as well as her professional competence. Gigi Reyes was regarded as “the door, if not the bridge, to JPE.” But at least twice, JPE tried to dispel notions that there was anything more than a professional relationship between them. In January 2013, during an interview on television, he said, “If they’re implying that she’s my girlfriend, well, I’m too old for that, my God!” That was in reaction to insinuations made in a privilege speech by fellow senator Alan Peter Cayetano about a relationship between Enrile and his then-chief of staff. Cayetano’s speech was in retaliation for Reyes’ accusations of hypocrisy against him for supposedly receiving a “cash gift” from the Office of the Senate President. The ugly incident ended with an apology and the irrevocable resignation of Reyes from Enrile’s office. Before that, the first public denial came way back in 1998 when the Chicago Tribune reported that Enrile’s wife Cristina left him after she could no longer tolerate his “alleged tryst with a top aide.” In a statement, Enrile said in 1998: “What is totally false and malicious are the reports in the press and the rumor mills that the cause of our marital difficulties is an alleged relationship between me and my Chief of Staff, lawyer Gigi Reyes. There is no relationship, other than an official and professional one.” The issue would not have mattered, nor would it have been of public interest, were it not for plunder charges involving the alleged misuse by lawmakers – including Enrile – of billions of pesos from their Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF). Reyes was among the respondents named in the complaint filed by the justice department with the Office of the Ombudsman on September 16. She is accused of signing documents that facilitated the release of Enrile’s PDAF to fake non-governmental organizations (NGOs) linked to Janet Lim Napoles, the woman said to be behind the intricate web of corruption and deception involving pork barrel funds. In an affidavit submitted by Merlina Suñas, among the witnesses in the PDAF scam, Reyes is mentioned as being among the recipients of commissions given by Napoles to legislators and their staff. “Ang porsiyento naman ni Atty. Gigi Reyes ay ’pinapadala ni Madame Jenny kay Fernando Ramirez o kay John Raymund de Asis sa bahay ni Atty. Reyes mismo,” Suñas said. (The commission of Atty. Gigi Reyes is given by Madame Jenny [Napoles] to Fernando Ramirez or John Raymund de Asis to be delivered to the house of Atty. Reyes herself.) When Enrile’s lawyer Enrique dela Cruz defended his client, saying the former Senate president “never authorized anyone to enter into an illegal transaction. If they did, it’s outside their authority and they should be held responsible,” many took notice. It signalled that Reyes was going to be left hung to dry. Obviously hurt by Dela Cruz’s pronouncement, interpreted as having been made with the blessings of Enrile, Reyes spoke about “travesty and betrayal” in a September 21 post on her Facebook page. In all capital letters, she wrote, “The worst blow has just been dealt upon me by no less than the camp of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, the man I served with full dedication, honesty and loyalty for 25 years.” The following day, emerging from a four-day hospitalization, Enrile made an appearance in the Senate and said: “I am not out to betray any of my people. I’ve never been known for that.” It was as if “The Boss” and his loyal staff were communicating with each other through the media. Described as “charming with a high EQ (emotional quotient),” Reyes graduated from the UP College of Law in 1987. Regarded as “one of the boys” back then, she became vice chair of the UP Arts and Sciences Student Council. Among her contemporaries in the early 1980s was student activist Lean Alejandro, who was vice chair of the UP Student Council. Alejandro would later be ambushed and killed. The ’80s was marked by student unrest fueled by the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 and the earlier sham presidential elections of 1981. Student leaders influenced by polarized ideologies of national democracy (NatDem) and social democracy (SocDem) organized rallies that condemned the Marcos dictatorship and the pseudo lifting of Martial Law. The political winds of change would blow up with the 1986 People Power uprising, which Enrile and then Armed Forces Chief of Staff Fidel V. Ramos supported. As a student leader, Reyes was not a firebrand. “Articulate, sharp, and very intelligent,” the NatDem-influenced Reyes was “acceptable even to the non-Left,” her contemporaries said. Aligned with the student group SAMASA, they engaged in nasty polemical exchanges with their rival Tugon, which was associated with the SocDems. After law school, Reyes joined the Pecabar law firm of Ponce Enrile, Cayetano, Reyes, Manalastas. It was 1988 and it was there where she met Enrile. By the early 1990s, she was brought to the Senate to work as technical/legal staff before eventually being appointed chief of staff in the mid-1990s, Senate staffers recalled. Very close to her father Pat Gonzales, editor in chief of the Martial Law-era Bulletin Today, Reyes probably saw in Enrile her own father, said a former Senate staff. She worshipped Enrile the same way she worshipped her father, who died of a heart attack. As Enrile himself would tell the Inquirer in January, “I call her up every day, even in the wee hours if I suddenly think of something I need to have ready the following day. She takes care of everything for me. I have no time for details.” As the Senate staffer said, “Gigi devoted her life to him.” Before her September outburst on Facebook, Reyes wrote on the occasion of Fathers’ Day last June: “JUAN PONCE ENRILE…public servant, politician, friend, boss…but first and foremost…A LOVING FATHER. When he takes you under his wings, he will love and protect you at all cost…with self-abandon and self-sacrifice. Jack and Katrina, thank you for sharing your father’s love to us all who love him so dearly and are grateful for the profound and essential kindness of this great man. HAPPY FATHERS DAY TO THE BEST BOSS ANYONE CAN HAVE!” Much earlier, Gigi’s ex-husband, lawyer Rodolfo “Inky” Reyes, tried to mask trouble in their marriage, even going to such extent as faxing a statement to reporters to say, “I am positively sure that he (Enrile) wouldn’t do anything to hurt us or our marriage.” More than a decade later, however, he openly declares that he is now married to Aimee Vesagas-Reyes and has three sons. He is also active in the Victory Christian Fellowship, where he leads bible discussion groups. Gigi Reyes would have been a politician’s ideal wife. She was popular in the Senate and did not push her weight around. Her only weakness perhaps was expensive jewelry and designer bags. She was open to issues being brought up to her principal to push or advocate for, and was willing to help law school batchmates and even people she did not know very well. Her own law school batch donated a room in the UP Law School building named after Enrile, who was chosen guest speaker in their November 2012 law alumni homecoming. It was Reyes’ silver jubilarian batch that hosted the event. The choice of Enrile was a controversial and hotly debated one, given his role in the Marcos administration. But those who opposed it eventually acquiesced. After all, Enrile had steered the Senate past rough waters in the impeachment of former Supreme Court Justice Renato Corona. Perhaps because of her proximity to power, Gigi Reyes was both feared and respected. She attended Senate caucuses and had easy access to JPE, even joining him during Estrada’s last night in Malacañang at the height of the EDSA Dos uprising in 2001. Many approached her because they knew she was influential. Her 50th birthday bash was attended by senators, politicians, and even President Benigno Aquino III. When JPE launched his book recently, she was there. When Enrile’s son Jack made a bid for the Senate, she and her brother Patrick were very much involved in his campaign. In a mock Senate poll held in May 2013, Jack placed No. 2, reaping the benefits of his father’s generosity to Senate employees, and Gigi Reyes’ persuasive presence. She would be part of political decisions and deal with senators when needed. She is known to be close to senators Edgardo Angara (he was godfather in her wedding to former husband Inky), Jinggoy Estrada, Chiz Escudero, Bong Revilla, and, of course, had known Napoles herself. In the past she would fly to Macau to look for potential locators in the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority in Enrile’s bailiwick. On August 31, Reyes again left the country for Macau – before the complaints were filed against her and Enrile with the Office of the Ombudsman. As an administrator, she was very good and “very efficient,” Senate insiders said. But she was not the type who would do things on her own. “Boss, okay na ba ito (Boss, is this okay?)” she would often ask Enrile, checking with him on major decisions. “She is the sort of person who will protect her principal, but will not do anything against his interest or without his permission,” said one who knew her. “Whatever she did had the blessings of JPE.” – with Marites D.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/musk-defense-fraud-trial-2018-tweet-tesla-funding/,[],"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Elon Musk, Tesla Incorporation’s chief executive, testified on Friday, January 20, that investors do not always react to his Twitter messages as he expects, defending himself in a fraud trial over his 2018 tweet that he had funding to take the electric carmaker private. Musk’s testimony began with questions about his use of Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October. He called it the most democratic way to communicate but said his tweets did not always affect Tesla stock the way he expected. “Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly,” Musk told the jury in San Francisco federal court. Musk testified for less than 30 minutes before court adjourned until Monday and he was not asked about his 2018 tweet that he was considering taking Tesla private and that he had “funding secured.” He is expected to address why he has insisted he had Saudi investor backing to take Tesla private, which never occurred, and whether he knowingly made a materially misleading statement with his tweet. The case is a rare securities class action trial and the plaintiffs have already cleared high legal hurdles, with US Judge Edward Chen ruling last year that Musk’s funding post was untruthful and reckless. Shareholders alleged that Musk lied when he sent the tweet, costing investors millions. Musk, wearing a dark suit over a white button-down shirt, spoke softly and in a sometimes bemused manner, a contrast to his occasional combative testimony in past trials. Musk described the difficulties the company went through around the time he sent the “funding secured” tweet, including bets by short-sellers that the stock would fall. “A bunch of sharks on Wall Street wanted Tesla to die, very badly,” he said, describing short-sellers, who profit when a stock falls in price. He said short-sellers plant false stories and said the practice should be made illegal. Shares of Tesla ended about 5% higher at $133.42. Earlier on Friday, Tesla investor Timothy Fries told the jury that he lost $5,000 buying Tesla stock after Musk sent the tweet, which sparked volatile swings in Tesla’s stock. Fries said that “funding secured” meant to him that “there had been some vetting, some critical review of those funding sources.” Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, told the jury in his opening statement Wednesday that Musk believed he had financing from Saudi backers and was taking steps to make the deal happen. Fearing leaks to the media, Musk tried to protect the “everyday shareholder” by sending the tweet, which contained “technical inaccuracies,” Spiro said. Guhan Subramanian, a Harvard Law School professor, told the jury that Musk’s behavior in 2018 was “unprecedented” and “incoherent” in terms of structuring a corporate deal because he went public with his intent without proper financial or legal analysis. A jury of six men and three women will decide whether the tweet artificially inflated Tesla’s share price by playing up the status of funding for the deal, and if so, by how much. The defendants include current and former Tesla directors, whom Spiro said had “pure” motives in their response to Musk’s plan. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/watch-how-messy-import-clearances-led-to-skyrocketing-onion-prices/,['RALF RIVAS'],"MANILA, Philippines– The onion inflation crisis could have been avoided, if the government only allowed the private sector to import when it wanted to. In a Rappler Talk episode, Dr. Roehlano Briones, senior research fellow at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, explained that blocking import clearances and not letting the market move accordingly resulted to onion prices climbing to as high as P600 per kilo – almost twice the price of a kilo of beef. “If the government just conducted business as usual, I don’t think that we would have dramatic increases in price,” Briones said. The government is able to intervene in the onion trade by issuing sanitary and phytosanitary permits, which specifies quality and sanitary standards of any imported good. While the government can’t usually block imports outright, sanitary certificates can serve as a barrier of importation. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. recently approved onion imports through the continuation of the said permits. Farmer groups, however, fear that it’s too late, as onion harvest is underway. But for Briones, the private sector calculates the inherent risks of importing while local farmers harvest. “Entrepreneurs think if they should import or not. It would be difficult if they bring in expensive imports while farmers harvest, they will lose money. They will have to balance the timing and volume of imports,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-government-pushes-private-sector-led-maharlika-wealth-fund/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been selling a different version of the Maharlika Investment Fund to bigwig foreign investors in Davos, Switzerland – one that is envisioned to be “more led” by the private sector through the stock market. The controversial sovereign wealth fund was recently “reengineered” over the holidays, revealed House ways and means committee chairman Joey Salceda. “I don’t know whether I should be revealing this but since nandito na rin lang (we’re here anyway): Right after Christmas, we were commissioned – me and three others – to rewrite, to essentially reengineer the Maharlika Investment Fund,” Salceda said in an interview in ANC’s Headstart on Friday, January 20. Salceda, who led the technical working group that hammered out the House bill’s details, said that the revised version has dropped dividends of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas from the fund’s start-up capital. Instead, it will now source initial funds from the dividends of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs). Salceda gave assurances that these dividends will be “real surpluses.” “It’s very new. It’s basically securitization of about P44.3 billion in annual dividends. So these are real surpluses, including, for example, PDIC at P13 billion,” Salceda said. “These are dividends from GOCCs, so by its nature, they are already surpluses. ‘Yung naghahanap na dapat surplus siya, e ito, surplus (For those that are looking for surpluses, well here’s the surplus),” he said. Salceda said that under the version favored by Marcos, the proposed fund would now rely on the private sector for funding through an initial public offering at the Philippine Stock Exchange. He expected that the IPO could “easily raise” as much as P1.2 trillion in private capital, which Salceda said would make the government own less than 50% of the Maharlika Investment Corporation. “Upon IPO, it’s no longer a GOCC. It’s essentially another listed company in the Philippine stock market. It’s up to the President, but the recommendation is that the government will own less than 50%. So it will be private, basically,” he said. “I think it will be more private-led, but it definitely will have public guidance, basically, government guidance,” he later clarified. This new version of the Maharlika Fund is what Marcos planned to pitch to investors at the World Economic Forum. Salceda said that several big investment banks had already expressed interest. “We want this to succeed, and this is the one that was actually sold by the President in Davos,” the congressman said. The proposed Maharlika Investment Fund has faced fierce criticism from lawmakers and economists, who have raised concerns about its impact on the BSP’s independence and possible fund management. Nevertheless, the House speedily approved the bill. Although the Senate has yet to begin discussions around the proposed sovereign wealth fund, Salceda hoped that the revised version would survive the upper chamber’s scrutiny. “’Yung dati kasi, hindi naman papasa (The previous version would never pass)…. But now, I think this is well thought out,” he said. In an interview with Philippine media in Zurich on Friday, January 20, Marcos said the idea of raising funds through an IPO  was a suggestion “from one of the CEOs” while discussing the proposed fund. “Sabi niya, isipin natin (He said, let’s think about it). We’ll see kung bagay sa Pilipinas (if it would suit the Philippines) …. So we have to design it very specifically to the Philippine condition and that’s what the legislators are trying to do now to make sure na babagay para sa atin (that it would suit us) and it will be a good thing for us. So that’s the process that we’re undergoing now,” he said. – Rappler.com"

In the capital Lima, police officers used tear gas to repel demonstrators throwing glass bottles and stones, as fires burned in the streets, local TV footage showed. In the country’s southern Puno region, some 1,500 protesters attacked a police station in the town of Ilave, Interior Minister Vicente Romero said in a statement to news media. A police station in Zepita, Puno, was also on fire, Romero said. Health authorities in Ilave reported eight patients hospitalized with injuries, including broken arms and legs, eye contusions, and punctured abdomens. By late afternoon, 58 people had been injured nationwide in demonstrations, according to a report from Peru’s ombudsman. The unrest followed a day of turmoil in Thursday, when one of Lima’s most historic buildings burned to the ground, as President Dina Boluarte vowed to get tougher on “vandals.” The destruction of the building, a near-century-old mansion in central Lima, was described by officials as the loss of a “monumental asset.” Authorities are investigating the causes. Romero on Friday claimed the blaze was “duly planned and arranged.” Thousands of protesters descended on Lima this week calling for change and angered by the protests’ mounting death toll, which officially stood at 45 on Friday. Protests have rocked Peru since President Pedro Castillo was ousted in December after he attempted to dissolve the legislature to prevent an impeachment vote. In southern Peru, Glencore’s major Antapaccay copper mine suspended operations on Friday after protesters attacked the premises – one of the largest in the country – for the third time this month. Airports in Arequipa, Cusco and the southern city of Juliaca were also attacked by demonstrators this week, delivering a fresh blow to Peru’s tourism industry. “It’s nationwide chaos, you can’t live like this. We are in a terrible uncertainty – the economy, vandalism,” said Lima resident Leonardo Rojas. The government has extended a state of emergency to six regions, curtailing some civil rights. But President Dina Boluarte has dismissed calls to resign and to hold snap elections, instead calling for dialogue and promising to punish those involved in the unrest. “All the rigor of the law will fall on those people who have acted with vandalism,” Boluarte said on Thursday. Some locals pointed the finger at Boluarte for “not taking any action” to quell the protests, which began on Dec. 7 in response to the ouster and arrest of Castillo. Human rights groups have accused the police and army of using deadly firearms. The police say protesters have used weapons and homemade explosives. – Rappler.com"

In an interview conducted and released by RTVM, an agency tasked to document the President’s activities, former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo piled on praises for Marcos at the World Economic Forum (WEF). “Napakahalaga ang World Economic Forum dahil napakaraming mga political and business influencers na dumadalo dito sa Davos. At matagal nang paniniwala ko na magiging maganda ang dating ni Pangulong Marcos dito sa Davos,” said Arroyo, in an interview on RTVM’s official channels. (The WEF is important because a lot of political and business influencers come here to Davos. I’ve long believed that President Marcos would have a good impression in Davos.) Arroyo, who is part of the official delegation, added: “He is Western-educated at intelehente siya at articulate siya. To put it in English, he speaks their language. Alam ng Pangulo na sa pag-unlad ng ating bansa, napakaimportante ang pagsasama ng gobyerno at ng pribadong sektor.” (READ: Oxford: Bongbong Marcos’ special diploma ‘not a full graduate diploma’) (He is Western-educated, intelligent, and articulate…. The President knows that in order for the country to progress, it’s important to bring together the government and private sector.) Arroyo wasn’t the only public official interviewed and featured by RTVM during the Davos visit. Interviews with Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual, Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, Private Sector Advisory Council Lead and Aboitiz Group CEO Sabin Aboitiz, and Alliance Global CEO Kevin Tan were also up on RTVM’s channels. In all these interviews, the top government and business officials explained why they were in Davos and detailed how Marcos had been received by delegates to the forum. It’s an interesting move by Malacañang, which has thus far been quiet on criticism over Marcos’ decision to fly to Davos even as the country struggles with the high cost of food. RTVM is directly under the Office of the President. These interviews have also been the topic of press releases from the Presidential News Desk, an agency under the Presidential Communications Office or the messaging arm of the Palace. Senator Mark Villar, who had joined several of Marcos’ trips in the past, vouched for the supposed support of the Davos elite they met for the controversial Maharlika wealth fund. The proposal has been approved by the House but has yet to be tackled by the Senate. In Davos, thus far, Marcos has met with WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab, foreign business executives, and Filipino executives who also flew to the Swiss town for the forum. He’s also participated in panels and a lengthy conversation with Børge Brende. He caps off the Swiss excursion with a gathering of Filipinos based there and nearby European countries before flying back to Manila on January 21. Arroyo, an economist before joining politics, also heaped praise on the Philippines’ economic team. “In fact, historically, maganda ang track record ng ating bansa na magagaling ang mga economic managers, kung sino pa man ang pangulo. So ibig sabihin stable ang pagpalakad ng ating ekonomiya, kaya maganda ang ating economic forecast sa 2023,” she said. (Our country has a good track record of having skilled economic managers no matter who the president is. That means our economy is stable, and that’s why our 2023 forecast is promising.) Marcos himself has said that the Davos visit won’t be too different from the others he’s made in his first seven months in office – save for his new pitch for the proposed Maharlika sovereign wealth fund. The Philippine President has undertaken three state visits – to Indonesia, Singapore, and China – as well as several working or official visits to the US, Cambodia, Thailand, and Belgium for regional and international assemblies and forums. In all these visits, the message is almost exactly the same: to sell the Philippines as a good place to invest in. Seven months in, however, those visits have yet to yield anything completely new since these meetings held around the world are typically done to re-affirm old commitments and to begin discussions for new ones. – Rappler.com"

A cabinet reshuffle proposed by Ardern would go ahead, but Finance Minister Grant Robertson was likely to continue in the role, he said. He said he had spoken to Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who tweeted the two had had “a warm discussion.” In a surprise announcement on Thursday, January 19, Ardern said she had “no more in the tank” to lead the country and would step down and not seek reelection. First elected to parliament for the Labour Party in 2008, the 44-year-old Hipkins became a household name fronting the government’s response to the pandemic after being appointed minister for COVID-19 in November 2020. Hipkins is currently minister for police, education and public service, as well as leader of the House. A Horizon Research snap poll obtained by local media organization Stuff on Friday showed that Hipkins was the most popular potential candidate among voters, with the backing of 26% of those surveyed. Hipkins’ confirmation by Labour lawmakers at a meeting on Sunday afternoon is expected to be a formality. Ardern will then tender her resignation to the Governor General before Hipkins is appointed. If confirmed, Hipkins will be prime minister until the party’s term ends. A general election will be held on October 14, with some opinion polls showing Labour will struggle to hold on to power. A Taxpayers’ Union-Curia poll released Friday based on data from before Ardern’s announcement she would resign showed Labour’s popularity falling to 31.7%, while the opposition New Zealand National Party was backed by 37.2% of respondents. New Zealand Green Party, Labour’s traditional coalition partner, said in a statement that they were looking forward to working with Hipkins. “Chris will make an excellent Prime Minister and we look forward to continuing our work together, for the rest of this term and the next,” said Green Party co-leader James Shaw. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/liver-king-how-rise-mega-influencers-put-consumers-at-risk/,[],"In the age of vloggers, influencers and content creators it might seem hard to imagine a world without YouTube. But back when the first ever video was uploaded in April 2005, showing a man visiting a zoo, it was not really clear who would want to watch it, or how YouTube could make money. These days, anyone can make money online by building a brand around being themselves – or not – as Liver King, an extremely buff fitness creator recently found out. Liver King, is the social media personality of Brian Johnson, a muscular and often shirtless TikTok star who promotes “ancestral living” as something he does to be “strong, healthy and happy (autoimmune-free, eczema-free, allergy-free, fatigue-free.” For Johnson, this means eating platefuls of bull’s testicles, raw animal livers and cows’ brains. He sells his lifestyle in the form of nutritional supplements, personalized dietary advice, as well as workout exercises – and he also promotes different services and products to his 1.7 million followers on Instagram and 3.8 million followers on TikTok. That is, he did until leaked emails revealed that Johnson’s looks were not so much explained by the performance of his products, but by a monthly US$12,000 (£10,000) investment in steroids, which he hid from his fans. Liver King is now being sued for US$25 million by his followers who feel they were tricked into buying his muscle-building supplements. For as long as the internet has been in existence, users have been searching for creative (and sometimes scandalous) ways to monetize themselves. Back in the early days, some tried to ride the e-commerce wave, going as far as using auctioning websites to sell the right to name their unborn child, or their own virginity. Others went the advertising route, auctioning off parts of their face to become walking billboards for internet companies willing to pay them. Hostgator M. Dotcom was one of them. Between 2005 and 2008, he acquired around 30 ads on his face (mostly for porn websites and online casinos) before his body’s real estate value plummeted from four to two figures. The Liver King exposé may have been shocking to fans, but influencer-related scandals are nothing new. And one of the biggest, the infamous 2017 Fyre Festival, that went bust after the organizers spent tremendous amounts of money on Instagram influencers and hidden advertising, marked a shift to the age of the mega-influencer. Be they famous people from the “real” world – like sports stars and entertainers – or native internet celebrities such as YouTubers like Jenna Marbles, this was a time when influencer marketing became a desirable internet sales strategy. Anybody with a following, a phone and a YouTube account could start making (a lot of) money from brand deals. These days mega-influencers are no longer the only stakeholders of an ever-growing industry. Instead, monetization options on social media platforms have exploded, meaning that more and more people now make a living online. As mapped in a recent study for the European Parliament, subscriptions, donations from live streams and the selling of merchandise or digital content online is big business. Even the terminology has changed: from the advertising-ridden “influencers,” to “content creators” – everyday internet entrepreneurs monetizing their identity on the social media platforms of their choice. Just like the Liver King, who has fans and subscribers on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, creators are often active on many platforms simultaneously. They combine whatever options they can to maximize their activity, depending on the algorithms of the platform as well as consumer trends. Through their content, creators establish trust, relatability and authenticity with their audiences. This one-sided relationship that a social media user engages in with a media persona is known as a “parasocial relationship.” This is where users form attachments with public figures that feel (and are) very real. Research shows that these kinds of relationships can influence a person’s beliefs, attitudes and purchasing behavior as well as levels of trust in various groups. And when creators withhold their commercial incentives or hide inconvenient truths (see Liver King) they lie to and mislead their audiences. From a legal perspective, this raises many questions. Branded content, paid partnerships and content creation can open up whole new worlds to online entrepreneurs but it’s also important to acknowledge that commercial activity comes with certain legal obligations though currently the rules vary from one country to another. In the UK, for example, an influencer must disclose when they’ve received any form of monetary payment, a loan of a product or service, or have been given the product they’re posting about for free. In my current project, which looks at how to tame influencer marketing, I want to find out what stricter transparency obligations on social media platforms might look like and if these are needed. Many governments around the world, including in the UK, France and the US, have been already investigating how to further regulate influencers. And I believe that this is something that needs to happen sooner rather than later. Indeed, given that many of us can struggle to tell the difference between ads and regular content online it’s clear that influencers could be doing a lot more in the way of transparency. – Rappler.com This article originally appeared in The Conversation.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/mendiola-massacre-lord-dont-abandon-me/,[],"Not even for a nanosecond did gunfire stop. As gunfire roared — while face-down on the pavement by the wall of Corona Book Supply — I kept hearing a male voice reverberating, giving me the impression that it was coming from someone who had been aimlessly, mindlessly walking around. Amid the gunfire? I thought then that it must have been a “doomsday” fanatic whom I occasionally saw in various parts of Metro Manila: wearing long white gowns scribbled with strange handwritings, sporting long disheveled hair, looking up the sky, as if looking for some faraway sign, with eyebrows furrowed. I thought it was someone like him. Then I understood his words. “Diyos ko, ‘wag Mo ‘kong pabayaan. Maglilingkod pa ‘ko sa sambayanan (My God, don’t forsake me. I will still be serving the people)!” He kept imploring, repeating those words. In anguish. As he uttered “Maglilingkod pa ‘ko sa sambayanan (I will still be serving the people),” there was stubbornness, persistence — unrelenting, even defiant — conviction. Service to the people was his only reason for wanting to live longer. The tone of his voice conveyed that he knew that nobody at that precise moment can help him. His utterance becoming slower and slower; his voice, fainter and fainter. I was surprised to realize that the voice belonged to the same bloodied man whom I saw earlier near the gutter. His was the voice that kept reverberating earlier as if walking around aimlessly as I was faced down on the ground by the wall of Corona Book Supply. I glanced at him and saw one of his raised hands weakening, slowly falling down to the ground. From the edge of the wall, Mat and I got back to the gutter. We were about two meters away from the same bloodied man. He was still lying on his back. His other arm was still raised, gesturing for help. Mat told him: “Pare, steady ka lang diyan (Bro, just lie in there).” Mat’s words to the man were soothing. Those were suffused with the energy of pagdamay and pagmamalasakit (core Filipino cultural ethos that embody and manifest the synthesis of lovingkindness, compassion, empathy, and concern for others in an active way and by means of direct, concrete action). I felt grateful and looked up to Mat with gratitude and total respect. To me, Mat’s words made an enormous difference to the person. As Mat uttered those words, I saw the man’s weakening. His arm slowly fell to the road pavement. Slowly, his head turned to his side facing us. We moved back again towards the wall of Corona Book Supply. The man’s silence crept up to me. Amid the chaos, I was mesmerized. I saw a mist quickly rise up and briefly turn into a cloud on top of him. Although I was aware that the mist did not originate from his environs, I nevertheless quickly checked his immediate surroundings to make sure that the mist that morphed into a cloud did not come from the smoke of gunpowder, his environs or elsewhere. None. And at that precise moment, I intuitively grasped a powerful message, directed to me, as if an injunction. An invisibility — from or within the slain man — imparted to me a message, an injunction, that right there and then struck me. Faster than the blink of an eye, simultaneously with that message, I saw (albeit not in the physical, but clairvoyant sense), the image of two lines — one horizontal, the other vertical — move to form the shape of a cross; along with an instructive energy for me to live so accordingly. Intuitively, I grasped its mystical meaning: live vertically — communion with the Divine Supreme God — and horizontally — in service to others, for the people. It was a vertical and horizontal relationship. Vertical with the Divine Supreme God, and horizontal, with the rest of my fellow human beings. Subsumed in this mystical moment was the message to me, with a sense of utter certainty, that I will survive, and live through the ongoing bloodbath. The energy of the bloodied man’s utterance — “Diyos ko, ‘wag mo ‘kong pabayaan. Maglilingkod pa ‘ko sa sambayanan!” — enveloped my whole being with an aura of peace and love. It was soft, quiet, loving, peaceful, assuring, and gentle. It was a split-second moment of mystical experience. I grasped the injunction and moved quickly again. Moments later, when only intermittent gunfire from afar can be heard, I turned to the man on the ground. Right away, I knew he was already lifeless. I would, moments later, carry him — the first one — followed by two other fallen marchers with the help of Mat and other photojournalists. His body was still warm, supple. His head swayed downward on its own weight as we lifted and carried him towards a media service vehicle. The silence I felt deep inside me was quite heavy. I never came to know the name of the man. My heart nudged me with the imperative of trying to know who he was, his story, his name. Yet, I never had the chance to. (I tried but thought that none of the remains of the marchers whose wake I had attended later in Mount Carmel Church, Quezon City, and in the office of the labor organization Alyansa ng mga Manggagawa sa Malabon (Malabon Labor Alliance) in Malabon, Metro Manila were probably his.) The fourth, farthest man from where we were, had already been quickly carried away, first by two, then by a third photojournalist who ran to help the fallen marcher. An act of humanity. What can a person do? Knowingly carrying someone whom you knew from the sight and feel of it to be already dead? Yet still carrying his body as if he could still be revived and saved? I knew no such miracle will ever happen. I knew they were all dead. But something inside of me cannot resist the act of helping carry their dead bodies to be driven away to hospitals. No, leaving them there was not an option at all. An act of humanity maybe? Compassion? Empathy? Respect for the fallen? Not a single soldier, not a single law enforcer came to the succor of any of the fallen. Photojournalists — clutching their camera in one hand, or simply strapping it around their neck — without any hesitation, did. Media drivers quickly drove their marked PRESS jeepneys to meet photojournalists carrying the bloodied, slain marchers. And after their unmoving bodies were slumped atop the hood, drivers in quick succession, sped away. None of the marchers could have survived. At that moment, I greatly admired and respected the photojournalists who ran towards the slain marchers, lifted, carried, and brought their bodies to media vehicles, and whose drivers sped away to take them to hospitals immediately after gunfire stopped. At that juncture, it was not over yet because police officers wearing gas masks on board military jeeps chased and fired more teargas cannisters towards demonstrators who were no longer visible from where we stood. Several popping sounds can be heard from afar as police fired tear gas cannisters. Tear gas, smokeless, continued to bite harshly. Eyes, lungs, skin. All over. – Rappler.com An award-winning investigative journalist and licensed attorney, Perfecto Caparas serves as a teaching fellow and founding director of the Center for Holistic International Human Rights Law Praxis of the National University of the Union of Myanmar-Burmese American Community Institute."

Gathering at a military base, the officials pledged missiles, stinger air defense systems, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, training, and other equipment and services. Britain, which has already announced plans to send tanks to Ukraine, will also send 600 Brimstone missiles, Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said as he outlined details. Poland was sending S-60 anti-aircraft guns with 70,000 rounds of ammunition and was ready to donate a company of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, “pending (a) wider coalition” of Leopard donors, according to a joint statement from the meeting. The potential supply of Leopard tanks is expected to be high on the agenda when a broader group of nations, including the United States, meets on Friday at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base. The United States and Germany tried on Thursday to resolve a stand-off over the Leopard, which the German government has so far resisted supplying to Ukraine, but no conclusion has so far been communicated. Kyiv has pleaded for the tank, which it believes would help it to turn the tide against Russian forces. Hours after the meeting the Danish government announced it would donate 19 French-made Caesar howitzer artillery systems to Ukraine, fulfilling the wish of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy but stunting the Nordic country’s military build-up. – Rappler.com"

Casper Ruud, Ons Jabeur, and Matteo Berrettini were among the players featured in Netflix series to exit this year’s tournament early, while Nick Kyrgios, Paula Badosa, and Ajla Tomljanovic were forced to pull out before it began.

https://www.rappler.com/business/rcbc-appeals-new-york-court-loss-to-bangladesh-bank/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – A Philippine bank at the center of an unsolved $81 million cyber heist has appealed a New York Supreme Court decision to dismiss the bank’s motion to throw out the Bangladesh central bank’s lawsuit against it. In February 2016, unidentified hackers used fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system to steal $81 million from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The money was sent to accounts at Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) RCB.PS and then vanished into the casino industry in the Philippines. Bangladesh Bank has accused RCBC and several others, including top executives, of conspiring to steal its money. The Manila-based Rizal bank denies the allegations. The New York Supreme Court ruled on January 13 that, contrary to Rizal bank’s argument, it does have jurisdiction over the case, and dismissed Rizal bank’s motion against Bangladesh Bank. In the same ruling, the court ordered the Bangladesh central bank and RCRC to initiate mediation. In response to the ruling, Rizal bank said it would continue to fight the case. “The decision and order merely resolved the jurisidictional issues and is not in any way a finding of liability on the part of RCBC, or any of the individual defendants,” it said in a stock exchange disclosure. Bangladesh Bank has welcomed the court ruling, saying in a statement this week that it clears the way for the matter to progress in court in New York as needed. A banking sector source in Dhaka, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that according to the Bangladesh central bank, RCBC should now come forward for mediation or prepare for a long court battle. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/uk-bishops-apologize-lgbtqi-people-shameful-treatment/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Church of England bishops apologized to LGBTQI+ people on Friday, January 20, for the rejection and hostility they have faced, with the Archbishop of Canterbury acknowledging that the religious body was still “very divided” on the subject. The apology comes days after the Church of England set out proposals developed by the bishops that showed it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to get married in its churches, but said priests could bless them in church. “We have not loved you as God loves you, and that is profoundly wrong,” the bishops said in an open letter. “We affirm, publicly and unequivocally, that LGBTQI+ people are welcome and valued: we are all children of God. “The occasions on which you have received a hostile and homophobic response in our churches are shameful and for this we repent.” The Church of England, central to one of the world’s oldest Christian institutions, the Anglican communion, stood by its teaching that marriage is between “one man and one woman” in the proposals. Gay marriage was legalized in Britain in 2013. A spokesperson for gay and transgender lobby group Stonewall said the Church of England had “once again” fallen short on being inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+ Christians. “An apology only goes so far when so many LGBTQ+ Christians have faced hostility and discrimination for who they are,” the spokesperson told Reuters via e-mail. The most high-profile support from a religious leader for same-sex couples to get married in churches has come from the Bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who apologized in November for having been slow to change his views. On Friday, Croft said: “It is very good for us to be able to say today that the church can now offer public services of blessing, but we know that we have further to go.” Croft’s call for a change has been backed publicly only by a few of his fellow bishops, who along with clergy and laity form the Church of England’s governing body, known as the General Synod. “We’re divided, there’s no point in pretending otherwise. The Church of England and the Anglican Communion are very divided,” Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, told reporters on Friday, ahead of a meeting of the synod next month where the proposals will be deliberated further. “I’m sure that discussions will continue. But this is an enormously important point, not only within the Anglican Communion and the Church of England, but also across the global church,” he added. “It’s a long journey.

Djokovic hyper-extended his left hamstring during a tune-up event in Adelaide earlier this month.

A grant agreement formalizing the deal was signed by NOW Telecom Chairman and CEO Mel Velarde and Nokia Bell Labs Managing Partner Stefan Wilhem during the Philippines and US 10th bilateral strategic dialogue held in Manila on Friday, January 20. The agreement – a follow up to an earlier announcement made by the Philippines and US to partner on 5G networks during the visit of US Vice President Kamala Harris to the Southeast Asian nation – sees the company move one step closer to establishing its own 5G network in the country. In a grant offering technical assistance, the USTDA earlier identified the design of a 5G network as the first of three components it would assist, followed by the planning and piloting of such networks in the country. According to a statement from the US embassy, NOW Telecom chose the New Jersey-based Nokia Bell Labs, the research arm of Nokia, to conduct a feasibility study on the proposed 5G network. During the signing of the grant agreement, US Assistant State Secretary Daniel Kritenbrink likewise highlighted how the venture seeks to provide the Philippines safer online access. “Filipinos can and should be secure online. Securing against malicious cyber activities is difficult even in the best of times, but it is infinitely more difficult when the risk comes from the entity that built and may maintain access to a telecommunications network,” he said. “This 5G grant demonstrates the US commitment to developing quality digital infrastructure and increasing access to affordable connectivity in the Philippines,” Kritenbrink added. Earlier in 2019, former US state secretary Mike Pompeo warned the Philippines of “security risks” posed by Chinese communications equipment provider Huawei Technologies, which partnered with the Philippines’ two telecommunication players, PLDT and Globe Telecom, in the rollout of their 5G networks. With a feasibility study, NOW Telecom is expected to receive “the necessary analysis designs, and plans” for the implementation of its 5G initiative. “It will also include the establishment of a 5G pilot network at multiple sites in Metro Manila to validate network performance, test 5G use cases, and provide data to inform larger scale deployment,” the US embassy said.

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/gigi-reyes-release-supreme-court-ruling-changes-game-habeas-corpus/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Dennise Velasco and five trade union organizers were arrested during Human Rights Day on December 10, 2020 along with journalist Lady Ann Salem. They were dubbed “Human Rights Day 7.” Velasco’s legal counsels from the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. They questioned the legality of his detention citing as basis the “validity of the issuance and implementation of the search warrant,” NUPL president Ephraim “Rey” Cortez told Rappler. Unfortunately, the petition was junked by the court on the basis of Ilagan vs. Enrile ruling of 1985. This Marcos-era ruling states that the writ of habeas corpus can no longer be invoked after a person has already been charged. The criminal case against Velasco, which stemmed from allegations of illegal possession of firearms and explosives, was later dismissed by the court. The search warrant against him was quashed based on the irregularity in its issuance – the same issue the NUPL lawyers raised in their writ of habeas corpus petition, Cortez said. “Had the habeas corpus petition been resolved on merits, and not technicality because of Ilagan vs. Enrile, Denisse would have been released immediately, but he stayed in jail for almost two years,” Cortez said. For the NUPL, prior to this latest SC ruling, the reality was that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was hard to invoke due to the Ilagan vs. Enrile decision and other factors. Cortez added that the NUPL firmly believes that the writ of habeas corpus should also be applied to people who have already been charged in court. “This decision (Reyes case) is good if it will be used as the prevailing jurisprudence in lieu of Ilagan vs. Enrile, and if it will be applied to other cases as well, especially the nameless and faceless victims who have been languishing in jails under questionable circumstances,” he said. Unlike Velasco, who was a victim of a crackdown against militant activists under Rodrigo Duterte’s administration, lawyer Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes was arrested and detained for allegedly stealing millions of pesos through fake projects and questionable nongovernmental organizations in relation to the pork barrel scam. (READ: Gigi Reyes owns 10 properties worth P50M) Reyes was the former chief of staff and alleged paramour of former senator, now presidential legal counsel Juan Ponce Enrile. She and Enrile were later arrested for graft and plunder charges. Almost nine years since she was jailed, Reyes walked free from detention on Thursday, January 19, after the SC ruled in her favor and granted her the privilege of writ of habeas corpus. The ruling created a new form of the writ of habeas corpus that can be invoked by other petitioners. Traditionally, this extraordinary writ is used to challenge the detention of a person, lobby for their release, and “to inquire into the cause of detention of a person.” Lawyer Kristina Conti of NUPL and the Public Interest Law Center said a “successful habeas corpus petition allows the release of a person under custody and dismissal of the case when the detention has been shown to be without legal basis.” In her petition, Reyes argued that she is entitled to the privilege of writ of habeas corpus by reason of delay and alleged violation of her constitutional right to speedy trial. Reyes also reasoned that she has been in detention “longer than any other accused similarly charged.” She cited the following government officials and the days they spent behind bars: Reyes also pointed out she had filed various petitions before the High Court for her release on multiple grounds but none was granted. She therefore invoked the writ of habeas corpus. Reyes also presented the following points: In its ruling, the High Court agreed with Reyes’ arguments on her constitutional right to speedy trial, and that her detention had “become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.” The SC not only ordered Reyes’ temporary release, but also made it clear that this extraordinary writ can be applied to all cases of legal confinement and detention. Not only that, it can also be availed by the accused even though the charge has already been filed or if the accused is already under the authorities’ custody. An accused can also invoke the writ when his/her custody “became illegal due to the grave abuse of his or her constitutional rights.” The court also gave at least four points as to why this privilege was granted on the ground of violation of the constitutional right to speedy trial: Lawyer Theodore “Ted” Te, former SC spokesperson, said the High Court’s ruling on granting the writ also “widened the space and opportunities” for others similarly accused, especially those whose bail is discretionary and “whose rights to speedy trial are violated.” Although the SC did not explicitly state that it changed the rule on the writ of habeas corpus, it could still be perceived that way, Te told Rappler. “The SC did not expressly say the Rule on Habeas Corpus is amended but with the issuance of guidelines pursuant to the Court’s rule-making power, it may be reasonably understood that the rule has been modified.” The ruling did not only create new rules on who can avail of the writ, but also demonstrated the other uses of the legal remedy. Because of the decision, a new way for temporary release became available. The “interim” writ of habeas corpus – as Te calls it – is similar, but not exactly like bail, the human rights lawyer explained. The “interim” writ of habeas corpus was also differentiated from the two other instances when interim bail is granted. “Interim bail” means “bail pending trial where bail is discretionary.” “Interim bail 1 (affidavits presented hearsay, as found by the SC pre-arraignment), interim bail 2 (health condition) both involved the same applicant,” Te said. This also means that aside from the available bail options, an accused can also still invoke the writ because it’s different from the two others. The decision also made it clear that there are now at least three types of writ of habeas corpus that can be invoked: pre-charge, post-conviction, and interim (from the Reyes case). This means a person can invoke the extraordinary writ before a case was filed against him/ her, after the conviction or judgment of the court, and even while the court proceedings are still ongoing. Still on the SC ruling on Reyes, Te pointed out that other detainees like former senator Leila de Lima can ask the SC for her temporary liberty: “Since the January 17, 2023 Resolution in GR No. 254838 (1st Div) creating a WRIT OF INTERIM HABEAS CORPUS is not designated as one that applies pro hac vice (only in this instance), Leila de Lima should file a petition for HC tomorrow as a test.” For Conti, who handles mostly cases involving activists and victims of Duterte’s drug war, the new jurisprudence on the writ of habeas corpus will help many detainees, especially political prisoners facing so-called trumped-up charges. “In the new habeas corpus guidelines, the court, when petitioned, will be looking at why the trials have been long drawn out and who have caused the delays. Unreasonable delay, whether asked for or caused by any of the parties – the accused, the prosecution, or even the court – will certainly be a basis to invoke habeas corpus and temporary release,” she said. Conti also noted that the SC ruling on Reyes is important because the release is based on a constitutional right. The decision will help marginalized sectors because there is now an option to seek temporary release without the need for money, she added. Lawyer Carlos Isagani Zarate, a former Bayan Muna lawmaker, shared the same position that the new writ should be invoked by political prisoners. But he said that if the ruling will not apply to them, it will be another example of “inequity.” “If this does not apply to political prisoners or even ordinary persons long deprived of liberty, then it can be read as another glaring example of the inequity of the country’s justice system – that is, if you are not rich and/or powerful, you will languish in prison, even if you are innocent,” he said in a statement. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-lunar-new-year-celebrate-the-cat/,[],"HANOI, Vietnam – As China, Japan, and other East Asian countries prepare to celebrate the start of the Lunar Year of the Rabbit on Sunday, January 22, the people of Vietnam will be an exception – welcoming instead the Year of the Cat. There is no official explanation for when and why the Vietnamese embraced the cat instead of the rabbit. Another smaller difference in the otherwise almost identical celebrations of the 12-year Chinese Zodiac cycle is Vietnam’s adoption of the ubiquitous water buffalo in the Year of the Ox. Ngo Huong Giang, a Hanoi-based culture researcher, said one reason for opting for the cat might be that the term for the rabbit in the Chinese astrological ordering system is pronounced “mao” in Mandarin, which sounds similar to the Vietnamese word for cat. Raising rabbits is also not common in Vietnam. What is certain is that the Vietnamese are not willing to change their tradition. “It doesn’t have the same power as a cat”, Hanoi resident, Ngo Quy Dung, said of the rabbit, as he proudly noted that he was born 60 years ago in the Year of the Cat. Another resident of Hanoi, Nguyen Kim Chi, 64, agreed. “The cat looks more majestic because it also resembles a little tiger,” she said, while taking photographs besides a large cat statue at the Central Park in the capital. Sculptures of cats have popped up in public spaces across the country ahead of the Lunar New Year, together with a myriad of cat charms and gadgets on sale in street stalls. Some cafes keep their cats in their outlets to attract customers. To most Vietnamese, the cat is a firm family friend that helps protect crops and food from rodents, while also chasing away bad spirits and bringing good luck, researcher Giang said. Despite this, cats can still appear on the menu in rural areas, although authorities have banned the practice. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-marcos-at-davos-economic-lies-and-cherry-picking-galore/,['JC PUNONGBAYAN'],"As far as the government is concerned, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s Davos trip is turning out to be a rousing success. But upon closer inspection, and after watching the videos, one quickly realizes that Marcos’ speeches at the Alps are full of hot air, cherry-picking the good bits about the Philippine economy while omitting all the uglier bits. For instance, in his chat with World Economic Forum President Børge Brende, Marcos boasted that the Philippines is the “fastest” growing ASEAN country. This is not true. In the third quarter of 2022, our total output grew by 7.6% compared to the previous year. But Malaysia’s output grew by 14.2%. If Marcos was talking about our economy’s growth for the whole of 2022, we won’t know that statistic until January 26. Where are they getting their info from? Meanwhile, Marcos omitted to say that Philippine inflation reached 8.1% in December 2022, a 14-year high. That’s also higher than the inflation rates in neighboring Thailand (5.9%), Indonesia (5.5%), and Malaysia (4%). Marcos did acknowledge that the country’s debt is now at 62% of GDP (the latest figure is in fact 63.7%, as of the third quarter of 2022), and that this is “still very high for us.” He added that, “The strategy is to have high growth rates and to pull us out of the debt situation.” That’s sensible, but he can’t bank on growth alone. He has to find ways to reduce the budget deficit (and our reliance on debt) by, say, raising taxes (a politically costly move he’s avoided so far) or becoming more prudent about government expenses (the presidential junkets are not helping; the Davos trip is already Marcos’ 8th trip in his first 7 months in office). The President also mentioned the country’s low unemployment rate, 4.1% as of November 2022, saying that’s “lower than it was before the pandemic.” Moreover, he said that his “theory” is that “as long as the unemployment rate stays low, then the recessionary forces are something that we can resist.” True, the Philippines will likely avoid a recession (or economic downturn) in 2023. It’s also true that our unemployment rate is at a record low. But this is because more people are back at work or seeking work, now that we’re returning to our pre-pandemic lives. If you check the data, the labor force participation rate was at 67.5% in November 2022, the highest level since the pandemic started. Even so, the President neglected to say that the underemployment rate – which includes those employed but seeking more pay or hours of work, and arguably the better welfare indicator in countries like the Philippines than unemployment – is still high at 14.4%. This suggests that even if more people are back at work, more than 7 million Filipino workers are still not getting enough pay, especially with high inflation squeezing most people’s wallets and bank accounts these days. Marcos also boasted that “we have the youngest workforce in Asia” with the average age of the Filipino worker at 23.5 years old. Marcos added that “that is a huge demographic dividend.” Actually, 23.5 years refers to the median (not average) age of Filipinos at large (not among workers specifically). Again, who’s misinforming the President? More importantly, the “demographic dividend” refers to the economic and social benefits arising from having such a young and sizable working population, including a boost in spending and our ability to better support minors and the elderly. But demographers have been saying that such claims about the demographic dividend are exaggerated. (Marcos also said in his remarks that the dividend “is not paid out just as a matter of course.”) For instance, even if we’re predominantly English-speaking (another thing Marcos flexed in Davos), we have a 90% learning poverty rate according to the World Bank. How productive and competitive can Filipino workers be if most of us can’t receive quality education to begin with? How can we compete with the labor forces in neighboring Asian neighbors like Vietnam and Malaysia? The President also mentioned that there are about 10 million “overseas workers” sending valuable remittances back home, and such remittances have served as a valuable “buffer” for our economy. However, technically, there were only 1.83 million overseas workers in 2021; the 10 million he referred to is the total number of overseas migrant Filipinos living all over the world. And remittances aren’t coming in as strongly as they did in the early 2000s: they are now growing in the single digits, not double-digits. It’s easy to be impressed by Marcos’ economic remarks; our expectations from the President are so low in the aftermath of the Duterte administration. But aside from giving verbose answers to questions posed at him, Marcos was also quite incoherent at times. Consider this excerpt: “So again, but the on the plus side, what when when I am asked why, why are you so optimistic about the future? And I always say, you know, when when there is when what we have been given is that people say we have to recover. You know, we got into this debt hole and we have to dig ourselves out of it. Don’t really see it the same way. What I see is that we are reforming, reshaping the global economy, and that gives us an opportunity. It’s not a clean sheet of paper, but maybe half clean sheet of paper. We can we can still design and draw…” What? In another instance, he said, “The raw material in terms of in terms of our workforce is very, very advantageous.” What does that even mean? Then he said, “The [overseas Filipino] remittances now comprise about 9% already of…what the government is using to fuel this growth.” Again, what’s that supposed to mean? So in the end, the President and his huge contingent flew thousands of kilometers to an expensive Alpine ski resort town, spending millions of pesos of taxpayers’ money, to spew ill-formed words that ultimately won’t mean a thing for ordinary Filipinos back at home. The truth is, everything Marcos said at Davos could’ve been done in an email. In the words of economics professor Winnie Monsod, “Hasn’t the President ever heard of Zoom?” Marcos himself said little about his pet Maharlika Investment Fund, and largely delegated the task of pitching it to the Davos crowd to Benjamin Diokno, his finance secretary. In one of the small side meetings, Marcos and his delegation pitched Maharlika in front of a crowd of 15 people at most – one of them being his own son Joseph Simon, who just happens to be sitting at the opposite side of the room. Is that it? What a joke. (Check out the footage here.) Marcos is the only president from ASEAN who flew all the way to Davos. Perhaps other ASEAN leaders figured the frivolity of the event, or realized they can grow their economies robustly without having to hobnob with the Davos elite. Still, if there’s one notable thing to come out of Davos, it’s the fact that Marcos spilled the beans about his family’s motivation to return to politics after the 1986 People Power Revolution. He blurted out that his family’s exile in Hawaii “were dark times for the family, and I daresay even for the country.” He added, “For us, to defend ourselves politically, someone had to enter politics and be in the political arena so that at least…not only the legacy of my father, but even our own survival required that somebody go into politics.” This is obvious enough to many Filipinos, and nothing really new. But at least we got from him some honesty for a change. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of the forthcoming book, False Nostalgia: The Marcos Golden Age Myths and How to Debunk Them.

China, which claims the democratically ruled island as its own territory, has increased military activity around Taiwan during the past three years, including staging war games nearby in August after then US-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. In a short, recorded video message before Lunar New Year’s Day on Sunday, the most important holiday in the Chinese-speaking world, Tsai said this year like last would be “full of challenges”. “In the face of the Chinese Communists’ military ships and aircraft frequently harassing Taiwan, or even carrying out exercises around the Taiwan Strait, the government firmly safeguards peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and region,” she said. “The military holds fast to their posts, fully protecting national security, defending our common homeland. I want to thank the labors of our brothers and sisters in the military,” Tsai continued. “In the new year, the government will continue to go all out for the economy and recovery, protect sovereignty and safeguard peace.” China’s air force has regularly crossed the Taiwan Strait’s median line, which had served as an unofficial barrier between the two, since the August drills, and has carried out other exercises near Taiwan. Tsai did not directly offer New Year greetings to China, simply extending best wishes to “friends” around the world celebrating the festival, which is also observed in countries such as Vietnam and South Korea. In her New Year’s address on January 1, Tsai offered to provide China with “necessary assistance” to help it deal with a surge in COVID-19 cases, but said Chinese military activities near the island were not beneficial to peace and stability. – Rappler.com"

Third seed Tsitsipas, the top surviving seed in the men’s draw, checked his phone after a 6-2, 7-6(5), 6-3 win over Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor and reflected on the beautiful day after hours of tennis were lost this week to the heat and stop-start rain. “Fair crack of the whip mate, I mean, it was great,” Tsitsipas said, slipping into the local vernacular. “I think my placement on the serve was exceptional today, I didn’t have a lot of rallies on my serve, which helped a lot. “Kind of kept things clean and I enjoyed the weather today, what a lovely day for tennis it is today, isn’t it?” Tsitsipas has still not dropped a set in the tournament as he chases his maiden Grand Slam, with his chances boosted by the exits of holder Rafa Nadal and second seed Casper Ruud and an injury cloud hanging over favorite Novak Djokovic. But the 2021 French Open runner-up came close, saving a set point in the second set before doubling his advantage following a tiebreak to pave the way for a comfortable win to delight his supporters on Rod Laver Arena. Roared on by Greek fans, many of them from Melbourne, which has the largest population of Greek speakers outside Greece and Cyprus, Tsitsipas will next take on Italian Jannik Sinner in what could be a tricky test. Top seed and women’s favorite Swiatek was equally dominant in her 6-0, 6-1 victory over Cristina Bucsa as she bids to add to her two French Open wins and US Open crown. “A couple of years ago when I was in the fourth round I was really exhausted, and right now I feel this is the right place to be,” Swiatek said. “Hopefully I’m going to continue to playing solid and hopefully I’m going to play more matches here.” Up next for Swiatek is Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina who battled past last year’s Melbourne Park runner-up Danielle Collins, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2. Jessica Pegula was also in a hurry to wrap up her match, as the third-seeded American swatted aside Marta Kostyuk, 6-0, 6-2, to make it seven straight victories in 2023 after a loss to Petra Kvitova in the United Cup. Seventh seed Coco Gauff faltered on two matchpoints and then double-faulted before easing her nerves to save a breakpoint and dismiss left-hander Bernarda Pera, 6-3, 6-2, in a battle between Americans. Nadal’s conqueror Mackenzie McDonald could not continue his run however, as the unseeded American fell to Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka, who won 7-6(6), 6-3, 6-2, though fellow Americans Sebastian Korda and Frances Tiafoe are all in action later in the day. No male US player has captured a Grand Slam title since Andy Roddick at the 2003 US Open, but the country’s hopes had been rekindled with eight players in the third round. Organizers will hope the swift victories continue in the evening having defended their scheduling following a late finish to the previous day after former world No. 1 Andy Murray beat Thanasi Kokkinakis in a five-set epic. That match finished at 4.05 am and Murray described the late finish as a “joke.” Tournament director Craig Tiley ruled out immediate changes after Murray said tennis must aim to avoid late finishes. “At this point there’s no need to change the schedule,” Tiley said. “We’ll always look at it, when we do the debrief – like we do every year. “But at this point, at what it is, we’ve got to fit those matches in the 14 days, so you don’t have many options.” Sinner provided the drama on an otherwise smooth day, as the Italian 15th seed overcame a poor start to his encounter against Marton Fucsovics losing the first two sets before outlasting his Hungarian opponent, 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-0. The 15th seed is among the game’s brightest names having made the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams without going further and showed his class in the last three sets playing superior tennis against a fading Fucsovics. Former French Open winner Barbora Krejcikova, a quarterfinalist at Melbourne Park in 2022, also went safely through with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Anhelina Kalinina and meets Pegula.

This is based on the records of the country’s anti-graft court Sandiganbayan, which has received 10,094 cases of malversation and 7,968 cases of graft against public officials from 1979 to 2016. Reyes, who served as chief of staff of now-Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile when he was Senate president, was accused of plunder, for supposedly funneling Enrile’s Priority Development Assistance Fund into bogus projects of non-governmental organizations. The siphoned pork barrel funds allegedly amounted to P172.8 million. Also tagged in the pork barrel scam – which sparked national outcry in 2013 – were Senator Jinggoy Estrada and Senator Bong Revilla, who were accused of receiving P183.8 million and P224.5 million in kickbacks, respectively. Estrada is out on bail, while Revilla has been cleared in all criminal cases. Reyes walked free on Thursday after the Supreme Court granted her the privilege of writ of habeas corpus, a remedy which it said could be extended to people whose right to speedy trial had been infringed. Enrile’s wife Cristina Castañer Enrile claimed that Gigi Reyes was Enrile’s girlfriend. In February 2017, then-Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales dismissed from government service Reyes and 11 others involved in the pork barrel scam. The Ombudsman said they were found guilty of the administrative charges of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and dishonesty. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/study-documents-glaring-global-light-pollution/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Light pollution caused by the incessant nighttime glow of electric lights appears to be intensifying, according to research using observations from tens of thousands of people at various locations around the world. The study, published on Thursday, January 19, found that the number of visible stars reported at the observation sites from 2011 to 2022 decreased by an amount indicating an increase in nocturnal sky brightness of 7% to 10% annually, higher than previously measured using satellite data. The areas best documented were North America – particularly the United States – and Europe, with minimal data for parts of Asia, Africa and South America. More than 29,000 individual reports were made at more than 19,000 locations worldwide, the researchers said. The “citizen scientists” who provided the data made observations of naked-eye star visibility. The study focused on “skyglow,” the artificial brightening of the night sky due to human-created light scattering in the atmosphere and returning to Earth. The nighttime glow of the sky above a big city is a familiar sight but even locales with smaller populations experience it. “The study is important for two reasons. First, it is the first time that sky brightness has ever been studied on the continental scale. Second, it shows that existing norms and legislation are failing to reduce sky brightness or even halt its growth,” said physicist Christopher Kyba of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, lead author of the research published in the journal Science. “In the last decade, our understanding of the ecological consequences of light has grown dramatically, as has our understanding and modeling of light in the atmosphere,” Kyba said. A 2017 study based on satellite observations found that Earth’s artificially-lit outdoor surface at night was growing by about 2% annually in brightness and area. This data might represent an underestimate because the global observing satellite currently used is not sensitive to the type of light emitted by modern LED lights, Kyba said. And satellites have a hard time detecting illuminated signs because these shine primarily sideways, not upward, Kyba added. Light pollution has raised concerns about its ecological effects on people and animals. For instance, research has shown how light pollution threatens fireflies, which possess specialized light-emitting organs and flash to communicate as a part of courtship and reproduction. The researchers said more can be done to mitigate light pollution, including better design of the direction, extent and type of lighting used. “It is true that we will never get to a situation where there is no sky brightness over cities. But it is entirely reasonable to imagine that with excellent design, the Milky Way could be visible over cities with even a few hundred thousand inhabitants,” Kyba said. “On the best nights, I have been able to see faint traces of the Milky Way at my home near the center of Potsdam, Germany, with a population about 180,000. If all of the poorly directed lights in Potsdam were replaced by more effective ones, the level of skyglow would be drastically reduced, and the Milky Way would be more generally visible,” Kyba added. Bright starlight now seems confined on land surfaces to remote locales where tourists might venture and less developed regions. “For nearly the entire evolutionary history of life on this planet, the night sky was lit by starlight, moonlight and natural airglow. Until about 150 years ago, to step outside at night was to be confronted with the cosmos,” Kyba said. “Who could say what the cultural and religious impact is when a formerly universal human experience becomes something that only extremely rich or extremely poor people experience?” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/bureau-corrections-personnel-file-criminal-complaints-bantag-others-torture/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gerald Bantag faces new set of criminal complaints – this time, filed by his own subordinates from the corrections bureau on Friday, January 20. In a complaint filed before the Department of Justice (DOJ), six BuCor personnel from Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm in Palawan, alleged that Bantag abused them, while the suspended chief was still the head of BuCor. The respondents were: Lazaro Rafols Jr., Jer Sahid Mojado, Eddie Jimenez Jr., Richie Canja, Roy Gacasa, and Asher Labrador – all corrections officer. Meanwhile, those named respondents in the case included Bantag, former BuCor spokesperson Gabriel Chaclag, former superintendent Ricardo Zulueta, and eight others. Zulueta and Bantag are also involved in the death of Percy Lapid and Jun Villamor, the alleged middleman who contacted people to kill Lapid. The complaint stated that Bantag and other respondents allegedly committed the following violations against the BuCor personnel: Mauricio Ulep, one of BuCor’s legal consultants, said the complaint stemmed from the alleged physical abuse of Bantag against the corrections officers. According to Ulep, the corrections officers were accused by Bantag’s staff – all from the BJMP – of exposing their asset in a drug operation. Afterwards, the corrections officers and Bantag’s staff had a confrontation, where the complainants were physically abused by the BJMP staff on March 1, 2020. The next day, the corrections officers were summoned by Bantag in New Bilibid Prison, where they were also allegedly abused by the suspended BuCor chief. Canja, one of the complainants, said Bantag even pointed a knife at him. “Personal na si General Bantag ang nambugbog sa mga complainants, lahat sila. Na in the presence of Chaclag and Zulueta at ‘yong mga nine na ibang respondents,” Ulep said. “Doon sa medical certificate, may mga bruises, may mga contusions, may mga black eye, gano’n.” (Bantag personally assaulted the complainants – all of them – in Chaclag and Zulueta’s presence, and nine other respondents. The medical certificate stated there were bruises, contusions, and black eye.) In their complaint, the BuCor personnel attached a medical certificate enumerating the injuries Canja sustained when he was abused in Palawan. Canja added that Bantag even threatened to go after their families. “Okay lang sana kung kami ‘yon pero kung isama pa ‘yong pamilya namin. Sasabihin nila pa sa amin na, ‘put*** i** ‘nyo, gusto ‘nyo pagdudukutin ko pa ‘yong mga pamilya ninyo at ‘yong mga asawa ‘nyo babarurutin ko sa harapan ‘nyo?‘,” Canja said. (It’s alright if we were the only ones who will be affected, but they also threatened our families. He [Bantag] cursed us and told us he would abduct our families and molest our wives in front of us.) This is the second torture complaint filed against Bantag after Bilibid gang leaders filed complaints last week. The gang leaders alleged that Bantag stabbed them in February last year. Bantag also faces a long list of complaints and controversies in relation to his time as corrections chief. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-alex-gonzaga-virtue-signaling/,[],"We’ve seen it before. We’ve seen it again. And we’ll definitely see it again one day soon. Such is the pattern of virtue signaling. For those who don’t know it, virtue signaling is the “attempt to show other people that you are a good person.” This may come in many forms, including wearing statement shirts, denouncing racism online, and, yes, quoting the Bible. The last one is common as it’s arguably effective. In a country like the Philippines, to be religious (or appear so) is in itself a virtue. Case in point: Always nice to introduce a devout boyfriend to your parents (#GodsBest and #TrueLoveWaits). Make no mistake. Virtue signaling is a derogatory phrase. You typically use it to describe someone you believe is only grandstanding. A hypocrite, in other words, who does it for clout. To be fair, none of us can fully know a person’s underlying motives. If we’re honest about it, we sometimes find it difficult to explain even our own behavior. As an empirical discipline, sociology restrains me from making any authoritative statement about one’s “true” motives. One can’t simply know. But this does not stop us from reflecting on virtue signaling, especially if expressed in the Christianese language. I say this because religion is consequential. While faith may indeed drive people to do what’s right, it’s also convenient to deflect one’s moral responsibility. In other words, invoking God or citing a heartwarming verse may show that you’re a good person. But like any other form of virtue signaling, it may also be a convenient excuse to not do anything else. The woman of the hour is of course Alex Gonzaga. On her birthday she made fun of a waiter. But like all good things, her fun came to an end. Immediately so. After earning people’s ire on social media, so much damage control had to be done. The plot was so thick that none of her movies could compare. Some celebrities first came to her rescue. And then it was her friends. And then some influencers. And then the husband too. She also had to see Kuya Allan (the waiter), who, for some strange reason, had to sign a note that all is well that ends well. And right when all of it was proving to be hopeless, Alex broke her silence. In a viral post, Alex offered a confession that surprised no one: “On my birthday, God taught me a hard and important lesson. Humility, kindness and better judgment.” She then apologized to Kuya Allan and her family before concluding, “I will rise from this a wiser and better person.” What caught people’s attention was that it was an apology that revolved around, well, Alex. The statement was ultimately about becoming a better person as a result of this crisis. None of it recognized what exactly went wrong. True enough, when analyzed closely, what happened was multilayered: the power asymmetry between the celebrity and the waiter, the humor at the expense of another person, and the laughter around that made all of it seemingly harmless. This virtue signaling worked. By appealing to God as the one who orchestrated all of it to teach her a lesson, Alex has in effect evaded these fundamental issues. Indeed, for Alex and her many supporters, that God taught her a lesson to be humble and kind was the most beautiful thing that came out of this crisis. In the words of one fan: “We love you Alex…People with full faith in Him don’t easily get disheartened. You said sorry and I think that’s enough…Don’t mind the negative words. You and your God know.” And as a rebuke to Alex’s critics, one turned to John 8:7: “He who is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” Even the husband Mikee Morada’s statement was silent on these issues. “Patuloy man ang mga masasabing hindi maganda patungkol sa iyo at sa atin ay nandito ako para sa iyo. Pero may awa Ang Panginoon, dadating ang oras maghihilom din ang lahat.” Reading these words, one wonders whether Mikee was shifting the blame back to Alex’s critics. But that’s not the most important thing. Instead it’s that he invoked God’s mercy. One of course wonders what form of healing he was thinking of and whether it was also for Kuya Allan. Truth be told, the issue here is not just Alex. What transpired in the past days reveals much about religious life in Philippine society. When all that this crisis boils down to is “God taught me a lesson”, one immediately sees that this Christian worldview is narrow-minded. Always about me, and never about the people I’ve caused so much pain. It’s the tragedy of Christianity as we know it in this country – selfish and self-absorbed. And yet virtue signaling in the Christianese language is effective precisely because it draws on the power of God and the Bible. When God’s mercy and healing are all brought in, the tables are turned in a way that the one who is aggrieved has no other choice but to forgive. To do otherwise is to be hateful and even unchristian. This religious worldview has far-reaching consequences. It cheapens forgiveness and evades justice. The recent elections testifies to this point. Built on a message of unity and healing, BBM’s presidential campaign was at its core deeply religious. Everything about his campaign signaled that he was a good man whose family had been unjustly persecuted since 1986. And yet despite it all, BBM called for forgiveness so that the rest of us could move on. The olive branch had been extended. To reject it was unchristian. This Christianized form of virtue signaling is a narrative that has captivated many Filipinos. We saw it with BBM. We saw it with Alex. And we will see it again very soon. Is there any redemption? For what it’s worth, the recent events surrounding that birthday cake reveal that pushing back does make a difference. Virtue signalling, in other words, may evade so much accountability but it can only do so much in the face of resistance. Reclaiming the place of justice in our public life is one way of doing it. Reacting to Alex’s statement, the theologian Jeanne Peracullo offers a reminder that needs to be repeated again and again: “Apology should come with reparation to make things right.” Wanting to become a better person, in other words, is not good enough. – Rappler.com Jayeel Cornelio, PhD (TOYM 2021) is a sociologist of religion at the Ateneo de Manila University.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/bbc-under-fire-corrected-sexist-jacinda-ardern-resignation-headline/,['RUSSELL KU'],"MANILA, Philippines – Social media users slammed the British Broadcasting Corporation over a “sexist” and “tone-deaf” headline on the resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday, January 19. The initial headline of the news article read “Jacinda Ardern resigns: Can women really have it all?” It has since been changed to “Jacinda Ardern resigns: Departure reveals unique pressures on PM” as of Friday, January 20. A tweet from the BBC News (World) account sharing the original headline was also deleted. Psychiatry doctor Kate Womersley of UK’s National Health Service was among the first to slam the headline, saying it was a “disgrace” in her now-viral tweet. Human Rights Watch associate women’s rights director Heather Barr also reacted to the original title, saying, “The 1950s came by and picked up their headline.” Ardern announced her shocking resignation on Thursday, saying she had “no more left in the tank” and would step down no later than early February. She will also not seek reelection in the upcoming general election on October 14. Ardern was thrown into the international spotlight as she became the world’s youngest female head of government at age 37 and was praised for her empathetic leadership style and her country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. International Center for Journalists Global Director of Research Julie Posetti questioned how the culture in the BBC allowed the headline to be produced and published despite the later correction. Other users said that the headline showed “absurd misogyny” from the BBC which should have “not been approved in the first place.” American human rights lawyer and author Qasim Rashid compared the headline to BBC’s coverage of former British prime minister Boris Johnson’s resignation following a series of scandals. During her more than five years as New Zealand prime minister, Ardern has been thrown sexist comments and questions over her leadership and her raising a child while in office. Ardern went viral for dismissing suggestions that she met with Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Martin due to them being of similar age and other “common stuff” during a joint press conference in November. “I wonder whether or not anyone ever asked Barack Obama and John Key if they met because they were of similar age,” she said at the time. Ardern said during her resignation speech that becoming prime minister has the “responsibility to know when you are the right person to lead, and also, when you are not.” “I hope in return I leave behind a belief that you can be kind, but strong. Empathetic, but decisive. Optimistic, but focused,” she added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/ronaldo-messi-roll-back-years-nine-goal-thriller-january-2023/,[],"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi transported fans back in time to the heyday of their storied rivalry, as both superstar forwards got on the scoresheet in an exhibition match on Thursday, January 19, before Hugo Ekitike earned 10-man PSG a 5-4 win over the Riyadh Season Team. While the match may not have much significance for the teams involved, soccer fans around the world got plenty of bang for their buck as a story that has dominated the sport for over a decade appeared to come to an end in a memorable goalfest. In an action-packed first half at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, goals from Messi and Marquinhos were cancelled out by a Ronaldo brace, while PSG’s Juan Bernat was sent off for a lunging tackle on Saudi international Salem Al-Dawsari. Both teams kept their foot on the gas in the second half, but Ekitike’s 78th-minute strike eventually made the difference on the night. “We saw lots of goals in a magnificent stadium with an incredible atmosphere,” PSG coach Cristophe Galtier said. “This evening, we played in a lively stadium with lots of support. I enjoyed the way that they honored the numerous stars that were on the pitch.” Decked in a new black and gold kit, PSG made a blistering start to the game, racing into the lead in the third minute thanks to a deft finish from Messi. Played through on goal by Neymar, Messi was able to poke the ball past goalkeeper Mohamed Al-Owais, who he last faced in Saudi Arabia’s shock World Cup win over Argentina in November. Despite going behind early, the Riyadh Season Team – a combined Saudi Pro League XI featuring players from Al Nassr and Al Hilal – had numerous chances. Ronaldo was an ever-present threat and won a penalty when goalkeeper Keylor Navas clattered into him. Sporting a bright red bruise on his cheek as a result of the collision, Ronaldo picked himself up to calmly convert the spot kick and level the game. Bernat was shown a red card right after the equalizer, but the Ligue 1 club responded well to going a man down, scoring through defender Marquinhos. Their lead would not last long, as Ronaldo once again leveled the game on the verge of halftime, hammering home a rebound after Sergio Ramos botched a straightforward clearance. The goals continued to come thick and fast after the break, as Ramos turned in a Kylian Mbappe cross before South Korean Jang Hyun-soo replied with a near-post header from a corner to make it 3-3. A handball by Ali Al-Bulaihi gave the visitors a penalty, which was expertly dispatched by Mbappe on the hour. It was Mbappe’s last contribution, as he was taken off shortly after, along with team mates Messi and Neymar, as well as Ronaldo. Ekitike then extended PSG’s lead to 5-3 with a thumping finish following a lung-busting run from the halfway line before Anderson Talisca scored a late consolation goal for the Saudis in added time. Though he was unable to get his newest chapter in Saudi Arabia off to a winning start, 37-year-old Ronaldo will take heart from his performance as he prepares to make his first competitive appearance for Al Nassr when they host Al Ettifaq on Sunday. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/pnp-apology-imee-marcos-accuses-police-harassing-onion-farmers-january-2023/,[],"Trigger warning: This article contains references to suicide. MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine National Police (PNP) has apologized after Senator Imee Marcos revealed that policemen had repeatedly visited an onion farmer who testified in a Senate hearing on Monday, January 16. “Hands off lang po sa mga testigo ng Senado! Natatakot na ang mga magsasaka ng sibuyas sa biglaang pagkakatok ng pulis kagabi hanggang ngayong umaga upang papirmahin ng sinumpaang salaysay na nagbabaliktad sa kanilang ibinunyag sa Senado nung Martes,” Marcos said in a statement on Thursday, January 19. (Hands off Senate witnesses! Onion farmers are now scared after police suddenly came knocking last night until this morning, asking to sign a sworn statement recanting their Senate testimony on Tuesday.) Marcos said the harassment of onion farmer and Senate witness Merly Gallardo was prompted by an order from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). “Utos raw ng DILG at ng NTF-ELCAC: CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines – New People’s Army) ba ang turing natin sa maliliit na magsasaka sa liblib?” the senator said. (It was supposedly ordered by the DILG and NTF-ELCAC: do we treat farmers in remote areas as CPP-NPA? During Monday’s hearing, Merlita “Merly” Gallardo told the Senate that her husband took his own life in 2021 after an armyworm infestation and a series of bad weather incidents repeatedly destroyed their crops. Four other farmers in Bayambang, Pangasinan also allegedly committed suicide amid the miserable state of agriculture. In the days following the hearing, Gallardo said that uniformed PNP personnel went to her home eight times in a span of two days, with the latest visit stretching past 11 pm. “Natakot ako kasi pabalik-balik. Aburido na ako,” Gallardo said in a DZBB interview on Friday, January 20. (I was scared because they kept coming back. I was worried.) During the visits, they conducted an interview with Gallardo and also asked her to sign a statement recanting her Senate testimony. Gallardo refused to sign the documents, adding that she did not understand them. “‘Yung sinumpaang salaysay po sir, ‘yung number 9, nakalagay doon parang nirerecant ni nanay ‘yung mga paunang statement niya sa Senado,” Elvin Laceda, national president of Young Farmers Challenge Club of the Philippines, said in the DZBB interview. (In the statement, in number 9, it’s stated there that it’s as if she is recanting her earlier statement in the Senate.) The cops also prepared an affidavit on the death of her husband, which Laceda also questioned. “Bakit nila gustong baguhin yung cause of death? Tapos na, settled na ‘yun e. Okay na sila nanay. Wala silang nirereklamo. Wala silang sinampang kaso. So, ang tanong namin: bakit kailangang isang affidavit?” he said. (Why do they want to change the cause of death? It’s settled already. She’s already okay. They did not file any complaint. They’re not filing cases. So, we ask: why do they need an affidavit?) Laceda said that Gallardo’s husband was a barangay official, so it’s unlikely that the barangay had no record of his death. However, it’s possible that Gallardo failed to report her husband’s death to the PNP since he died when community quarantine restrictions were at its peak. PNP Public Information Office (PIO) chief Police Colonel Redrico Maranan apologized for the incident, stating that it was not the intention of the police to incite fear. “Ang PNP po ay unang-una humihingi ng paumanhin po sa’yo at sa iyong mga pamilya kung ‘yung amin pong ginawa ay nagdulot sa inyo ng pangamba at takot,” Maranan said in the DZBB interview. (The PNP, first of all, asks for you and your family’s forgiveness if what we did caused worry and fear.) “Sana po ay kayo’y magkaroon ng pagtitiwala po sa ating kapulisan sapagka’t po ay ginagawa lamang ang aming trabaho. Pumunta po diyan yung pulis, wala pong masamang intensyon,” he added. (We hope that you may once again trust our police, given that they were just doing our job. The police went there with no ill intentions.) Maranan said that officers conducted multiple visits because the initial statements were taken by hand, which then had to be encoded in a computer. The statements underwent multiple revisions, requiring them to repeatedly return to Gallardo’s home. He further clarified that police officers, who had coordinated with barangay officials, conducted the visits on orders from the DILG. The agency had asked the police to investigate the alleged spate of suicides in Bayambang, Pangasinan, which were raised during Gallardo’s testimony at the Senate. “Ito po ay nagsimula noong ang ating chief of police ay makatanggap po ng isang liham galing po ng DILG, at ang sinasaad po ng liham ay dahil doon sa isang news report ng isang radio network na nagkaroon ng limang suicide incidents sa Bayambang sa kadahilanan na sa sibuyas, doon sa pagkalugi sa sibuyas,” he said. (This started when our chief of police received a letter from the DILG, and the letter was regarding a news report from a radio network about the five suicide incidents in Bayambang related to how onion farmers faced big losses.) The DILG had instructed the PNP to conduct “validation” on the claim of five suicides in the barangay, Maranan said. He added that in 2021, contrary to what was reported, only one farmer took his own life. Maranan also said that Gallardo’s husband died to “respiratory failure secondary to organic phosphate poisoning.” It is believed that he poisoned himself after his debts climbed to P1.7 million. Organic phosphate is an extremely toxic insecticide. “Dahil doon, hindi siya makabayad, at parang nahihiya siya. ‘Yun po ang nangyari,” he said. (Because of this, he could not pay, and he felt ashamed. That’s what happened.) With the imminent arrival of cheap onion imports threatening to drive onion prices even lower, senators and farmers’ groups worry that onion farmers may further struggle to make ends meet. – Rappler.com The Department of Health, through the National Center for Mental Health, has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-results-andy-murray-thanasi-kokkinakis-january-20-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Andy Murray said tennis must look at avoiding late-night finishes after completing a remarkable Australian Open victory over Thanasi Kokkinakis at 4.05 am on Friday morning, January 20. The former world No. 1 battled back from two sets and 2-5 down to claim a remarkable 4-6, 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 6-3, 7-5 victory and move into the third round. At 5 hours and 45 minutes, it was the longest match of the 35-year-old’s career and while he applauded the crowd for staying so late on Margaret Court Arena, he said playing matches in the small hours was farcical. It was not quite the latest finish at the Australian Open, that being the clash between Leyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis which ended at 4.34 am in 2008. But Murray said the scheduling must be looked at. “Finishing at 4 am isn’t ideal. Because I don’t know who it’s beneficial for. A match like that, and we come here after the match and we’re discussing the time rather than it being like epic Murray-Kokkinakis match, it ends in a bit of a farce,” the Briton said. “Amazingly people stayed until the end. I really appreciate people doing that, creating an atmosphere for us at the end. “Some people need to work the following day and everything. If my child was a ball kid for a tournament, they’re coming home at five in the morning, as a parent, I’m snapping at that. “It’s not beneficial for them. It’s not beneficial for the umpires, the officials. I don’t think it’s amazing for the fans. It’s not good for the players.” Murray, who incredibly looked the fresher at the end despite playing with a partly metal hip and being 10 years older than his opponent, said the slow conditions did not help. “The courts are not slow. But the balls, when we started tonight, it felt like there was no pressure in the balls, like flat almost. That was what I was complaining about,” he said. “It’s just difficult to hit winners once you’re in the rallies. You’ve seen it. I think there was a 70-shot rally yesterday, multiple 35-45 shot rallies, which is not normal. Yeah, probably need to look at that.” Five-time runner-up Murray, who knocked out fancied Italian Matteo Berrettini in round one in another five-set marathon, has already spent nearly 11 hours on court. He will face Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, the man he lost to in 2019 when his career seemed over, on Saturday when he will hope to get an early slot and perhaps avoid another marathon. Murray looked down and out against an inspired Kokkinakis as he trailed by two sets and 2-5 but displayed his trademark warrior spirit to somehow claw out. When the 35-year-old Scot finally got the job done in what was the 250th and longest Grand Slam match of his career, the clock was showing 4.05 am local time but a sizable and vociferous crowd had remained glued to their seats in the Margaret Court Arena. It was another stupendous effort from the three-time Grand Slam champion whose career has been littered by such battles and who has stubbornly refused to call it a day since having a partly metal hip inserted in 2019. Bizarrely he will now play Agut, the man who beat him at the 2019 Australian Open, after which Murray was given an emotional on-court tribute with his career apparently over because of his crumbling hip. Four years later, a period during which he has often struggled for form and results, Murray retains his insatiable appetite for a battle and while it felt absurd to be watching elite sport at such an hour, Murray cared not a jot. “It’s unbelievable how I managed to turn that around because Thanasi was serving unbelievable and hitting his forehand huge,” world No. 66 Murray, who now has won a record 11 Grand Slam matches from two sets down, said on court. “Yeah, I have a big heart. I rely on my love and my drive and my respect for the game, that’s why I kept going.” Murray, back with coach Ivan Lendl who guided him to his Grand Slam titles and to world No. 1 in 2016, has not gone past the third round of a Grand Slam since 2017 when his hip condition first surfaced. After stunning  Berrettini in round one in a match lasting almost five hours, a rejuvenated Murray was favorite against Kokkinakis, a player who once looked destined for the top but who has been plagued by injuries. But the 26-year-old Kokkinakis came out firing, dominating the opening two sets with the kind of aggressive tennis and ball-striking that made a mockery of his world ranking of 159. Kokkinakis, who thumped 102 winners during the scrap, briefly lost his focus when leading by a break early in the third set, arguing with the umpire over a time violation and destroying a racket after losing a point in which Murray retrieved three successive smashes. But when he surged into a 5-2 lead, he was on the verge of his biggest career win. Murray, however, would not go away. Kokkinakis tightened with the finishing line in sight and the venom gradually went out of his shots as Murray threw caution to the wind and locked on to his target. Relentlessly Murray ground his way back into the contest to set up a deciding fifth set, sealing the fourth set with a second-serve ace. A weary-looking Kokkinakis did not capitulate and the raucous atmosphere inside the stadium revived him early in set five as he kept his nose in front. There was pandemonium when he saved four break points at 3-3 and Kokkinakis was within two points of victory when Murray served at 4-5 in the decider. But Murray’s greater experience of such duels enabled him to get the crucial break of serve in the following game with a stunning forehand winner before sealing victory in the next game on his first match point with a clinical backhand. With so many seeds out in the bottom half, Murray has a genuine shot at a deep run, although after nearly 11 hours on court so far, recovery was the only thing on his mind. “Thanks for staying, but now I think we should all get off to bed,” Murray said. – Rappler.com"

Ardern, 42, said Thursday she had “no more in the tank” to continue leading the country, and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election. Her party, Labour, has been struggling in the polls, with a Taxpayers’ Union-Curia poll released Friday using research from before Ardern announcement saw Labour’s popularity fall to 31.7%, while the opposition New Zealand National Party saw support from 37.2% of respondents. There is no clear successor to Ardern and commentators point to several ministers as possible candidates for the role, including Chris Hipkins, the former COVID minister and current Minister of Education and Police, and current Minister of Justice Kiri Allen and Minister of Transport Michael Wood. Hipkins told news organization Newshub on Friday that he expected Labour lawmakers to reach consensus on a new candidate, but declined to say whether he planned to run. “We do have a responsibility to make sure that we’re making these decisions in the best interests of New Zealanders,” he said. Ardern told media at Napier Airport on Friday that she intended to remain neutral during the election. “I think the most important thing is that we focus on the process,” she said. Local media have reported that Megan Woods, minister of housing, ruled herself out of contention. If a candidate is unable to secure two-thirds of the available votes on Sunday, the leadership contest will go to the wider membership. Labour’s chief whip, Duncan Webb, said in a statement that to be nominated a candidate must have the support of at least seven lawmakers, and that their nomination must be received before the deadline. “Caucus (the 64 Labour lawmakers in parliament) had seven days from the date of resignation to reach a decision. Accordingly Caucus can continue to meet to seek to obtain 66% support for a leader up until that time,” Webb said. The winner will become prime minister until the next general election. Ardern’s term as leader will conclude no later than February 7 and a general election will be held on October 14. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/ted-te-says-de-lima-can-lobby-release-supreme-court-test-after-gigi-reyes/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Detained former senator Leila de Lima can ask the Supreme Court (SC) for her temporary liberty, following the High Court’s ruling which granted Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes her temporary release from jail, according to former SC spokesperson Theodore “Ted” Te. “Since the January 17, 2023 Resolution in GR No. 254838 (1st Div) creating a WRIT OF INTERIM HABEAS CORPUS is not designated as one that applies pro hac vice (only in this instance), Leila De Lima should file a petition for HC tomorrow as a test,” Te said. Reyes, former chief of staff of presidential legal counsel Juan Ponce Enrile, was released from jail on Thursday, January 19, after the SC granted her the privilege of writ of habeas corpus. Reyes had been in jail since 2014 after she was slapped by the Office of the Ombudsman with graft and plunder charges. The SC ruled that Reyes was granted the extraordinary writ because her constitutional right to speedy trial was infringed, and her detention had “become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty.” Because of the ruling, a new remedy for temporary release became available, Te explained. The “interim” writ of habeas corpus – as Te calls it – is similar, but not exactly like bail. Traditionally, the extraordinary writ is used to challenge the detention of a person, lobby their release, and “to inquire into the cause of detention of a person.” “The SC did not expressly say the Rule on Habeas Corpus is amended but with the issuance of Guidelines pursuant to the Court’s rule-making power, it may be reasonably understood that the Rule has been modified,” Te told Rappler. The legal remedy also “widened the space and opportunities” for others similarly accused, especially those whose bail is discretionary and “whose rights to speedy trial are violated,” Te said. The “unforeseen consequence” of the ruling on Reyes is that other applicants will seek the same privilege from the High Court, he added. “The consequence of this new interim writ is that all those similarly situated to the applicant under the Guidelines will now file petitions with the SC. Hopefully, it will not become an opportunity to narrow the scope of the interim writ’s application,” Te said. De Lima has been detained for almost six years – since 2017 – for drug charges. The cases stem from accusations that she ran a drug trade in the Philippines’ main national penitentiary, New Bilibid Prison, to fund her successful 2016 senatorial campaign. Aside from being acquitted from one of three drug charges against her, the prosecution’s star witness, Rafael Ragos, recanted his statement and said he was only forced to lie. Alleged drug lord Kerwin Espinosa also cleared De Lima from the accusations, adding that he was also coerced. The SC ruling on the Reyes case made it clear that there are now at least three types of writ of habeas corpus that can be invoked: pre-charge, post-conviction, and interim (Reyes case), Te explained. He added that the ruling also differentiated the “interim” writ of habeas corpus from the two instances when interim bail was granted. “Interim bail” means bail is discretionary. “Interim bail 1 (affidavits presented hearsay, as found by the SC pre-arraignment), interim bail 2 (health condition) both involved the same applicant,” the human rights lawyer said. Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla shared the same position with Te. “The same reasoning may apply to Sen. De Lima’s case,” Remulla told reporters. But former DOJ chief and now Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said the ruling will be applied on a “case-to-case basis.” “I believe that the court’s ruling in this case will have to be applied on a case-to-case basis, depending on the facts of each particular case, and not as blanket precedent.” Guevarra added that the Office of the Solicitor General will study the ramifications of the SC ruling. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/whales-gigantism-genes-study/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The blue, fin, bowhead, gray, humpback, right and sperm whales are the largest animals alive today. In fact, the blue whale is the largest-known creature ever on Earth, topping even the biggest of the dinosaurs. How did these magnificent marine mammals get so big? A new study explored the genetic underpinnings of gigantism in whales, identifying four genes that appear to have played crucial roles. These genes, the researchers said, helped in fostering great size but also in mitigating related disadvantageous consequences including higher cancer risk and lower reproductive output. Cetaceans, the marine mammal group encompassing whales, dolphins and porpoises, evolved around 50 million years ago from vaguely wolf-like land-based ancestors that belonged to a mammalian assemblage called artiodactyls that includes today’s cows, pigs, sheep and many others. “Body size is a complex result of many genes, pathways, and physical and ecological processes,” said geneticist Mariana Nery of Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil, co-author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. “Our results are among the first to study gigantism in cetaceans from a molecular perspective.” The study focused on seven whale species exceeding 33 feet (10 meters) long. Six are baleen whales, which consume tiny prey using a mouth filter-feeding system involving baleen plates made of the same substance found in people’s fingernails. The sperm whale is a toothed whale that hunts large prey like giant squid. Blue whales can reach about 100 feet (30 meters) long, fin whales about 80 feet (24 meters), sperm and bowhead whales about 60 feet (18 meters), humpback and right whales about 50 feet (15 meters) and gray whales about 45 feet (13.5 meters). After assessing nine genes including some associated with increased body size in other mammals, the researchers found that four – named GHSR, IGFBP7, NCAPG and PLAG1 – appear to have gained prominence during the evolution of large whales. GHSR is a gene involved in releasing growth hormone through the pituitary gland, body weight, energy metabolism, appetite and fat accumulation. It also is associated with controlling cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Tumors essentially are formed by runaway cell growth. IGFBP7 is a gene involved in promoting cell growth and division. There is evidence it acts as a cancer suppressor in prostate, breast, lung and colorectal tumors. NCAPG, a gene associated with growth in people, horses, donkeys, cattle, pigs and chickens, is linked to increased body size, weight gain, cell proliferation and cell life cycles. PLAG1, a gene associated with body growth in cattle, pigs, and sheep, is involved in embryo growth and cell survival. “Gigantism in the current cetacean lineage is recent, estimated at approximately 5 million years ago. Before that, there were animals with large sizes, like Basilosaurus, but these were exceptions, and most cetaceans did not exceed 10 meters in length,” said study lead author Felipe Andre Silva, who worked on the research while earning his master’s degree in genetics and molecular biology at UNICAMP. “Gigantism may bring some advantages such as a lower chance of being preyed upon and a greater chance of obtaining food,” Silva added. Basilosaurus, a toothed apex predator from about 40 million years ago, was the largest-known early whale. The baleen whale lineage dates to roughly 36 million years ago, starting modest in size. “The evolution of cetaceans is a fantastic story, as these huge and charismatic animals attract the attention of many people,” Nery said. “But beyond the curiosity it arouses, these animals can teach us a lot about the evolutionary process itself. And whales have proven to be a very interesting model to understand how biodiversity is generated and help answer fundamental questions in evolutionary biology.” – Rappler.com"

US District Judge John Middlebrooks, who threw out Trump’s lawsuit in September, said the sanctions were warranted because the former president had exhibited a pattern of misusing the courts to further his political agenda. “This case should never have been brought. Its inadequacy as a legal claim was evident from the start. No reasonable lawyer would have filed it. Intended for a political purpose, none of the counts of the amended complaint stated a cognizable legal claim,” Middlebrooks wrote in the 45-page written ruling. Representatives for Trump and his lead attorney in the case, Alina Habba, could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Thursday evening. Trump sued Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, claiming that she and other Democrats sought to rig that election by falsely accusing his campaign of links to Russia.

Al Horford added 20 points and 10 rebounds for Boston, which outscored Golden State, 15-12, in OT to extend its winning streak to eight games. Marcus Smart (18), Jaylen Brown (16), Robert Williams (14), and Malcolm Brogdon (14) also scored in double figures. Williams added 11 rebounds for Boston, the league-leaders with a 34-12 record. Steph Curry had 29 points and 7 assists for Golden State, which won last year’s title by beating Boston in six games. Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole each tossed in 24 points and Andrew Wiggins scored 20 for the Warriors, who received 11 points, 13 rebounds, and 9 assists from Draymond Green. Brown returned to action after missing Boston’s last three games because of groin tightness and made a three-pointer that tied the game at 106-106 with 18.1 seconds remaining in regulation. Until that point Boston had trailed throughout the second half. The game went to overtime after Curry missed a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds on the clock, and, following a timeout, Brown’s three-point attempt at the buzzer was off the mark. An 8-0 run gave the Celtics a 118-111 lead in the extra period. Golden State had a chance to force a second overtime, but Poole missed a half-court shot at the buzzer. Golden State had a 26-25 lead after one quarter and led 55-54 at halftime thanks to a half-court shot from Curry that beat the first-half buzzer. The Celtics outscored the Warriors 13-2 at the start of the second to take a 10-point lead – the largest lead in the half. Tatum (3-for-11 from the field) and Brown (1-for-6) were limited to 16 points in the first half. Golden State increased its lead to 89-82 by outscoring Boston, 34-28, in the third. The Warriors had an 11-point lead (85-74) following two Curry free throws with 2:12 left in the quarter. It was the second meeting between the teams this season.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/no-signs-missing-actor-julian-sands-january-19-2023/,[],"LOS ANGELES, USA – The search for British-born film star Julian Sands, best known for his role in A Room with a View, pressed on for a sixth day in the snow-covered mountains of Southern California with no sign of the 65-year-old actor, authorities said on Thursday, January 19. The performer was reported missing on Friday evening, January 13, after he had gone hiking alone in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Los Angeles, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. A search was immediately initiated in the area, but ground teams were pulled out on Saturday evening due to avalanche risks and poor trail conditions, said the sheriff’s department spokesperson Mara Rodriguez. Intermittent aerial searches by helicopter and drone aircraft have continued, however, and authorities planned to resume a ground search once conditions allow, she said. “We had an air crew up today and there were no signs of Mr. Sands,” Rodriguez told Reuters by email. The Baldy Bowl, a large sloping area below the crest of the Mount Baldy ski area, is a popular destination for skiers, climbers, and backpackers. And Rodriguez said Sands was believed to be an experienced hiker. Cellphone signals detected on Sunday, January 15, showed Sands was then heading to the Mount Baldy area, apparently the latest indication he was still on the move. Subsequent attempts to “ping” his Apple iPhone failed, “due to the lack of cell service and most likely cell phone power failure,” the department said in an update posted on Thursday. A “delayed ping” from Sands’ iPhone operating system, generated on January 14, provided a possible location on a trail to the Mount Baldy summit, but checks of that spot by ground and helicopter teams were of no avail, the department said. The Sheriff’s Department has warned that severe winter weather, following weeks of storms that dumped heavy snow in California mountains, has made the Baldy area dangerous for outdoor recreation. Overnight temperatures there have ranged from the low-40s to the mid-20s Fahrenheit (4 to minus 4 degrees Celsius) over the past week, Rodriguez said. Over the past four weeks, sheriff search teams have been dispatched on 14 rescue missions on Mount Baldy and surrounding areas for lost or stranded hikers, two of whom perished after falling or injuring themselves, the agency said. Sands’ Los Angeles-based representative could not immediately be reached for comment. Born in England, Sands moved to California in the 1980s to pursue a Hollywood career after the success of the 1985 film A Room with a View, a period romance in which he was cast as the leading man opposite Helena Bonham Carter. He also starred as the son of Satan in the 1989 supernatural thriller Warlock and its sequel Warlock: The Armageddon. He played the title role in the 1998 film version of The Phantom of the Opera, and starred opposite martial-arts performer Jackie Chan in the 2003 action-comedy The Medallion. Other motion picture credits include The Killing Fields, Arachnophobia, Naked Lunch, Boxing Helena, Leaving Las Vegas, and the English-language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/decision-ukraine-tanks-nato-defense-leaders-meeting-january-20-2023/,[],"Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy said his government was expecting “strong decisions” from defense leaders of NATO and other countries meeting on Friday, January 20, to discuss boosting Ukraine’s ability to confront Russian forces with modern battle tanks. The meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany is the latest in a series since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago, and where future weapons supplies will be discussed, particularly of Germany’s Leopard 2 tanks used by armies across Europe. Berlin has veto power over any decision to export the tanks and Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government has appeared reluctant so far to authorize that for fear of provoking Russia. Some allies say Berlin’s concern is misplaced, with Russia already fully committed to war, while Moscow has repeatedly said Western weapons transfers would prolong the conflict and increase suffering in Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia have both relied primarily on Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which have been destroyed in their hundreds during the war that Russian President Vladimir Putin started last February 24, calling it a “special military operation” to protect Russia and Russian speakers. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory and to erase the independence of a ex-Soviet republic and neighbor. Western countries have provided a steady supply of weapons to Ukraine. “We are, in fact, now waiting for a decision from one European capital, which will activate the prepared chains of cooperation regarding tanks,” Zelenskiy said in a video address on Thursday night. “We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting tomorrow. We are expecting strong decisions. We are expecting a powerful military aid package from the United States,” he said. The United States on Thursday announced new military assistance for Ukraine valued at up to $2.5 billion, including hundreds of armored vehicles and support for Ukraine’s air defense. The aid includes 59 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 90 Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement. In total, the United States has committed more than $27.4 billion in security aid to Ukraine since the invasion began. German government sources have said Berlin would move on the Leopard tanks issue if Washington agreed to send Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Abrams tanks were not included in Thursday’s announcement by the United States. Germany’s new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said earlier, however, that he did not know of any requirement that Ukraine receive US and German tanks simultaneously. “I’m not aware of any such stipulation,” Pistorius told German ARD television when asked if that meant Abrams and Leopards had to be delivered at the same time, a position that leaves open the possibility of an agreement on Friday. Ukraine’s allies in the West have wanted to avoid NATO appearing to confront Russia directly and demurred on sending the Kyiv government their most potent weaponry. Ukraine needed the tanks to defend itself, recapture occupied land, and did not plan to attack Russia, Zelenskiy told ARD television on Thursday. “From Washington to London, from Paris to Warsaw, you hear one thing: Ukraine needs tanks. Tanks are the key to ending the war properly. It is time to stop trembling before Putin and take the final step,” tweeted Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. Meanwhile, CIA Director William Burns traveled in secret to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy, a US official told Reuters on Thursday. The official declined to say when the visit took place. The Washington Post, which first reported the visit, said it took place at the end of last week. The Post said Burns briefed Zelenskiy on his expectations on Russia’s military plans. Fighting continued to be most intense in the strategic industrial region known as the Donbas on Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia, Ukrainian military officials said on Thursday night. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russian forces shelled the town of Bakhmut, Russia’s main target in Donetsk province, which combined with Luhansk province forms the Donbas. Soledar, about 20 km (12 miles) from Bakhmut, also came under fire – Russian forces say they control Soledar, while Ukrainian sources say their military is still fighting in Soledar. “Ukrainian forces have practically stabilized the front around Bakhmut,” Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said on YouTube. “As of today, Russia is turning Soledar into a military hub. And they are trying to redirect troops towards the towns of Spirne and Bilohorivka – just inside the Luhansk region.” Reuters was not able to verify battlefield reports. – Rappler.com"

Speaking to media after meeting with relevant ministers, Kishida said he had instructed them to consider the specific requirements for a reclassification that would put COVID-19 in the same category as seasonal flu. “As we try to restore the lifestyles of a normal Japan, we would like to shift various measures step by step,” Kishida told reporters. A classification downgrade to disease category five from the current category two would end an isolation requirement for infected people and their close contacts. In a separate measure foreshadowed by Kishida, the government would also advise only patients with symptoms to wear masks in indoor public places, whereas currently it urges everyone to do so. The government last revised coronavirus measures in May. It said then that people no longer had to wear masks when outside as long as appropriate social distance was maintained. Even so, the vast majority of people in Japan are still wearing masks in public, both outdoors and indoors. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/alec-baldwin-to-be-charged-involuntary-manslaughter-rust-film-shooting/,[],"TAOS, New Mexico – American actor Alec Baldwin faces involuntary manslaughter charges carrying prison time in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during the 2021 filming of Western Rust in New Mexico. Santa Fe’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, said on Thursday, January 19 that the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, would also be charged with involuntary manslaughter. She said charges would be filed by the end of this month. Hutchins’ family welcomed the announcement, while Baldwin attorney Luke Nikas said, “this decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice.” The charging decision followed more than a year of investigation after a pistol was fired in October 2021 as Baldwin, 64, was rehearsing with it on the set of his movie Rust outside Santa Fe. The movie’s director, Joel Souza, was hit and wounded by the same .45-caliber bullet that killed Hutchins. According to a police report, David Halls, the assistant director who handed the gun to Baldwin, told the actor it was “cold,” an industry term meaning it did not contain blank rounds. Halls signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, Carmack-Altwies said in her statement. Gutierrez-Reed had handled the gun before Halls. Prosecutors told the New York Times it was part of industry standards for actors to check that firearms they used were safe to handle and to follow a basic gun safety practice of never pointing them at anyone. Baldwin has pushed back at that idea, saying firearm safety was the responsibility of the armorer and first director and that he was directed to aim the pistol at the cinematographer. “You should not point a gun at someone that you’re not willing to shoot,” Carmack-Altwies said in an interview with the Times on Thursday. Prosecutors could face long odds securing a conviction, according to legal experts, who said that if on-set professionals told Baldwin the gun did not contain live ammunition, he wouldn’t be obligated to inspect it himself. “It’s a very aggressive charging decision, and the defense has a strong case,” said personal injury attorney and former prosecutor Neama Rahmani, who was not involved in the Rust case. “Accidents like this are not enough for criminal liability.” Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be charged “in the alternative” with two counts of manslaughter, meaning a jury will decide not only if they were guilty, but under which definition of involuntary manslaughter, the prosecutor said. Simple involuntary manslaughter for negligence is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Should prosecutors prove there was more than simple negligence involved in the use of a firearm, they could face a mandatory five-year jail term. Baldwin has denied responsibility for Hutchins’ death and said he did not pull the trigger of the replica Pietta .45-caliber long Colt revolver. An FBI forensic test of the revolver found it “functioned normally” and would not fire without the trigger being pulled. “Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun — or anywhere on the movie set. He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We will fight these charges, and we will win,” his attorney Nikas said. Firearms guidance from SAG-AFTRA, a union representing US film and television actors, instructs artists to treat firearms as though they are loaded with blanks and recommends consulting a safety handler before pointing a gun at someone on camera, and never placing a finger on a trigger unless ready to shoot. The guide reminds actors that blank ammunition can kill and live ammunition is never to be brought onto a film set. The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office investigation did not reveal how live ammunition got onto the Rust set. Brian Panish, a lawyer representing the Hutchins family, said his own investigation found charges were warranted. The family sued Baldwin in 2021, alleging the Emmy-winning 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live actor had a responsibility to check that the gun did not contain blank rounds, to not cock the weapon and to not point it at Hutchins and pull the trigger. The family subsequently reached a settlement in which Matt Hutchins became an executive producer of Rust. Production was set to resume early in 2023 outside New Mexico. New Mexico’s worker safety agency in April fined the film’s production company $137,000, the maximum amount possible, for what it described as “willful” safety lapses leading to Hutchins’ death. Hours before the incident, camera operators walked off the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch, south of Santa Fe, protesting what they saw as poor set safety and working conditions. Lawyer Duncan Levin said the case revolved around ill-defined film industry firearm safety standards and seemed more a question of civil law than a criminal case. “Prosecutors have a lot of work ahead of them to demonstrate that putting Alec Baldwin in prison for this is the right outcome,” said Levin, who has represented actors and entertainment personalities. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-covid-outbreak-easing-eve-travel-rush-2023/,[],"BEIJING, China – China said the worst was over in its battle against COVID-19 ahead of what is expected to be the busiest day of travel in years on Friday, January 20, a mass movement of people that has fed fears of a further surge in infections. Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees China’s virus response, said that the outbreak was at a “relatively low” level, state media reported late on Thursday, January 18, after health officials said the number of COVID patients in clinics, emergency rooms and with critical conditions had peaked. But there are widespread doubts about China’s account of an outbreak that has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums since Beijing abandoned strict COVID controls and mass testing last month and unleashed the virus on its 1.4 billion population after protests against the anti-COVID policy. Some health experts expect more than one million people will die from the disease in China this year, with British-based health data firm Airfinity forecasting COVID fatalities could hit 36,000 a day next week. “Recently, the overall pandemic in the country is at a relatively low level,” Sun said in comments reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency. “The number of critical patients at hospitals is decreasing steadily, though the rescue mission is still heavy.” Her comments came on the eve of what is expected to be the busiest day of travel across China since the pandemic erupted in late 2019, as millions of city-dwellers travel to home towns for the Lunar New Year holiday that officially begins on Saturday. President Xi Jinping said this week that he was concerned about an influx of travellers to rural areas with weak medical systems, and that protecting the elderly – many of whom are not fully vaccinated – was a top priority. China reported a large jump in COVID-19 hospitalisations in the week through to Jan. 15, to the highest since the pandemic began, according to a report published by the World Health Organization on Thursday. Hospitalizations rose by 70% on the previous week to 63,307, according to the WHO, citing data submitted by Beijing. But in a news conference on Thursday, health officials said the number of COVID patients reporting to hospital had peaked with more than 40% fewer people being treated with critical conditions on January 17 compared with a peak on January 5. China said last Saturday that nearly 60,000 people with COVID had died in hospital between December 8 and January 12 – a roughly 10-fold increase from previous disclosures. However, that number excludes those who died at home, and some doctors in China have said they are discouraged from putting COVID on death certificates. While China’s reopening is proving deadly, investors are hopeful that it will eventually help revive its $17 trillion economy, placing bets that have lifted Chinese stocks and its yuan currency to multi-month highs in recent sessions. “Markets widely anticipate a surge of pent-up demand will be unleashed from the reopening of China’s economy,” Nomura analysts said in a note. The analysts cautioned though that a fall in household wealth and a surge in youth unemployment, a hangover from years of lockdowns, may temper the rebound. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/brazil-launches-anti-deforestation-raids-protect-amazon/,[],"URUARA, Brazil – Brazilian environmental agents cut through the rainforest with machetes on Thursday, January 19, in search of criminals in the first anti-deforestation raids under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has pledged to end surging destruction inherited from his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Reuters exclusively accompanied raids led by environmental agency Ibama in the rainforest state of Para to stop loggers and ranchers illegally clearing the forest. The agency also launched raids this week in the states of Roraima and Acre, Ibama environmental enforcement coordinator Tatiane Leite said. About 10 Ibama agents set out in pickup trucks on Thursday from their base in the municipality of Uruara, Pará, along with a dozen federal police, heading toward a cluster of points where satellite images showed loggers and ranchers recently at work clearing the forest illegally. (READ: Statistic of the decade: The massive deforestation of the Amazon) In 12 hours driving on dirt roads illegally crisscrossing an indigenous reserve, the convoy reached five areas that were deforested and burned around the time of last October’s election that pitted Lula against Bolsonaro. The areas all lay within the Cachoeira Seca indigenous reserve, where deforestation is strictly prohibited. Four of the tracts appeared to be subsequently abandoned, with no signs people were living nearby or in the process of turning them into ranches. Agents said it could be a sign that illegal ranchers gave up on investing time and money in turning illegal land into productive pasture, knowing that Lula campaigned on a pledge to crack down on deforestation. “People know that in this government enforcement will tighten and won’t let them use an area they deforested illegally,” said Givanildo dos Santos Lima, the agent leading Ibama’s Uruara mission. “If the other government had won, you would have found people here, well-maintained pastures and cattle.” The government under Bolsonaro had gutted staff and funding for environmental enforcement by Ibama in his four years in office, while the former president criticized Ibama for issuing fines to farmers and miners. Bolsonaro gave the military and later the Justice Ministry authority over operations to fight deforestation, sidelining Ibama despite the agency’s extensive experience and success in fighting the destruction of the Amazon. An area larger than Denmark was deforested under Bolsonaro, a 60% increase from the prior four years. (READ: Brazil’s Bolsonaro accused of crimes against humanity as Amazon felled) In another area of the reserve, agents found a newly built house with several chainsaws and stocked with weeks of food, indicating the occupants had likely fled just before Ibama’s arrival. Flanked by police with semiautomatic weapons, Ibama agents hacked a path through the adjacent jungle to reach an area the size of 57 football fields strewn with downed trees and charged trunks. Some messily planted corn sprouted up to knee-level in what appeared to be an attempt to lay claim to the area to eventually turn it into cattle pasture, the agents said. “We’ll come back with a helicopter and catch them by surprise,” Lima said. He was optimistic that Ibama would be able to conduct more raids under Lula, aimed at fining deforesters and spooking criminals from attempting to clear more areas. Lula on the campaign trail last year pledged to put Ibama back in charge of combating deforestation with beefed-up funding and personnel. He took office on Jan. 1, so additional money and staff have yet to reach the front-line enforcers. Bolsonaro’s government denied several requests by Reuters to accompany Ibama missions during his 2019-2022 administration. His government instituted a gag order forbidding Ibama agents from speaking to the press, which agents say has already been reversed. Lula took office for the first time in 2003 when Amazon deforestation was near all-time highs, and through strict enforcement of environmental laws reduced it by 72% to a near record low when he left office in 2010. – Rappler.com"

The 2 pm fluvial procession will feature Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) fiber boats, dragon boats, jet skis, yachts, barges, and bancas, with the PCG’s 3503 MV Romblon leading from Fort San Pedro, passing through the Guimaras strait towards the Iloilo River. It ends at Muelle Loney Street where passengers will disembark to join other devotees in a foot procession. The last two Dinagyang festivals were virtual editions due to health protocols imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Committee on Religious Activities chair Robert Alor said in a press conference on Thursday, Jan 19 that the PCG has imposed 50% capacity on 80-passenger fiber boats as a safety measure. The fluvial procession represents the Santo Niño image’s arrival in Cebu. The street procession is a form of penitence and a petition for the success of the festival, Alor said. The Church processions are separate from the secular Dinagyang festival that highlights the myth of Panay island’s indigenous Aetas bartering away land to ten Bornean datus fleeing their homeland’s despotic ruler. Alor said organizers have discouraged children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities and pregnant women from joining the processions to prevent accidents and medical emergencies. “Mainit nga daan and budlay magpila, basi may malipong. (It will be hot and lining up will be difficult; people might faint.) We want it to be smooth-sailing,” he added. But at 5:30 pm at the San Jose Church, there will be a blessing for pregnant women and children. The foot procession from Muelle Loney Street features 15 floats carrying different images of the Santo Niño, winding through Montinola, Iznart and J.M. Basa streets and ending at the San Jose Church in front of Plaza Libertad for the mass and blessing of the floats, Sto. Niño images, and devotees.

Hastings co-founded the company in 1997 with entrepreneur Marc Randolph, who tweeted that his 7 years working with Hastings have been his “highlight” in his 40-plus years as an entrepreneur. In a blog post, Hastings said the succession had been in the works “for many years.” “Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years (even founders need to evolve!). As part of that process, we promoted Ted [Sarandos] to co-CEO alongside me in July 2020, and Greg [Peters] to chief operating officer – and in the last 2 1/2 years I’ve increasingly delegated the management of Netflix to them,” Hastings wrote. Peters will be stepping into a new role as co-CEO with Sarandos, while Hastings will take on a role as executive chairman, a role he notes that other tech founders often take. “Going forward, I’ll be serving as executive chairman, a role that founders often take (Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, etc.) after they pass the CEO baton to others,” Hastings said. As chairman, he’ll be “a bridge from the board to our co-CEOs.” Hastings tweeted he will be proud to serve in the role for “many years to come.” The executive also said he will be focusing more on philanthropy. Hastings credited Sarandos’ “early foresight and skill” to push for the company to produce original programming, which changed their “trajectory as a company,” while Peters is credited for driving partnerships, and for currently building their games initiative. The moves come in the wake of a solid Q4 2022 performance that saw the streaming giant rake in 7.66 million subscribers, beating Wall Street estimates of 4.57 million, with shows like Harry & Meghan, and Wednesday, which has become the third most-watched show in its history being credited for helping pull in viewers. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/peru-unrest-protests-january-20-2023/,[],"LIMA, Peru – Thousands of protesters in Peru, many from the country’s heavily indigenous south, descended on Lima, the capital,on Thursday, January 19, angered by a mounting death toll since unrest erupted last month and calling for sweeping change. Police estimated the march at around 3,500, but others speculated it attracted more than double that. Rows of police in riot gear faced off against rock-hurling protesters on some streets, and one historic building in the city’s historic center caught on fire late on Thursday. The building, on San Martin Plaza, was empty when the massive blaze ignited from unknown causes, a firefighter commander told local radio. Canada-based miner Hudbay said in a statement that protesters had entered the site of its Peru unit, damaging and burning key machinery and vehicles. “This has not been a protest; this has been a sabotage of the rule of law,” Prime Minister Alberto Otarola said Thursday evening alongside President Dina Boluarte and other government ministers. Interior Minister Vicente Romero disputed claims circulating on social media that the Lima blaze had been caused by a police officer’s tear gas grenade. Over the past month, raucous and sometimes deadly protests have led to the worst violence Peru has seen in over two decades as many in poorer, rural regions vent anger at the Lima establishment over inequality and rising prices, testing the copper-rich Andean nation’s democratic institutions. Protesters are demanding the resignation of President Dina Boluarte, snap elections, and a new constitution to replace the market-friendly one dating back to right-wing strongman Alberto Fujimori in the 1990s. “We want the usurper Dina Boluarte to step down and call for new elections,” said protester Jose De la Rosa, predicting the street protests will only continue. The protests have been sparked by the dramatic December 7 ouster of leftist former president Pedro Castillo after he tried to illegally shutter Congress and consolidate power. In buses and on foot, thousands journeyed to Lima on Thursday, carrying flags and banners blasting the government and police for deadly clashes in the southern cities of Ayacucho and Juliaca. The unrest spread far beyond the capital. In southern Arequipa, police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who tried to take over the airport, local television showed, leading officials to announce the suspension of operations at the Arequipa and Cusco airports. Boluarte said on Thursday evening that the airports, as well as one in the southern city of Juliaca, had been attacked “in a concerted manner.” “All the rigor of the law will fall on those people who have acted with vandalism,” Boluarte said. The mounting death toll stands at 45, according to the government ombudsman, with the latest victim on Thursday coming from southern Puno region, a woman who succumbed to injuries from a day earlier. Another nine deaths are attributed to accidents related to protest blockades. Across the nation, roadway blockades were seen in 18 of the country’s 25 regions, according to transport officials, underscoring the reach of the protests. Police had increased surveillance of roads entering Lima and political leaders called for calm. Last week, the embattled Boluarte government extended a state of emergency in Lima and the southern regions of Puno and Cusco, curtailing some civil rights. Boluarte said the situation in the country was “under control.” She called for dialogue. The president has asked for “forgiveness” for the protest deaths, even as protester banners label her a “murderer” and call the killings by security forces “massacres.” She has dismissed calls to resign. Human rights groups have accused the police and army of using deadly firearms in the protests. The police say the protesters have used weapons and homemade explosives. “We won’t forget the pain the police have caused in the town of Juliaca,” said one protester traveling to Lima, who did not give her name. She referred to the city where an especially deadly protest took place earlier this month. “We women, men, children have to fight.” Other protesters pointed to strategic reasons for targeting the coastal capital. “We want to centralize our movement here in Lima, which is the heart of Peru, to see if they are moved,” said protester Domingo Cueva, who had traveled from Cusco. “We have observed an increase in repressions everywhere,” he added. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/facebook-approved-ads-promoting-violence-brazil-riots-global-witness-test/,[],"LONDON, UK – Facebook approved a series of online ads promoting violence in Brazil, days after protesters ransacked government buildings, according to a new report. Earlier this month, thousands of supporters of Brazil’s far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the nation’s congress, supreme court, and presidential palace in an attack lasting more than three hours. In an attempt to stem the flow of posts inciting violence online, Facebook’s parent company Meta said it had designated Brazil as a “temporary high-risk location” and removed content calling for people to take up arms or forcibly invade government buildings. However, four days after the uprising, human rights organization Global Witness found Facebook was still allowing ads containing death threats and other calls to violence on its platform. Using fake accounts, the group submitted 16 bogus ads to run on the platform, 14 of which were approved for publication. Among the approved ads were messages which read, in Portuguese: “We need to unearth all the rats that have seized power and shoot them,” “We need a military revolution to restore the rule of law”, and “Death to the children of Lula voters.” Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office on January 1 after defeating Bolsonaro in a runoff election in October. Bolsonaro refused to concede defeat, however, and some supporters claimed the election was stolen. Global Witness also submitted the ads for approval on YouTube, but the video-sharing platform immediately suspended the group’s accounts. Global Witness said it withdrew the ads from Facebook before any other users could see them. “In the aftermath of the violence in Brasilia, Facebook said they were ‘actively monitoring’ the situation and removing content in violation of their policies. This test shows how poorly they’re able to enforce what they say,” said Rosie Sharpe, digital threats campaigner at Global Witness. “YouTube’s much stronger response demonstrates that the test we have set is possible to pass.” Meta spokesperson Mitch Henderson said Global Witness’ small sample of ads was not representative of how the company enforced its policies at scale. “Like we’ve said in the past, ahead of last year’s election in Brazil, we removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that violated our policies on violence and incitement and rejected tens of thousands of ad submissions before they ran. “We use technology and teams to help keep our platforms safe from abuse and we’re constantly refining our processes to enforce our policies at scale.” – Rappler.com"

The lifting of the face-covering rules will take effect on January 30, Han said, in the country’s latest step to ease COVID-19 rules as new cases show signs of a slowdown. “The daily number of new infections is continuing to decline and despite concerns over a spike in cases in China, the situation here is under control without major troubles,” the prime minister said during a COVID response meeting. South Korea has ordered COVID tests for travelers arriving from China after Beijing abandoned a strict anti-virus regime of mass lockdowns in an abrupt policy U-turn. Friday’s announcement comes exactly three years after South Korea reported its first outbreak of COVID infection on January 20, 2020 and as it is set to mark the Lunar New Year holidays during which many South Koreans return to their home towns. The easing of mask rules coupled with the upcoming holidays could result in a temporary surge in new cases, Han warned, urging health authorities to stay vigilant especially for those more vulnerable to infection. South Korea has scrapped most of its pandemic-related precautions, but it maintains a seven-day isolation rule for those testing positive for COVID. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-faa-unintentionally-deleted-files-caused-computer-outage/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday a preliminary review found that contract personnel “unintentionally deleted files” disrupting a key computer system and prompting a nationwide groundstop on January 11 that disrupted more than 11,000 flights. The FAA said the issue occurred while personnel were working “to correct synchronization between the live primary database and a backup database.” The FAA said it “has so far found no evidence of a cyber-attack or malicious intent.” FAA acting Administrator Billy Nolen plans to hold a virtual briefing Friday for lawmakers and staff, who have sought details of what went wrong with a pilot messaging database that led to the first nationwide grounding of departing flights since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Last week, the agency said the computer outage of the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) messaging system was caused by a procedural error related to a corrupted data file. The NOTAM system provides pilots, flight crews and other users of US airspace with critical safety notices. The FAA said it has made necessary repairs to the system “and has taken steps to make the pilot message system more resilient.” The system outage occurred on January 10, but the FAA groundstop was not issued until the following morning. Last week, a group of more than 120 US lawmakers told the FAA that the computer outage was “completely unacceptable” and demanded the agency explain how it will avoid future incidents. Senate commerce committee staff have also asked the FAA to answer questions on the outage, including, “Why were airlines put in a position where they could have the option of choosing to operate when the NOTAM system was down?” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/twitter-advertising-revenue-losses-final-months-2022/,[],"Top advertisers on Twitter slashed their spending after Elon Musk’s takeover, according to estimates compiled for Reuters by research firm Pathmatics, in the latest shock to the company’s dominant revenue source. Fourteen of the top 30 advertisers on Twitter stopped all advertising on the platform after Musk took charge on October 27, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Four advertisers reduced spending between 92% and 98.7% from the week before Musk’s acquisition through the end of the year. Overall, advertising spending by the top 30 companies fell by 42% to an estimated $53.8 million for November and December combined, according to Pathmatics, despite an increase in spending by six of them. Pathmatics said the previously unreported figures on Twitter advertising are estimates. The firm bases its estimates on technologies that track ads on desktop browsers and the Twitter app as well as those that mimic user experience. But the company said those estimates do not account for deals advertisers may receive from Twitter, or promoted trends and accounts. “It is possible the spending data could be higher for some brands” if Twitter is offering incentives, Pathmatics said in an email. Twitter did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a November event on Twitter Spaces, Musk, addressing the issue of companies pausing ads, said that he understands if advertisers “want to give it a minute.” He added that “the best way to see how things are evolving (at Twitter) is just use Twitter.” Technology-focused publication The Information, citing details shared by a top Twitter ad executive at a staff meeting on Wednesday, reported that Twitter’s fourth quarter revenue fell about 35% year over year due to a slump in advertising. Twitter posted a loss of $270 million in the three months ended June 30, on total revenue of about $1.18 billion. The Pathmatics estimates show continued upheaval in Twitter’s main revenue stream heading into 2023, led by a pullback from top consumer brands. Forward bookings, or agreements to lock in future ads, were also down for January and February, according to research firm Standard Media Index, which did not provide details. Twitter is moving to reverse the advertiser exodus. It has introduced a slew of initiatives to win back advertisers, offering some free ads, lifting a ban on political advertising and allowing companies greater control over the positioning of their ads. “They’re frankly really amazing incentives. Honestly, I’ve not seen that type of incentive ever from any advertiser,” said Molly Lopez, owner of ad agency HITE Digital Miami. In addition, Mark DiMassimo, founder of New York-based ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein, said that “bargain basement” direct marketers and political action committees – big spenders on Meta Platform Inc’s Facebook – may fill the advertising gap. Coca-Cola Co. halted spending in mid November, after purchasing an estimated $1.1 million in Twitter ads earlier that month, while HBO spending collapsed to approximately $38,000 in December from roughly $1.1 million in November, Pathmatics found. Coca-Cola declined to comment. HBO spokesperson Chris Willard did not comment on the specifics of advertising spending, but said “we will be assessing the platform under its new leadership and determine appropriate next steps.” Among consumer brands, Heinz ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co. and Stouffers meal manufacturer Nestle stopped all advertising, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Heinz and Nestle declined to comment. Mass retailer Target Corp. and department store operator Kohls Corp. also skipped advertising on Twitter on Black Friday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year, the estimates show. Kohls did not return requests for comment. However, Apple Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. increased spending, according to Pathmatics. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. PepsiCo declined to comment. Financial technology provider SmartAsset and Amazon.com Inc. said Pathmatics estimates showing an increase in advertising were inaccurate. Amazon did not elaborate further and SmartAsset said the figures were “inflated” without giving details. Pathmatics said “we want to reiterate that our figures are just estimates.” Musk’s arrival at Twitter exacerbated a drop in advertising that began in September after Reuters reported that promotions appeared alongside tweets soliciting child pornography. Most of the companies stopped spending in November, the estimates show, the same month that Musk restored suspended accounts and released a paid account verification that resulted in scammers impersonating corporations. Telecommunications company AT&T Inc. and pet food provider Mars Inc. slashed spending in September due to concerns about brand safety. As the companies pulled back on Twitter, they maintained and in some cases boosted advertising on Meta Platform Inc’s Facebook and Instagram and on short video app TikTok, according to Pathmatics. Meta and TikTok did not immediately return requests for comment. AT&T said it paused advertising in September because of “concerns around content appearing next” to its ads. The company has been talking to Twitter about its concerns, according to a person familiar with AT&T’s thinking. Mars said its “suspension remains in effect.” Twitter has said to Reuters it is investing in child safety. The platform is leaning on automation to moderate content and restrict abuse-prone hashtags and search results in areas including child exploitation. Companies also scaled back on tweeting. As of January 19, Target and Special K cereal maker Kellogg Co. hadn’t tweeted since October; Coca-Cola and electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc. paused tweeting in November, according to a Reuters review of the company’s main feeds. Target, Best Buy and Kellogg did not return requests for comment. – Rappler.com"

In detention, the vloggers learned this lesson the hard way: next time, better stick to the old “knock, knock” jokes. Police arrested vloggers Jonel Cordero and Arnold Rabi for their ill-conceived prank on Wednesday, January 18, in downtown Mawab, Davao de Oro province for causing a public disturbance. The duo had purchased a small amount of gasoline and put it in a soft drink bottle, with Cordero pretending to chug it down while Rabi secretly recorded the scene. As onlookers, including customers at Green Planet gas station, panicked at the sight of Cordero fainting and vomiting, the establishment’s crew quickly called for assistance from the town’s disaster risk reduction and management office. However, shortly after the first aid team rushed to the scene, Cordero suddenly broke into laughter, revealing that the whole thing was just a prank for his social media vlog. It turned out, he had switched bottles and consumed an energy drink, which had the same color as the gasoline he bought. Police Major Eudisan Gultiano, spokesperson for the Davao Police Regional Office, had stern words for the pranksters, reminding vloggers to refrain from actions that could result in public disturbance and waste other people’s time and resources. Gultiano said pranks like this were not only unacceptable, but they also divert valuable resources away from where they are truly needed. The Mawab Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (MDRRMO) also issued a public notice cautioning vloggers and pranksters. “Wala man mo gibawalan nga maglingaw-lingaw anang inyong pranks apan hangyo lang mi, ayaw idamay kining emergency concerns (No one is preventing you from having fun with pranks such as this, but we ask that you spare those focusing on emergency concerns),” the town’s MDRRMO posted on its Facebook page. Police said the vloggers would be charged with alarm and scandal based on the Revised Penal Code, which carries a penalty of 30 days of imprisonment and a fine of P40,000. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/eu-unicef-aid-marawi-siege-survivors-children/,[],"MARAWI, Philippines – As the echoes of gunfire and explosions fade into the past, the people of Marawi and Lanao del Sur continue to struggle with the aftermath of the five months of fighting during the 2017 Marawi Siege. The European Union (EU) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have stepped in to provide P245 million more to aid the hundreds of thousands of Maranaos still suffering from the devastating conflict. The EU and UNICEF launched a program in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) on Wednesday, January 18, to improve community resilience, increase coverage of essential services and promote child-friendly family and community behaviors in Marawi City and Lanao del Sur. The program would also benefit residents in the neighboring provinces of Lanao del Norte and Bukidnon in Northern Mindanao. The program aims to address the dire situation faced by many in Marawi and Lanao del Sur where a whole generation of children have seen their capacity to thrive as adults hampered as a result of internal displacement, limited development opportunities, and the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the Bangsamoro region’s sustainable development and long-lasting peace. Officials said more than 80% of Maranao children live in poverty today, and their rights to health, education, and protection are left wanting. The five-month Marawi Siege during the Duterte administration had a devastating impact on the lives of the people of Marawi and Lanao del Sur, many of whom were unable to return to their homes and rebuild. Officials said the siege resulted in a high number of internally displaced persons (IDPs), many of whom continue to struggle with poverty and limited access to basic services to this day. BARMM, Marawi, and Lanao del Sur officials said the collaboration between the EU and UNICEF would be an important step in ensuring that the basic rights of Maranaos are upheld, and that they have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives and communities. The program, called “Building Community Resilience and Delivery of Essential Services for Post-Conflict Recovery in Lanao del Sur/Marawi City,” has been given a budget of 4 million Euros and would fund health, education, child protection, and disaster risk reduction programs that would benefit 680,000 children, 200,000 parents, and 120,000 IDPs. Special focus would be given to children with disabilities, indigenous children, out-of-school youth, adolescents at risk of being recruited into armed groups, internally displaced persons, and girls. The program is aimed at improving maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health, nutrition, water, and sanitation services, early childhood education and basic education services, child protection/social welfare system, and child-friendly provincial and municipal planning and investment for children’s rights and reducing disaster risks. Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra welcomed the aid from the EU and UNICEF, and their collaboration with the BARMM, Lanao del Sur, and Marawi officials, saying it would help many Maranaos still suffering from the effects of the Marawi Siege. The 2017 conflict, according to Gandamra, had a severe impact on the region’s economy and development, stunting the growth of Marawi and Lanao del Sur. The Marawi Siege had a severe impact on the children in the region. Many were forced to flee their homes and were separated from their families, leaving them vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, and recruitment by armed groups. Many also missed out on education and other basic services, resulting in a generation of children facing limited opportunities for the future. “Our journey to development and peace lives on in every Bangsamoro youth who carries our dreams into the future. The unrelenting support of our partners enables us to shape a Bangsamoro that nurtures the health and well-being of every child,” said BARMM interim Chief Minister Ahod “Murad” Ebrahim. UNICEF Philippines representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said sustainable development, peace, and security would not be achieved until every child has their rights fulfilled, respected, and protected. “Children have a right to just be children and play, learn and spend time with family and friends. Safeguarding the next generation from the effects of armed conflict is our collective responsibility,” Dendevnorov said. EU Ambassador Luc Veron said the project supports the BARMM’s regional and local authorities’ capacity to plan and deliver essential services, from health and sanitation to education and social protection, and contribute to the fulfillment of basic human rights, with a special focus on children. Veron said, “The EU is proud to have the opportunity to help fund this effort and partner with the Bangsamoro authorities and UNICEF as part of our long-standing commitment to the well-being of children and peace and development in the BARMM.” Lanao del Sur Governor Mamintal Adiong Jr. said the program would not only benefit the current generation but also future generations as Maranaos strive for a healthier, more secure, socially protected, and child-friendly city and province. Adiong said the collaboration and the help from the EU and UNICEF is a significant step towards providing much-needed aid and support to the people of Marawi and Lanao del Sur. – Rappler.com"

The official declined to say when the visit took place. The Washington Post, which first reported the visit, said it took place at the end of last week. Burns briefed Zelenskiy on his expectations on Russia’s upcoming military plans, the newspaper said, adding he also acknowledged that at some point US assistance would be harder to come by. Zelenskiy and his senior intelligence officials discussed how long Ukraine could expect US and Western assistance to continue after Republicans won a narrow majority in the US House of Representatives in the midterm elections, the Washington Post reported, citing sources. Zelenskiy and his aides came away from last week’s meeting with the impression that US support for Kyiv remained strong, the newspaper said. Western allies have pledged billions of dollars in weapons for Ukraine. Fearing winter will give Russian forces time to regroup and unleash a major attack, Ukraine is pushing for more assistance to combat Moscow’s invasion which began in February last year. In his trip to Washington in December, Zelenskiy told the US Congress that aid to Ukraine is an investment in democracy, and not charity, while pressing for continued American support. The United States on Thursday announced a new package of military assistance for Ukraine it valued at up to $2.5 billion, including hundreds of armored vehicles and support for Ukraine’s air defense. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-congressman-george-santos-drag-queen-brazil-pageants/,[],"SAO PAULO, Brazil – US Representative George Santos competed as a drag queen in Brazilian beauty pageants 15 years ago, two acquaintances told Reuters on Wednesday, January 18, adding to contrasts that have drawn criticism of the openly gay Republican congressman’s staunchly conservative views. The embattled freshman congressman has also faced calls from fellow New York Republicans to step down over fabrications about his career and history. A 58-year-old Brazilian performer, who uses the drag name Eula Rochard, said she befriended the now-congressman when he was cross-dressing in 2005 at the first gay pride parade in Niteroi, a Rio de Janeiro suburb. Three years later, Santos competed in a drag beauty pageant in Rio, Rochard said. Another person from Niteroi who knew the 34-year-old congressman but asked not to be named said he participated in drag queen beauty pageants and aspired to be Miss Gay Rio de Janeiro. The congressman said on Twitter on Thursday that claims “that I am a drag Queen or ‘performed’ as a drag Queen” are “categorically false,” adding: “I will not be distracted nor fazed by this.” Santos is the first openly gay Republican to win a House seat in Congress as a non-incumbent, but has positioned himself as a staunch conservative on many social issues. He has backed Florida’s controversial “Parental Rights in Education” law, which prohibits classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, leading critics to call it the “don’t say gay” law. Republicans are increasingly denouncing drag shows and performers, claiming they are harmful to children. Santos, responding in October to criticism of his support for the Florida law, told USA Today: “I am openly gay, have never had an issue with my sexual identity in the past decade, and I can tell you and assure you, I will always be an advocate for LGBTQ folks.” Rochard said the congressman was a “poor” drag queen in 2005, with a simple black dress, but in 2008 “he came back to Niteroi with a lot of money,” and a flamboyant pink dress to show for it. Santos competed in a drag beauty pageant that year using the drag name Kitara Ravache but lost, Rochard said. “He’s changed a lot, but he was always a liar. He was always such a dreamer,” Rochard said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/david-crosby-dies/,[],"David Crosby, one of the most influential rock singers of the 1960s and ’70s with the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) has died at the age of 81, Variety reported on Thursday, January 19, citing a statement from Crosby’s wife. Crosby was a founding member of two revered rock bands: the country and folk-influenced Byrds, for whom he cowrote the hit “Eight Miles High,” and Crosby, Stills & Nash, later Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, who defined the smooth side of the Woodstock generation’s music. “It is with a deep and profound sadness that I learned that my friend David Crosby has passed,” Graham Nash, his longtime collaborator and sometime sparring partner, said in a statement. “I know people tend to focus on how volatile our relationship has been at times, but what has always mattered to David and me more than anything was the pure joy of the music we created together…and the deep friendship we shared,” Nash said. Crosby’s wife, Jan Dance, announced the death in a statement published by Variety. It did not specify when he died, nor the cause. Crosby’s British-based representatives could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters. Musically, Crosby stood out for his intricate vocal harmonies, unorthodox open tunings on guitar and incisive songwriting. His work with both the Byrds and CSN/CSNY blended rock and folk in new ways and their music became a part of the soundtrack for the hippie era. “I don’t know what to say other than I’m heartbroken to hear about David Crosby. David was an unbelievable talent – such a great singer and songwriter. And a wonderful person,” Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson said on Twitter. Personally, Crosby was the embodiment of the credo “sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll,” and a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine article tagged him “rock’s unlikeliest survivor.” In addition to drug addictions that ultimately led to a transplant to replace a liver worn out by decades of excess, his tumultuous life included a serious motorcycle accident, the death of a girlfriend, and battles against hepatitis C and diabetes. “I’m concerned that the time I’ve got here is so short, and I’m pissed at myself, deeply, for the 10 years – at least – of time that I wasted just getting smashed,” Crosby told the Los Angeles Times in July 2019. “I’m ashamed of that.” He fell “as low as a human being can go,” Crosby told the Times. He also managed to alienate many of his famous former bandmates for which he often expressed remorse in recent years. His drug habits and often abrasive personality contributed to the demise of CSNY and the members eventually quit speaking to each other. In the 2019 documentary “David Crosby: Remember My Name,” he made clear he hoped they could work together again but conceded the others “really dislike me, strongly.” Crosby fathered six children – two as a sperm donor to rocker Melissa Etheridge’s partner and another who was placed for adoption at birth and did not meet Crosby until he was in his 30s. That son, James Raymond, would eventually become his musical collaborator. “Thank you @thedavidcrosby I will miss you my friend,” Etheridge said on Twitter alongside a photo of the two of them. Looking back at the turbulent 1960s and his life, Crosby told Time magazine in 2006: “We were right about civil rights; we were right about human rights; we were right about peace being better than war … But I think we didn’t know our butt from a hole in the ground about drugs and that bit us pretty hard.” Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles. His father was a cinematographer who won a Golden Globe for “High Noon” in 1952 and his mother exposed him to the folk group the Weavers and to classical music. As a teenager, Crosby found that one of his passions aided him in the pursuit of another. “It (playing music) was absolutely joyous to me,” he wrote. “I always loved it. I always will love it. And I did get laid.” After a stay in New York’s Greenwich Village music scene, Crosby was back in California in 1963 and helped Roger McGuinn start the Byrds, whose first hit, a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Mr. Tambourine Man,” came in 1965, followed by “Turn! Turn! Turn!” Crosby was kicked out of the Byrds because the band did not want to play his songs with the flashpoint being “Triad,” about a menage a trois, and disputes over on-stage political rants. Crosby and Stephen Stills, whose band with Neil Young Buffalo Springfield had fallen apart, then began playing together. Graham Nash of the Hollies, who met Crosby in 1966 and went on to become his closest collaborator and a closer friend, joined them. Their first album, “Crosby, Stills and Nash,” was a big seller in 1969 with such songs as “Marrakesh Express,” “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” and “Guinnevere.” Guitarist and singer/songwriter Young fell in with them that year and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young came to be considered one of the greatest amalgams of talent in rock history. Their second performance together was the landmark Woodstock music festival in 1969 and their 1970 album, “Deja Vu” contained hits “Teach Your Children,” and “Woodstock,” and one of Crosby’s signature songs, “Almost Cut My Hair.” As CSNY was taking off, Crosby was in a drug-fueled downward spiral caused by the 1969 death of girlfriend Christine Hinton in a car accident. “I had no way to deal with that, nothing in my life had prepared me for that,” wrote Crosby, who had added cocaine and heroin to his drug repertoire. The next decade was a blur of drug arrests, album releases and women. “I was not into being monogamous – I made that plain to everybody concerned. I was a complete and utter pleasure-seeking sybarite,” he wrote in his autobiography. Crosby had a daughter with a girlfriend but soon left her for Jan Dance, who moved in with him in 1978. That relationship lasted and they had a son, Django, in 1995. Crosby introduced Dance to heroin and the free-basing method of smoking cocaine. “We went down the tubes together but we did it with our hearts intertwined,” he wrote. There were several failed attempts at rehab and Crosby developed a reputation as a bloated, hapless addict. In 1985, Nash told Rolling Stone: “I’ve tried everything – extreme anger, extreme compassion. I’ve gotten 20 of his best friends in the same room with him. I’ve tried hanging out with him. I’ve tried not hanging out with him.” Crosby beat a series of drug charges but lost in Texas after being arrested with a drug pipe and gun at a club in Dallas and went to prison in 1985. The prison system required him to shave his trademark bushy mustache, but he found solace in playing in the prison band during his year of incarceration. “Playing and singing straight was an unfamiliar feeling,” he wrote. “I hadn’t been onstage with a drug-free system in more than 25 years.” After his release, Crosby told People magazine he had beaten his addictions. “Most people who go as far as I did with drugs are dead,” he said. “Hard drugs will hook anyone. I don’t care who you are…I have a Ph.D. in drugs.” He was also arrested on gun and marijuana charges in New York in 2004. In 2014 he released “Croz,” his first solo album since 1993, but his tour to promote the record was interrupted in February by heart surgery. He continued recording and was an active, presence on Twitter, in addition to writing an advice column in Rolling Stone. (IN PHOTOS: Crosby, Stills & Nash in unforgettable Manila concert) In March 2021, the Guardian reported that Crosby sold the recorded music and publishing rights to his entire music catalog to Irving Azoff’s Iconic Artists Group for an undisclosed sum. He was quoted as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic prevented him from playing concerts and that the widespread use of music streaming “stole my money.” – Rappler.com"

The Mendiola Massacre happened on January 22, 1987. That evening after the massacre, Mat and I boarded a passenger jeepney and went to the office of a newspaper that published Mat’s photo on its front page the following morning. His photo captured one of the rarest scenes of the event: a fallen demonstrator. Mat and I did not talk about the specifics of what we had witnessed. He showed me photos of some other scenes he was able to capture – of a raised fist by a young man shouting in defiance, hunkering down in front of a wounded, dying comrade – whom he could no longer carry or bring along with him due to the hail of bullets. Another of several slain demonstrators lying at the foot of Mendiola Bridge. But we just looked at those photos. Silent. A couple of times, too, he talked about the whizzing of bullets around us, our head and body, saying bullets were “ricocheting” everywhere. I remained quiet. The third time he mentioned it, I looked at him in the eye and told him, “Pinaputukan tayo (We were fired upon).” Mat was stunned, mum. The scenes of the massacre never really left me, although I had tucked those away to where I couldn’t reach or delve into; but I knew those have always been a part of me, deep, deep within me. Those had been etched at the core of my being. The staccato of gunfire, the scenes of demonstrators swiftly falling as if swept by blasts of wind, amid the smoke of gunpowder. The biting, toxic, excruciating sensation of tear gas to the eyes, throat, lips, mouth, lungs, and skin. The scenes ran for seconds. The stark imagery of the fallen marchers. One by one, while watching them fall from where I was initially crouched, half-kneeling; crossroads of disbelief and the stab of reality pierced my mind. In intervals of nanoseconds, one by one they fell. I deliberately kept my mind and vision alert then, knowing that what I was witnessing was a historic event; while enveloped by uncertainty as to whether Mat and I would survive. I mentally counted eight demonstrators – one by one – falling as bullets hit them. Falling as visibly freshly slain bodies surrounded them. Earlier, as I watched them defiantly face the hail of bullets, I knew they got no chance of surviving. Their death in all certitude was instantaneous. The bodies I helped carry minutes earlier in front of the Corona Book Supply were all lifeless. Their gunshot wounds were all to the head. The brains and blood of one of them – the last one I lifted up and carried – even slithered down my arm, hand, bag, pants, and shoe. Looking at my arm and hand immediately afterwards, I felt stumped, wondering what it was. When the realization dawned on me, I screamed in shock: “Utak! Utak! (Brains!)” I retched. I scoured the foot of Mendiola Bridge afterwards. Rubber shoes, backpack, shirt, broken placard, streamer, handkerchief, bandana, rocks, wooden stick – abandoned by those who hurriedly left the pandemonium. No weapon. No gun. No grenade. I did not see a single metal bar from the fence earlier ripped apart by of demonstrators at Liwasang Bonifacio. Pools of blood showing signs of beginning to dry up. After helping photojournalists carry the fallen, I approached the centerline at the foot of Mendiola Bridge where the eight frontliners died. The smoke from gunpowder had relatively cleared. Three of them lay lifeless atop each other. Their bodies randomly heaped atop each other. They were young. Perhaps in their early 20s. A uniformed police officer looked happy. Scores were wounded. Days later, I met and interviewed one of them – a young worker who was manning their picket line at a factory in Valenzuela, Metro Manila, prior to the march. He was confined at the Philippine General Hospital, located along Taft Avenue, Manila. His first question upon seeing me – and that was for the first time – was: “Where is my eye?” Innocently he asked. He lost an eye due to gunfire at Mendiola. The bullet pierced through his eye and exited near his temple. I thought it was a miracle that he had survived. This is more than a survivor’s personal and journalistic narrative. It is a historic moment in Philippine history. It is known as the Mendiola Massacre. At least 13 marchers were killed. It occurred less than a year after the February 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution that ousted fascist Ferdinand E. Marcos. On hindsight, as I reflect, the eight demonstrators, whom I had seen with my own eyes felled one by one by rains of bullets, occupied the front and center of the demonstrators’ line at the foot of Mendiola Bridge. Before they were slain, sporadic bursts of gunfire had already erupted and begun to intensify several minutes earlier. The intersection of Mendiola, Claro M. Recto, and Legarda streets had already been cleared of thousands of demonstrators (who, with lightning speed, frenziedly scampered away, driven out and chased by hails of bullets) when those eight demonstrators were mowed down. Years later, as I revisited this macabre scene in my mind, I came to realize that those eight demonstrators, like me, could just as easily have opted to drop to the ground as soon as the shootings started in order to try and avoid getting hit somehow. Now, I realize that their being sprayed with bullets while standing on their feet and while deliberately facing armed Marines soldiers and police officers was their own conscious choice. They refused to turn their back and run away just like what the thousands of demonstrators instinctively did. Opting to stay, they neither dropped to the ground to avoid getting hit. Standing on their feet to face bursts of gunfire speaks volumes. They did not blink nor balk. Only one (he was wearing a white shirt) stooped involuntarily while falling, not because of fear, but because of the bullets that apparently peppered his body’s mid-region. The rest were swiftly swept down by gunfire while standing straight, all while facing their shooters. They made a brave, last stand. Defiance. Their refusal to drop to the ground or to run, their decision to stay on, to hold the line, to keep standing facing bursts of gunfire was political. It was a message. Conviction. They stood for and defied death for their conviction. Theirs, now I realize, was a warrior’s stand. Unarmed resistance. Time passed. On occasions, upon waking up, my consciousness asked: “Why am I still alive?” Coming from my innermost recesses. I did not know the answer. Something…something moves me on. There must be a reason. One morning, the answer came in: Mendiola. I live for those who passed on, for those who now live, and for those who — in the future — will live. We are one. – Rappler.com An award-winning investigative journalist and licensed attorney, Perfecto Caparas serves as a teaching fellow and founding director of the Center for Holistic International Human Rights Law Praxis of the National University of the Union of Myanmar-Burmese American Community Institute."
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/mendiola-massacre-journalist-account/,[],"This is the hitherto untold story of the fallen frontliners during the Mendiola Massacre. Thirty-six years ago. Watching about 10 meters from where they stood, I personally witnessed the massacre of demonstrators at the foot of Mendiola Bridge.[1] Located in San Miguel, Manila, Philippines, Mendiola Bridge – traditional site of protests – leads to Malacañan Palace. It is the seat of the presidency. It was late afternoon, Thursday, January 22, 1987. For weeks, I had been covering the farmers’ mass sit-in in front of the Department of Agrarian Reform across the Elliptical Circle in Quezon City for Kalatas Paggawa (Labor Herald), a trade union workers’ publication. From the very beginning, the scene at Mendiola Bridge was foreboding. When I arrived, there were no barbed wired barricades at the foot of the bridge, unlike during the other numerous demonstrations that I had covered there before. Yet, this was a major, massive mobilization. Instead, there were lines of Marines soldiers in full battle gear and armed with M16s right at the foot of the bridge. I checked the area. Behind the Marines were a firetruck and a military truck. Television crews, police crowd dispersal units, and soldiers were there. I made sure to go there earlier than the marchers. Earlier, at Liwasang Bonifacio – one of the converging points – several demonstrators dismantled the metal fence near the Post Office and grabbed its detached, broken steel bars. The flatbed of the truck at Mendiola (where I briefly stood, held, and pulled up the hand of a female TV reporter to help her get on the truck), I thought, was a relatively safe spot to be. The only thing that one might need to protect oneself from might be rocks that a strong demonstrator might throw. But I suddenly thought of Mateo “Mat” Vicencio, knowing how mobile, focused, and engaged he would be in a coverage like this. Mat had our publication’s camera as he, aside from being a reporter, was our main photographer. I quickly jumped from the truck and hurriedly looked for him. We needed to observe our buddy system, our security protocol. Instead of coming with me to the truck, however, Mat said that he needed to cover Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Farmers’ Movement of the Philippines) spokesperson Jaime “Ka Jaime” Tadeo. With a sense of urgency, Mat told me – and with a tone of certainty – that Tadeo will be arrested (“Aarestuhin si Ka Jaime!”) during the negotiations between the demonstrators and anti-riot police. Mat wanted to capture that scenario on film. That spot was, if ever trouble broke out, along the direct line of fire. Mat and I positioned ourselves at the frontlines of the demonstrators right where Tadeo was talking with the police officer in command of the phalanx of anti-riot police. Tension was high. When I saw that their security cordon was signaled by the apparent team leader to pull Tadeo and the other mass leaders out, I knew instantly that skirmishes would break out right away. Given the mass of bodies, Mat and I were too far away to be able to squeeze our way through and go behind the government cordon. The Corona Book Supply store building to our right facing Mendiola was the closest spot we can go to for our safety, so I thought. I firmly held Mat by the shoulders and pushed him against other shoving bodies towards the store. Mat and I were sandwiched and swept by bodies as the ranks of demonstrators darted, swarmed, pushed, and dashed towards the police and soldiers. Mat and I managed to inch our way only towards the gutter fronting the store, swamped by bodies from all directions. Then sporadic bursts of gunfire rang out. I instinctively shouted repeatedly, “Dapa! Dapa! Dapa!” (Drop to the ground!) and motioned to demonstrators with my two hands for them to drop to the ground. We were only able to crouch, half-bend our bodies as we were all lumped tightly together shoulder-to-shoulder in a vast sea of humanity. All alert. I looked up and around and scanned the surroundings. Amid the staccato of gunfire, a bullet whizzed through my scalp. I immediately dropped to the ground, and saw that all the demonstrators around me were already on the ground. We were riveted to the ground as continuous, nonstop gunshots rang out. When I raised my head and looked around – as the hail of bullets intensified – the demonstrators disappeared from my sight. Suddenly, it was just Mat and me. I turned my head and saw only the tail end of the swarm of demonstrators scampering away along Legarda Street near the direction of the National Teachers College in Quiapo. I found myself hugging the ground by the gutter, with Mat half-sitting in front of me. I was hoping we would not be hit, while psychologically preparing myself to be struck by a bullet or two or three at the same time, as bullets whizzed around us. I was hoping that if ever I got hit, it would be somewhere where I could still live and move actively as I wanted to continue with the work I was doing. I was determined to survive. I cannot see gunmen across the streets. Yet, I knew our position was vulnerable. We were at the gutter in front of Corona Book Supply. To my left, about two meters away, was a bloodied man, in dirty white shirt, lying on his back. His arms raised, one higher than the other, asking for help. Farther away were three more bodies lying along Legarda Street, fronting Corona Book Supply. Unmoving. Thoughts raced in my mind. Bullets were whizzing all around us. If I reach out to him out there in the open street, I may be hit. Gunfire raged incessantly. If I took the risk, and pulled him right where we were, I was not sure how safe he will be either, as gunmen could fire upon us. Our own position was vulnerable as well. Also, I thought: what will I do if I pulled him close to us by the gutter? I knew nothing about first aid. Hopefully, he would be safe where he was. Uncertain as to where the other shooters were positioned, I pulled down Mat and shouted at him several times to drop to the ground; but he was immobile. He was taking pictures without looking through the camera lens. He was quietly clicking the camera that he held stably in his right hand that was lowered to his knee, close to the ground. That was the way Mat taught me to take pictures in situations where our own life was in peril: do not look through the lens, just point and continuously click until your last breath. I quickly pulled Mat bodily with all the force I could muster towards the concrete wall of Corona Book Supply, hoping to protect both of us somehow from the direct line of fire. Our position was perpendicular to where the soldiers and police officers were positioned at Mendiola Bridge. Across the streets, there were likely shooters who were not visible to us. Single shots. M16s; automatic gunfire; not just one, not just two. Not just three. The Sag-od and Escalante massacres of recent years raced through my mind. How could this be? At the heart of the city? The capital? Near Malacañan? Was it this worse during the First Quarter Storm?[2] Then, I noticed: Mat, I became alarmed, froze, his stare turned blank as gunpowder smoke hovered around. Teargas bombs exploded. He was mindlessly standing up, gazing at the unfolding carnage at the foot of Mendiola Bridge, visibly shocked, seemingly unaware of the staccato of gunfire that was whipping through the hazy late afternoon air. Seemingly unaware of the vulnerability of our position to gunfire. I kept pulling him down by his shoulders with my two hands, but he kept standing up. I had to eventually hold and forcefully and firmly pull down Mat by the back of his belt and denim pants to force him to crouch to the ground and to avoid getting hit. His hands at one of the most critical junctures were down, not taking pictures as we journalists were supposed to. But reminding him about that was not an option at that moment. And instead, I made sure he and I will be both “safe”. Moments later, I saw Mat taking pictures while he was (hopefully) safe enough in a squatting position. Not once did Mat drop to the ground. He either squatted or stood. Our gaze was both riveted towards the centerline at the foot of Mendiola Bridge. We were speechless.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/sc-orders-temporarily-release-enrile-former-staff-gigi-reyes-pork-barrel-scam/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Jessica Lucila “Gigi” Reyes, the former chief of staff of Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile tagged in the pork barrel scam, was temporarily released from jail on Thursday, January 19, after the Supreme Court (SC) granted her the privilege of writ of habeas corpus. In a statement, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) confirmed Reyes’ release and said she was freed at around 6:30 pm on Thursday, January 19. “The petition is meritorious. Petitioner is entitled to the writ of habeas corpus. Her confinement, though in accordance with a court order of the Sandiganbayan, has become oppressive thus infringing upon her right to liberty,” the SC ruling read. Reyes, the chief of staff of staff of Enrile when he was Senate President, has been under detention in Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City since 2014. She was charged with graft and plunder for the alleged misuse of Enrile’s Priority Development Assistance Fund, connected with the multibillion-peso pork barrel scam. The writ of habeas corpus is a legal remedy often used by activists to challenge the detention of a person and lobby their release. The SC said the extraordinary writ can also be used “to inquire into the cause of detention of a person.” In its ruling, the High Court’s First Division ruled that the writ of habeas corpus can be applied to all cases of legal confinement or detention. The SC noted that the writ can extend to people whose right to speedy trial has been infringed. “While the writ is generally not available to a person whose liberty is under custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge, when such custody becomes vexatious, capricious, and oppressive amounting to an infringement on the constitutional right to speedy trial of an accused, the writ of habeas corpus may be provisionally availed of,” the First Division ruled. “Otherwise stated, when the custody of a person becomes illegal due to the grave abuse of his or her constitutional rights, the person deprived of liberty may avail of the writ of habeas corpus.” The court also gave at least four points as to why the privilege of writ was granted on the ground of violation of constitutional right to speedy trial. First, the SC said the most basic criterion is that a person must be illegally deprived of his or her freedom. The SC, as second point, said the writ can be issued when there is a deprivation of a constitutional right “resulting in the restraint of a person.” As third point, the High Court also gave three grounds as to when the right to speedy trial has been violated. This includes “long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his or her case tried.” Fourth and last, the SC said the granting of the writ of habeas corpus is not based on merits of the case, but to provide “provisional liberty” to protect the petitioner’s constitutional right. “This remedy is rooted on the determination that the accused’s detention has been attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays,” the High Court added. The SC also noted in its decision that the granting of temporary liberty through the extraordinary writ does not involve the mother or principal case, and that the case can proceed independently. On why Reyes was able to avail the writ, the SC said she proved that her detention had become “vexatious restraint.” The court added: “While such order is lawful, petitioner’s continued detention had become an undue restraint on her liberty due to the peculiar protracted proceedings attendant in the principal case.” The privilege of writ of habeas corpus is usually granted to those illegally arrested. The SC ruling now set the guidelines on temporarily release using the extraordinary writ, according to lawyer Kristina Conti. Meanwhile, former SC spokesperson Ted Te said since the High Court did not designate the ruling as pro hac vice (in this instance only), others like detained former senator Leila de Lima can file a similar petition as a “test.”"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/jacinda-ardern-resignation-resonates-women-power/,[],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand – The shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world’s youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the demands faced by women in power. Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old said she had next to nothing left “in the tank” and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office. “Politicians are human,” she said. “We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.” Among the admiration from world figures there was also an appreciation of why the job may have taken its toll. “I will miss her, but I understand her point,” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum meeting. Ardern’s remarks alluded to the challenges of having a young family in office, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand’s University of Canterbury. She made a point of telling her daughter Neve that she was looking forward to being there when she started school this year and told her longtime partner Clarke Gayford that it was time they married. “She was just very upfront and relatable,” added Brady. “I think any young woman that has grown up in this era where we can have it all, yes, but actually we still have our heart connections to our loved ones.” Women have been liberated but “patriarchal institutions” have not evolved enough to support family life, she said. “We need people like Jacinda Ardern in politics. So, her situation is cause for reflection about what we can do more to support women in politics, and men and their family life too,” Brady added. In Davos, in an interview with Reuters, the president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, said, “I have all the respect for Jacinda and I admire her. I’m sorry she made such a decision, but this might be a temporary decision. It’s not easy.” During her time in office, Ardern has not been afraid to break the mould, becoming the first prime minister since Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto to have a baby in the job and then take maternity leave. A politician who campaigned on making tertiary education partially free, tackling child poverty and decriminalizing abortion, Ardern has also called out blatant sexism in politics. After meeting Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin last November, she dismissed a suggestion by reporters that their similar age and gender was the reason for the meeting. “She shifted the face of politics globally just by being her,” said Marian Baird, a professor of gender and employment relations at the University of Sydney. “I think she has been a bit of a model for younger female politicians and perhaps even younger male politicians who want to present in a different way,” she said. “Certainly she really challenges the male stereotype of being a prime minister.” Despite her high profile globally, Ardern’s popularity had waned domestically, hurt by rising living costs, growing crime and concern about social issues. In the wake of her resignation she has been lauded as a leader who bought grace and generosity of spirit to the job, particularly amid challenging political times. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark said Ardern had done an “extraordinary job” in leading New Zealand through major crises. She delivered on a key social and economic agenda, and positioned the nation as one that “stood for co-operation and decent values”. “The pressures on prime ministers are always great, but in this era of social media, clickbait, and 24/7 media cycles, Jacinda has faced a level of hatred and vitriol which in my experience is unprecedented in our country,” Clark said in a statement. “Our society could now usefully reflect on whether it wants to continue to tolerate the excessive polarization which is making politics an increasingly unattractive calling.” Cambodian opposition figure Mu Sochua said the world had lost a leader who commanded trust and respect, and “always led with her heart”. Yenny Wahid, a prominent Indonesian activist for women’s rights and director of the Wahid Institute, said Ardern’s decision carried an important message for the next generation of leaders. “She chose the timing of her own exit, she has different priorities at this point in her life. It shows the young generation that it’s OK.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-says-south-china-sea-tensions-keep-him-up-day-night/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Even as the Philippines and China seek a “golden age” in their relationship, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said tensions in the South China Sea occupy his mind during most of the day. “Keeps you up at night, keeps you up in the day, keeps you up most of the time. It’s something… It’s very dynamic. It’s constantly in flux. So you have to pay attention to it and to make sure that you are at least aware of the present situation so that you’re able to respond properly,” said Marcos on Wednesday, January 18, in a long conversation with World Economic Forum (WEF) President Børge Brende in Davos. Brende asked the Philippine President if the situation in the contested South China Sea – a vast waterway which Beijing claims the near entirety as its own – keeps him up at night. “We have no conflicting claims with China. What we have is China making claims on our territory and that is our — that is how we approach the problem that we find,” Marcos told Brende. The Philippine President also thumbed down the idea of resorting to our armed forces in the context of the conflict. “There is no point in the Philippines building up its armory. First, we are not in an economic situation that we are able to build up to the levels that the Americans had, to the levels that the Chinese have and more importantly perhaps is our abiding belief that the solutions are not going to be military,” he said. “And if they are going to be military, then they are not solutions because this will — it will end badly if it goes that way. It will end badly for everyone involved. And even those who are not involved,” he added. Manila and Beijing have had a nebulous relationship dating back to the ’70s when diplomatic ties were established during the presidency of dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, the father and namesake of the incumbent president. In recent decades, these ties have gone through dramatic swings. Manila drew close to Beijing in the decade of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s administration through controversial deals. The relationship was strained during the term of the late president Benigno Aquino III, whose administration took China to the international court over a maritime dispute in the South China Sea. Former president Rodrigo Duterte made a loud and big fuss over the country’s supposed pivot to China, although most of the pledges to the Philippines remained unkept promises until the end of his term in 2022. Marcos has adopted a “friend to all, enemy to none” foreign policy. And when it comes to the Philippine exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, Marcos says there is no conflict. In 2016 though, the Philippines won its arbitration case against China in the South China Sea dispute as decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, Netherlands. Marcos made a state visit to Beijing, his first outside of Southeast Asia, in early January 2023. In his bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Marcos brought up the South China Sea while emphasizing that territorial disputes do not make the “totality” of Manila and Beijing’s ties. “I would not be doing my job if I did not bring up these issues with President Xi when I had the opportunity,” he said. Several countries, including those in Southeast Asia, have conflicting claims with China in parts of the expansive waterway. The Philippines calls the portion under its exclusive economic zone the West Philippine Sea, even as China continues to establish control over those same parts. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China have agreed on creating a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea but 10 years on, talks have failed to go beyond the agreement that a code should be in place. China is among the Philippines’ largest trading partners. – Rappler.com"

That followed Wednesday’s exit of top seed Rafa Nadal, who already holds 22 Grand Slam singles titles. It could turn out that Djokovic’s left thigh, again heavily strapped against a hamstring niggle, will be the biggest obstacle to him landing yet another Australian Open title. The 35-year-old took a medical timeout at 4-4 in the second set to have the strapping changed and fiddled with it at changeovers but otherwise appeared largely unhindered by the injury. Couacaud also needed treatment when he turned his ankle nastily in the first set as he tried in vain to hold off a break of serve that gave his opponent a 3-1 lead. The Mauritius-born 27-year-old continued to throw everything at Djokovic and played a brilliant second set, finally coming back from 3-0 down to take the tiebreak 7-5. Djokovic was again warmly supported by the crowd, the acrimony of his deportation from Australia last year over his stance on vaccinations against COVID-19 apparently forgotten. One fan attracted his ire in the fourth set, however, after repeatedly making noise while Djokovic was preparing to serve. “He’s drunk out of his mind, he’s provoking, he’s not here to watch tennis, what are you going to do about it?” he asked the umpire. Four men in fancy dress were subsequently escorted from the arena and Djokovic was soon crunching a howitzer of a crosscourt backhand winner to bring an end to the contest. Alexander Zverev slumped out of the Australian Open in the second round at the hands of American Michael Mmoh also on Thursday, fulfilling the low expectations he had about his trip to Melbourne Park. The 25-year-old’s 2022 season lasted until the semifinal of the French Open against Rafa Nadal, when he suffered an ankle injury that would sideline him for months. A bone edema kept him off the court for the remainder of the season and he arrived in Australia with a realistic view about his chances of going deep in the year’s first Grand Slam. He had to come back from two sets to one down to beat Peruvian Juan Pablo Varillas in the opening round on Tuesday but overcoming a second lucky loser on Thursday was beyond him and Mmoh joined an American charge into the third round. “I didn’t have any expectations. I didn’t have any goals, and it was a good test for me,” Zverev told reporters after the 6-7(1), 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 defeat. “I played a five-setter, and I know where I am physically. That’s about it. I guess I still have a long way back to where I was.” Zverev, runner up at the 2020 US Open and No. 2 in the world last year, said he had fully recovered from his injuries but still had a way to go to get back to full fitness. “My foot is healthy, but I’m not at the physical level that I was,” he said. “I’m not as fast. Definitely my conditioning is not as good as it was. So I think I still have a long way to go to there.” Zverev kicked off his season at the United Cup team competition, losing both of his matches, but said his time in Australia had given him some encouragement. “I think the last weeks I was getting better and better, and that is something very positive for me,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/reviews/honor-x9a-5g-review/,['GELO GONZALES'],"(Disclosure: Honor lent a unit for this review. ) MANILA, Philippines – The Honor X9a 5G is affordable at P16,990 but it feels more expensive than it is, and there’s one simple reason: its beautiful display. It features a 120Hz refresh rate, meaning scrolling is doubly smoother than regular 60Hz phones, and uses an OLED panel for the crisp, vivid color that we’d mostly come to expect from more expensive phones. The display is curved too, which makes you feel like you’re holding one of those curved flagships of yore from Samsung, only lighter and thinner. It has a slim 20:9 aspect ratio (2,400 x 1,080 resolution), that makes it both sexy, and more ergonomically pleasing to hold. While pretty, Honor is also heavily marketing the display’s toughness, encouraging tech reviewers to do their own stress or drop tests. We haven’t dropped the phone, intentionally or unintentionally, in our time using it, but seeing Honor put the phone display’s toughness front and center in its campaign, feels reassuring. The X9a, to me, just highlights how significant a role the screen plays in making a phone feel premium. It’s a treat for the eyes, and you can get it without having to break the bank. It’s great too that Honor decided to use an aluminum frame for the phone to keep up with the display’s premium appearance. The back of the phone isn’t as premium with its use of a polycarbonate plastic material, but the textured finish that shifts from hues of grayish green and blue does a commendable job of keeping up with the phone’s premium-looking aspirations. You know it’s plastic, but it’s good-looking plastic. Helping it stand out as well is the eye-catching circle camera array placed in the top-center, reminiscent of Huawei’s flagship phones. It’s certainly a unique-looking setup, but whether you actually like the circular orientation or not is up to personal taste. While the display is great, the mono speakers at the bottom are weak, and sound pretty thin. It’s best to use earphones with this one. With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695G – a commendable mid-range chip – and 8GB of RAM, the X9a 5G is a suitable daily driver, breezing through most daily tasks. For gaming though, you might have to turn down settings to low in most games to get 60 frames per second. More demanding games like Genshin Impact might be hard to run smoothly on the phone, but less demanding ones such as Mobile Legends would perform well. I like that it comes with 256GB instead of 128GB, especially considering it doesn’t have expandable storage. The battery life is excellent on the X9a thanks to its large 5,100 mAh battery, and a chip that’s been known to be relatively efficient. It lasts long, and can run for up to two days of regular use minus heavy Netflix streaming. I’ve used it regularly as a WiFi hotspot for an entire workday working remotely, and I’m pleasantly surprised at how much battery life is left at the end of the day. Charging is not the fastest at 40 watts, and is slower than its predecessor’s X9’s 66-watt charging. It’s still fast enough that I can get enough juice for the day with a quick charge if I’ve neglected to charge it. The phone is average when it comes to its cameras (16MP main, 5MP wide, 2MP macro). Photos look great when there is great lighting, but looks par for the course in average lighting, especially with indoor lighting, and struggles in poor lighting. On the front is a standard 16MP selfie camera that produces average results. That’s the trade-off here. You get an amazing user experience because of the display and the battery, but the cameras are clearly not the selling point here. 

If your priority is a phone that looks good, feels premium to use and look at with a vivid, smooth curved display, but has average photo and video capabilities, give the X9a a try. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/sss-implements-contribution-rate-hikes-january-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Social Security System (SSS) started implementing on January 2023 a higher members’ contribution rate of 14%, up from 13% the previous year. This rise in both employers’ and employees’ shares of the contribution rate is part of a series of increases touched off by the enactment of Republic Act 11199, or the Social Security Act of 2019, which was signed into law by former president Rodrigo Duterte. Under the new rate, the share of employers will be hiked by one percentage point, making their monthly contribution now at 9.5%. Meanwhile, the employee’s share of contribution of those earning P25,000 or less monthly will remain at 4.5%. Under RA 11199, the contribution rate is scheduled to increase every two years from 2019 to 2025 as follows. The next rate increase, slated to take effect in January 2025, will raise members’ contribution to 15%. According to SSS President and Chief Executive Officer Rolando Ledesma Macasaet, raising the contribution rate periodically is necessary to preserve the financial viability of the state pension fund. “The contribution hike will benefit the workers with the SSS being able to provide a financially viable social protection system to Filipino workers and their families,” Macasaet said. He also emphasized that the increase will be borne by employers, not workers. “It will not be a burden on workers, but will be shouldered by employers. Workers earning less than P25,000 per month, who comprise 78% of SSS-paying employee members, will not be affected,” he added. Employers may also deduct their share of the monthly contribution from their taxable income, which Macaset hopes will act as a form of tax relief for employers. Meanwhile, employer groups – including the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP), and the Philippine Exporters Confederation Inc. (PECI) – have asked SSS to suspend the increase to the monthly contributions. The state pension fund, however, has denied these requests, stating that postponements would endanger the actuarial life of the fund. “The contribution hike will not be paid by the lowly worker but by financially-stable employers who can afford such adjustments. I am appealing to the PCCI, the ECOP, and the PECI, who we consider our valuable partners in our mission to provide social protection to our workers, to treat the contribution hike not as another operational expense but as a noble investment to ensure the viability of the workers’ pension fund,” Macasaet said. SSS previously said that the gradual contribution rate increases since 2019 have extended the fund’s life by 22 years. – Rappler.com"

Besides meeting with the US president and other Cabinet officials, Marcos was able to strike potential deals in military assets, a trade and investment mission, technology, health, and power, among others. (READ: What you need to know: Commitments made during Marcos and Biden’s bilateral meeting) Including his current trip to the United Kingdom (UK) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia right after, he will have taken 10 trips as president. In all these trips so far, Marcos has been accompanied by First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos and family members who are elected officials. Let’s take a look at the countries Marcos has visited so far. His first set of international trips brought him to Indonesia and Singapore (counted as one trip), from September 4 to 7, 2022. During his visit to Indonesia, he signed a joint plan of action between the two nations, as well as agreements in the fields of defense and security, creative economy, and cultural cooperation. (LIST: Deals from Marcos’ Indonesia trip) His trip to Singapore bore agreements on counter-terrorism efforts, information technology, property development, data privacy, and water collaboration. (LIST: Deals Marcos gov’t signed in Singapore) The Philippines and Singapore also signed a joint communiqué on hiring Filipino healthcare workers. Investments signed during the trips total P804.78 billion, according to Marcos. In both countries, Marcos met with Filipino communities there the day he arrived. Marcos made his international debut in New York in the United States during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 21, 2022 (September 20, New York Time). In his 20-minute speech, Marcos talked about the country’s bid for a seat in the UN Security Council, and expressed his commitment to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Climate change, food security, and the war in Ukraine were also taken up in his speech. Marcos met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, US President Joe Biden, ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and different business and economic groups. He also watched an Eric Clapton concert and the Broadway show Into the Woods during the trip. Marcos and his family made a surprise visit to the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix on October 2, 2022. Claiming that the visit also involved work, officials neither confirmed nor denied the trip until a few days after. He had reportedly met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr., as well as other government officials from Singapore, Cambodia, and Saudi Arabia. Marcos was in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, from November 9 to 13, 2022, for the 40th and 41st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit. Besides the summit, he held bilateral meetings with Brunei as well as South Korea and talked with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. It was also during the Summit that the different member-states released a five-point consensus on the unrest in Myanmar, as well as agreeing “in principle” on the membership of Timor-Leste in the ASEAN. He met with the Filipino community in Cambodia after the Summit, on November 13. His next trip came a few days after, this time for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Week in Bangkok from November 16 to 19, 2022. Marcos focused on food security, pandemic readiness, and climate change. Marcos had the opportunity to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron. In December, the President headed to Brussels, Belgium, for the ASEAN-European Union Summit. Marcos met with different European leaders and discussed topics like climate change, seafarer welfare, and trade. (FACT CHECK: Marcos Jr. didn’t meet Belgian King to withdraw $987 billion) Marcos’ first trip of 2023 was a state visit to China from January 3 to 5. The trip led to an agreement between the two countries to establish official communication lines to resolve disputes over the West Philippine Sea. Thirteen other agreements were signed, including bilateral deals on tourism, trade, and information. The World Economic Forum, running from January 15 to 20 in Davos, Switzerland, was a gathering of economic and business leaders, along with heads of state and other government officials to discuss how to address global issues, as well as learn practices in leadership and management. The forum, however, has been criticized for serving only as an elitist platform, with no concrete resolutions carried out after. The Philippine delegation reportedly had 70 people, according to Vera Files. Marcos visited Japan from February 8 to 12. In an official working visit at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida, the countries inked deals in the fields of defense and security, infrastructure, and agriculture. The Philippine President also marketed “highly-skilled” seafarers who are ready to work with Japanese shipping companies. “When you think growth, think Philippines,” Marcos said in a forum in Japan. On his second visit to the US from April 30 to May 4, 2023, Marcos, in an official working visit, had bilateral talks with US President Biden at the White House. Aside from deals in military, infrastructure, and technology, Marcos pitched the idea of reinstating the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, which allows duty-free exports of specific products to the US. The Philippines’ inclusion in the deal expired in December 2020. Marcos arrived in the UK on May 5, for the King Charles III coronation ceremony on May 6.  – Rappler.com (Disclaimer: We count the trips according to the number of times he exits the country, not the number of countries visited.)"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/gerald-bantag-faces-new-suspension-smni-interview-jovito-palparan-january-2023/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gerald Bantag was handed another suspension for allowing Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) to interview retired general and convicted kidnapper Jovito Palparan inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP). In an order issued on Tuesday, January 17, but sent to reporters on Thursday, January 19, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said the suspended BuCor chief faces an administrative investigation for grave misconduct and neglect in the performance of duty. According to the justice department, Bantag allegedly committed the following violations when he allowed SMNI, owned by fugitive preacher Apollo Quiboloy, to interview Palparan: Bantag’s new suspension is for 90 days without pay and took effect immediately. He was ordered to file his response to the administrative charges within 10 days. Rappler has asked the DOJ whether SMNI would have any liabilities if it is proven that the interview violated BuCor rules. The justice department has yet to respond as of writing. Bantag was already suspended as early as October 2022 for the deaths of broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa and inmate Jun Villamor, the alleged middleman in Lapid’s killing. Aside from criminal complaints in relation to the deaths of Lapid and Villamor, Bantag is also facing another set of both criminal and administrative complaints for allegedly stabbing gang leaders inside the national penitentiary. Based on the DOJ’s memorandum, SMNI sent a letter of request to interview Palparan on November 15, 2021, and Bantag approved the request. Over four months later, on March 30, 2022, SMNI conducted the interview at the NBP’s Minimum Security Compound. After the airing of the SMNI interview, the DOJ launched a probe because Palparan was supposedly interviewed without the knowledge of prosecutors and the court. In April 2022, the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers filed a petition before the Court of Appeals to hold in contempt of court those behind the interview. The justice department then said in June 2022 that based on its initial investigation, there were lapses when BuCor allowed the SMNI interview with Palparan. Palparan was convicted of kidnapping and serious illegal detention over the disappearance of students Karen Empeño and Sherlyn Cadapan. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. – Rappler.com"

Filipino star center Kai Sotto provided an early spark with 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting, 7 rebounds, and 2 blocks in under 16 minutes as a starter, but was again reduced to a spectator in the clutch as Antonius Cleveland sank the overtime-forcing free throws to knot up Adelaide with Brisbane, 91-all. Although Cleveland got the ball rolling in the extra period with an early go-ahead layup for the 93-91 lead, the Bullets zoomed past with a crucial 8-1 run, capped by an Andrew White floater with 1:51 left, 99-94. Adelaide got as close as 99-98 off a Cleveland and-one conversion with 1:21 remaining, but Cleveland’s heroics were immediately erased after he committed back-to-back turnovers that translated to a game-sealing 5-0 spurt by the home team, 104-98, with 32.7 ticks left. The Sixers momentarily gave the Bullets a scare after former NBA guard Tyler Johnson bricked two free throws that Anthony Drmic turned to a quick pull-up three opportunity, 101-104, with 13.5 seconds left. However, Johnson made up for his earlier blunder with a pair of charities off the duty foul at the 12.9-second mark to set the final score and seal the upset win. Johnson led the way with 27 points off the bench on 9-of-18 shooting with 6 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 steals, while Jason Cadee paced the starters with 22 points in just under 26 minutes.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/workers-trafficked-crypto-scam-hostaged-after-rescue-cambodia/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – Senator Risa Hontiveros exposed a report of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) allegedly forced to participate in the cryptocurrency scam in Cambodia, later rescued by police, but were then made to stay at two police stations at least where they reported missing money, according to the senator’s reports as of Thursday, January 19. Hontiveros first raised the issue in a Senate hearing on Wednesday, January 18. Filipinos were duped into working in Cambodia for a cryptocurrency scam, where they befriended victims before advising them to invest money into the scam. One of the Filipinos known as “Miles” said that they were made to work up to 16 hours, seven days a week – especially if they could not get people to scam. Miles witnessed her co-worker get electrocuted by their reportedly Chinese employers. In a video interview with Hontiveros’ office, Miles said she flew to Thailand and went to Cambodia via van in October 2022, and worked in Kep province. She returned to the Philippines on January 16, and reached out to Hontiveros as there were remaining Filipinos in Cambodia who needed to be rescued. In November 2022, Hontiveros also exposed a report of OFWs trafficked to Myanmar to perform the same exact cryptocurrency scam. She alleged that a Chinese mafia was behind the operation. The Filipinos, both in Myanmar and Cambodia, were lured out of the country through job offers on social media to be call center agents. Filipinos who went to Myanmar each paid Philippine immigration officers up to P20,000 to let them slip through. Miles also spoke of an “escort” from Philippine immigration that allowed them easy travel to the dubious job destination. On Wednesday, Hontiveros said that the Filipinos who were in Miles’ group had been rescued by Cambodian police on Monday, January 16, because of an intervention from the Philippine embassy in Phnom Penh. However, as of Tuesday evening, January 17, “they are being held at a police station without beds and basic facilities.” Hontiveros said she wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to facilitate their swift repatriation. The DFA on Thursday said that it was working on the repatriation of OFWs who fell victim to human trafficking in Southeast Asia. On Thursday, Hontiveros released another video with an OFW called “Buddy,” who described the group of Filipinos’ experience moving from one police station to another after being rescued on Monday. Buddy said that cops at Kampot Police Station asked about their situation with their Chinese employers. Police also asked if they had money, and the Filipinos said they had none. Buddy said the group had some money for their needs, but they were unsure how to to answer the question. The police had them sleep in the same room they were interviewed, but their cell phones were taken from them overnight, Buddy said. The cell phones were returned in the morning, and the group was told to get ready to be transported via van to the Philippine embassy. Cops asked the group for gas money, and Buddy said they gathered around 100,000 Cambodian riel (around P1,327) to give to them. Buddy said that two of the OFWs in the group discovered missing cash from their cell phone cases. One had “Kuwait money, Khmer money, and $10,” while the other lost $200. They made the missing money known to the cops, but brushed it off so they could leave. The group was brought to a second police station near the Philippine embassy. Buddy said more OFWs discovered missing money amounting to hundreds of dollars from their wallets which were inside their bags. “Sinabi namin doon sa mga pulis na kasama namin na nawawala, ngunit ang kanilang sagot, noong tinanong daw po kami noong gabi sa Kampot Police Station kung may pera kami, sumagot daw po kami ng wala. ‘Yun lang po ang nangyari,” Buddy said. (We told the police that we had missing cash, but their response to us was, when they asked us at Kampot Police Station if we had money, we said we didn’t have any. That’s what happened.) Buddy said after Hontiveros’ office was informed of their situation, food and things they needed came “immediately.” In a Thursday statement that accompanied the video of Buddy, Hontiveros said, “It is an outrage that those victimized by trafficking are hostages yet again by various constraints.” The senator thanked the Philippine embassy for its interventions, but reiterated her call to the DFA to facilitate the speedy repatriation of the OFWs detained in Phnom Penh. Hontiveros said she would raise the issue of the DFA’s Assistance to Nationals funding in the “next” Senate hearing. “We have the funds, why are we not using them to save our citizens as quickly as possible? Kung may legal na gusot, hindi ba may legal assistance fund din na galing sa gobyerno para sa mga Pilipino sa labas ng bansa?” she said. (If there are legal issues, don’t we also have a legal assistance fund from the government as well for overseas Filipinos?) Hontiveros also thanked the Filipinos in Cambodia her office reached out to, who helped give food, blankets, and other forms of help to the group of OFW survivors. On Thursday, Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said that the DFA was “aware” of the numerous cases of OFWs being promised non-existent jobs in certain countries, only to be forced to work in illegal operations like online scamming. “The Department, through its embassies and in cooperation with local authorities, is working to bring home our nationals from places such as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar,” the DFA said. The DFA reiterated its call for Filipinos to be vigilant, and follow regular deployment procedures through the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) before accepting and leaving for jobs abroad. The DMW has yet to issue a statement on the newest case of OFW trafficking to Cambodia for crypto scamming. On Tuesday, January 17, Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco relieved two of the BI’s personnel following reports of their alleged involvement in trafficking activities at the Clark International Airport (CIA), and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Miles had said she left the country through NAIA, while some other Filipinos she knew in Cambodia exited through the CIA. “We have received information that the two have links to trafficking syndicates…. We are initiating an investigation to verify this information, and if there is indeed probable cause, we shall file the appropriate case before the Department of Justice,” said Tansingco. The BI said that as a preventive measure, the two will be temporarily assigned to back-end office duties, pending the investigation. “This is a continuing investigation and we will also look into the role of recruiters in these human trafficking activities. If there are names of recruiters that will come out from the investigation then we will refer it to the proper investigating agency under the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking,” said BI spokesperson Dana Sandoval. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla backed the BI’s investigation. “It is already under investigation even before several names came out,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Fact-finding investigation about this human trafficking to Cambodia is ongoing. We haven’t stopped trying to find out and going to the bottom of the facts. We have to know how deep it went,” Remulla said. – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/social-media-reactions-hbo-the-last-of-us-premiere/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – HBO’s The Last of Us, an adaptation of Naughty Dog’s celebrated video game, premiered on Monday, January 16, Philippine time, and, true to expectations, it made viewers emotional. The much-anticipated series has received universal praise from critics, with a 99% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, as of writing. Rappler’s Carljoe Javier in his review lauds how the series “is committed not necessarily to the specifics of its source material, but rather to its thematic aspirations.” He added that based on the first episode alone, it has the potential to be “a truly standout series that shows that there’s still a lot of life in the zombie genre.” The general audience doesn’t always agree with critics, however. But for The Last of Us, there doesn’t appear to be a disconnect between the two groups. The premiere has managed to wow everyone, including fans of the game, who are raving about how faithful it is to the beloved PlayStation classic. For those unfamiliar, The Last of Us is a post-apocalyptic drama that takes place twenty years after a fungal virus has ravaged humanity, turning those who get infected into primitive zombies (if you can call them that). Joel, played by Pedro Pascal, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, out of a military quarantine zone. What starts out as a small job soon becomes a brutal cross-country journey that pushes the two protagonists to depend on each other for survival. While fans of the game likely already have a good idea of what transpires through that journey, it didn’t stop them from once again being moved with how the series wonderfully sets up the emotional arcs of Joel and Ellie. Even those who haven’t played the game couldn’t help but be swept up thanks to the strong performances of the two lead actors, who bring their respective characters’ trauma and grief to life. Here are some of the reactions to the premiere – do be warned though, SPOILERS ahead: Many Twitter users shared how much they loved the first episode, with one even hailing it as the “best video game adaptation we’ve ever seen.” Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively, got plenty of love. Twitter user @gurlnico praised Nico Parker’s performance as Sarah, Joel’s daughter. There were some fans of the game who jokingly lamented how they have to relive the story’s heartbreaking events again – this time in live action. Another Twitter user, meanwhile, said the scene towards the end of the episode that sees Joel beat a FEDRA officer to death, with Ellie looking on – a scene that plays out differently in the game – adds more “depth” to their characters. (Looking forward a ton, we wonder how some scenes in the shocking sequel will turn out in the series, and how new TV audiences will react to those.) Other Twitter users shared comparisons between scenes from the show and the game, showing how similar they are. The Last of Us is a nine-part series, with a new episode coming each week until March 13, Philippine time. The next episode drops on Monday, January 23, Philippine time. – Rappler.com"

Messi’s Paris St. Germain take on a combined Al Hilal-Al Nassr team in an exhibition match, giving Ronaldo and Messi a chance to rekindle their old ‘El Clasico’ rivalry when they played for Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. With nothing for Messi left to prove in Europe or on the international stage, there is also speculation that Al Hilal want to bring the 35-year-old to Saudi Arabia when his PSG contract expires at the end of the season. Mohammed Al-Jadaan, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Finance, had recently indicated that the door was open for moves by Saudi clubs to try and sign both of soccer’s biggest stars. “Well we talked about that before and the quality of life is a critical part of the 2030 vision and quality of life in Saudi has improved, sports is a significant part of that,” he told CNBC when asked about Ronaldo or Messi moving to the country. “The young population of Saudi watch sports and perform sports and anything we can do to enhance this industry will pay back and improve the quality of life not only for our people but for the working people from outside.” Messi and Ronaldo won every Ballon d’Or award from 2008-2017 until Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric broke their hegemony and the Argentine has since won two more to lead 7-5 over his Portuguese rival in the race to be the world’s best player. When the pair first faced off in 2008 as young upstarts looking to make their mark, Manchester United and Barcelona played out a 0-0 draw in the Champions League. Since then they have never both been involved in a goalless draw for their clubs and national teams in memorable matches with millions tuning in to witness the greats in their prime. The spotlight was on the pair at the World Cup in Qatar last year but whereas Ronaldo faded and was left out of Portugal’s starting lineup in the knockout stages as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals, Messi went on to lift the trophy. Messi became the first player ever to score in every round at a World Cup and finished with seven goals as he completed his trophy collection and was named player of the tournament. Should the Argentine move to Saudi Arabia, Thursday’s encounter between the sport’s two biggest stars of the modern era could signal the dawn of a new age in Asian football. – Rappler.com"

At a press briefing on Thursday, January 19, Senate blue ribbon chairman Francis Tolentino said that the Sandiganbayan will advise how the P979 million would be collected from the DepEd and the Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) which procured the laptops on the behalf of the education department. “Trabaho ng Sandiganbayan ‘yan (That’s the work of the Sandiganbayan.) How to do that, ‘yung forfeiture, how to garnish, how to check the bank accounts. Ang nakalagay naman doon solidarily liable, so mag ambag ambag sila para maabot ‘yun (What’s indicated in the report is that they are solidarily liable, so they can pitch in contributions to meet that amount),” Tolentino said. The Senate panel has also recommended the filing of administrative and criminal charges against them. They are the following: “The procurement process for the laptops, intended to support remote learning of students during the pandemic, was conducted by the PS DBM supposedly upon the request and authority of the DepEd. The Committee, however, found that the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed by the DepEd authorizing and delegating the procurement task to PS DBM was antedated which rendered the procurement process questionable and highly irregular,” the Senate panel report added. The recovered amount will be placed in the Special National Teachers Trust Fund to support the health and medical needs of public school teachers and the educational needs of their children. When asked about the liability of the laptop suppliers, Tolentino did not give a direct answer but said it was included in the report. Rappler will update this story once we receive a copy of the Senate blue ribbon committee report.

The PCG said on Thursday, January 19, that an investigation it conducted found that Diño was among the incorporators of the “101ST Balangay PCGA, Incorporated” registered with the Securities Exchange Commission in August 2022, without authorization from the PCG. A complaint for de-registration was since been filed against the group at the SEC, the PCG said. The PCG said it learned about the unauthorized registration upon receiving intelligence reports that a group in Bataan had been claiming to represent the PCG to recruit people and charge fees for membership in their organization. Coast Guard Spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilo said the group also used the PCG’s insignia, uniforms, and ranks to carry out an induction ceremony. Apart from this, the PCG said Diño’s group also falsely claimed that senior PCG officials, including Commandant Artemio Abu, sanctioned its activities. The groups’ actions, Balilo said, suggested to the public that it was a legitimate part of the PCG and PCGA. “They have to respect the PCG as an armed organization and preserve the sanctity of wearing the uniform,” he said. Along with Diño, the PCG named the other incorporators of the company as Renante Nase, Agustin Soria Jr., Laurence Nase, Reniel Nase, Jerry delos Santos, and Christine Lingat. Diño, a self-styled anti-drugs, anti-corruption crusader and supporter of former president Rodrigo Duterte, was appointed to the DILG in 2018. It was also Diño who previously filed his candidacy for president during the 2016 elections, only for him to withdraw and nominate Duterte as the substitute standard-bearer of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan. Aside from a complaint filed with the SEC, the PCG also filed cases of “estafa, usurpation of authority, and unlawful use of logo and insignias” against Diño and his group at the Bataan Provincial Prosecutor’s office in Balanga City. The PCG’s station in Bataan said the group managed to recruit some 500 residents, 50 them joining the PCG in filing the complaint. Under the Revised Penal Code, unauthorized use of the PCG or PCGA’s names, uniforms, logos, and insignias is a criminal offense. The PCG said it warned Diño and the company’s other incorporators that it get the help of the police to arrest them if they continued to misrepresent the PCG and solicit funds from the public. “They have been warned accordingly,” Balilo said. – Rappler.com"

In a media release on Thursday, January 19, the SWS said the 11.8% Hunger Rate in the Philippines captured in their December 2022 survey was slightly higher than both the 11.3% hunger rate in October 2022 and 11.6% in June 2022. The two most recent hunger rates, recorded by SWS during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., were slightly lower than the 12.2% hunger rate recorded in April 2022, the last such poll it conducted during the administration of then-president Rodrigo Duterte. In the latest survey, the hunger rate was highest in Mindanao at 12.7%, followed by Visayas at 12.0%, Metro Manila at 11.7%, and Balance Luzon at 11.3%. “The 0.5-point increase in Overall Hunger between October 2022 and December 2022 was due to increases in the Visayas and Balance Luzon, combined with decreases in Metro Manila and Mindanao,” SWS said. Out of the three million families who experienced hunger, 599,000 families experienced “severe hunger” while the rest experienced “moderate hunger.” 1,200 respondents, aged 18 and above, participated in the nationwide fourth-quarter survey of the SWS which were conducted through face-to-face interviews. The pollster interviewed 300 respondents each in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The respondents were asked the question, “In the last three months, did it happen even once that your family experienced hunger and not have anything to eat?” Inflation had soared to 8.1% – the highest since November 2008 – at the time the SWS conducted the survey for hunger. A survey conducted in October 2022 by OCTA Research showed that around 36% of adult Filipinos were dissatisfied with the response of the Marcos administration to inflation. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/topex-robinson-named-dlsu-green-arches-head-coach/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Seasoned head coach and former professional basketball player Topex Robinson has been named the new head coach of De La Salle Green Archers, the university announced on Thursday, January 19. Robinson was one of the frontrunners for the job throughout the interview process and was eventually selected over veteran tactician Luigi Trillo in the final stages of La Salle’s search for a mentor to take over the men’s basketball program after the expiration of former head coach Derrick Pumaren’s contract last December 31. The 48-year-old Robinson agreed to a three-year contract as the Green Archers look to revive their basketball glory and return to the UAAP Final Four next season. Robinson, whose last coaching gig was with Phoenix in the PBA, sought the opportunity to coach the Green Archers with so much enthusiasm that he allowed the deadline of his decision to re-sign with Phoenix pass despite not having a guarantee that he would be hired by La Salle. In a previous conversation with Rappler, Robinson called it a “dream of mine” to coach the Green Archers. Trillo, who is currently an assistant coach with Meralco also in the PBA, gained momentum as a candidate this week as certain decision-makers valued his track record of success, which includes a PBA title in 2013 with Alaska, and ties to the La Salle community. Trillo played for DLSU from 1993-1996 and his father, Joaqui Trillo, was a former head coach of the Green Archers. But ultimately the choice was Robinson, who vocalized his plans for DLSU’s roster and willingness to coach the team early in the search. Given Robinson’s ability to develop relationships with student-athletes and his success in the NCAA with Lyceum and San Sebastian, he was an appealing choice. Coaches Jeff Cariaso and Louie Alas also applied for the position while there were preliminary conversations to gauge whether there would be interest from foreign coaching options such as Brian Goorjian, Bill Tomlinson, Nenad Vucinic, and Rajko Toroman that didn’t progress far. The Green Archers have been back in practice working on their strength and conditioning under coaches Gian Nazario and Mon Jose, both of whom are expected to be part of Robinson’s staff, along with women’s team head coach Cholo Villanueva. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-confident-philippines-resist-recessionary-forces-world-economic-forum-davos-2023/,[],"Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said his economy would resist global recessionary headwinds, but warned that increasing tensions in the South China Sea were harming trade. Marcos was bullish about the country’s economic prospects in a speech on Wednesday, January 18, at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, which has been dominated by talk of an impending global recession brought on by the cost of living and energy crises. “My belief is that as long as the unemployment rate stays low, we will be able to resist the recessionary forces,” he said. He said the upskilling of his country’s labor force was powering the economic growth, including remittances from overseas workers. But increasing tensions in the South China Sea were affecting trade on all of the exchanges in the region, he said. “The future of the region has to be decided by the region, not outside powers,” he said. Earlier, Marcos said he expects the domestic economy to grow around 7% this year, saying strong fundamentals, prudent fiscal management and reforms in key sectors will cushion against risks from a potential global recession. The Southeast Asian country, which will announce its 2022 economic performance on January 26, also expects last year’s gross domestic product growth to be faster than the 6.5%-7.5% target. “Our strong macroeconomic fundamentals, fiscal discipline, structural reforms and liberalization of key sectors instituted over the years have enabled us to withstand the negative shocks caused by the pandemic and succeeding economic downturns and map a route toward a strong recovery,” Marcos was quoted as saying in a statement his office issued on Wednesday. Marcos said the Philippine economy’s growth is thanks to the micro, small and medium enterprises in the country. His administration, said Marcos, “concentrated on the MSMEs…because that comprises such a large part of our economy and it’s the same in most ASEAN countries.” He’s also said keeping unemployment low is key to surviving the threat of a global economic slump. “My theory, my belief, and I think I’m right in that is that, as long as the unemployment rate stays low, then the recessionary forces are something that we can resist,” he said. Marcos was in Davos, Switzerland this week for the World Economic Forum, accompanied by his economic team and several Philippine business executives. There he met with potential investors to seek support for his infrastructure development program. Pent-up domestic demand following the removal of pandemic restrictions propped up economic growth last year and will continue supporting consumer spending this year, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Felipe Medalla said on January 10. “Our actual projection is 6.5 (percent for 2023) but there are signs that we might be able to surpass that,” Marcos said in Davos, where he also presented his proposed sovereign wealth fund to potential investors. Critics have raised concerns over the transparency and governance of the wealth fund, which has been approved by the House of Representatives, and is pending deliberation in the Senate. Under the bill, state lenders Development Bank of the Philippines and Land Bank of the Philippines would provide a total P75 billion ($1.37 billion) for initial capital, while the central bank will contribute subsequently through dividends. – with reports from Bea Cupin/Rappler.com"

Nane Danlag, the head of the seismic station of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) in General Santos, said on Thursday, January 19, that the epicenter of the earthquake was located more than 300 kilometers off the tip of Mindanao, in Indonesian waters, and was traced at a depth of 64 kilometers. Danlag added that such earthquakes usually produce weak intensities. Graybert Malinog, anti-disaster and rescue officer of Sarangani town, Davao Occidental, said no one was hurt and there was no damage in the town. The earthquake was felt at intensity 2 in General Santos and prompted residents and workers to seek shelter in safer places. “The ground shook. Who will not run?” Esther Pasmita, a storekeeper in General Santos, said. Although the earthquake was technically an “Indonesian earthquake,” Phivolcs still plotted the tremor and reported it as it was felt in some parts of Mindanao, said Danlag. Phivolcs initially reported that the earthquake occurred at 2:06 pm on Wednesday with a depth of 40 km, and traced its origin to be 346 kilometers southeast of Balut Island in the town of Sarangani in Davao Occidental. The tremor was also felt at intensity 2 as its peak in several towns in Sarangani province, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and the cities of Koronadal and General Santos. It was felt at intensity 1 in Lake Sebu and Surallah towns in South Cotabato, and Columbio town in Sultan Kudarat.

However, Mavs’ owner Mark Cuban later shot down the report. “Tim MacMahon got it dead wrong. Luka has never suggested, asked, demanded or discussed changes to the roster,” Cuban said. Nevertheless, the Mavs would benefit from adding depth around Luka. He’s carried the team throughout the season and is performing at an MVP-caliber level. Doncic comes into Wednesday night’s affair versus the Hawks averaging just shy of 34 points per game on 50 percent field goal and 35 percent three-point shooting. He’s also averaging 9 rebounds and 9 assists per contest for good measure. Luka Doncic’s shooting efficiency stands out without question. Opposing teams build their entire game plan around limiting the Mavs’ star. He’s no stranger to being double or even triple-teamed. But Luka has consistently found ways to find the bottom of the net.

TMZ also reported that Amy Emmerich, the organization’s CEO, emphasized that an independent party handled the results of the competition. “One of the top four accounting firms in the United States handled the results and verified the process,” Emmerich was quoted as saying. She then described Gabriel as a “strong and dedicated contestant” who became the “rightful Miss Universe.” Per the organization’s statement released to Today, they will choose to focus on “[shining] a light on global women’s empowerment, inclusiveness, diversity, and transformational leadership” instead of these “unfounded statements.” Anne Jakrajutatip, the franchise’s new owner, also took to Instagram to emphasize that the “rules and judges were fair and equitable.” “Each Miss Universe contestant was measured on her own merits in the competition. Not everyone can win the competition but everyone gets an equal chance of winning,” she said. Following Gabriel’s crowning moment at New Orleans, Louisiana, USA on January 14 (morning of January 15 in Manila), many pageant fans complained on social media that the competition favored Miss USA over the other candidates and called Gabriel’s win a “fraud” and the results as “rigged.” Several speculated that it was because USA was the hosting country, and that JKN Global owns both Miss USA and Miss Universe franchises. It can be recalled that Gabriel’s Miss USA win in October 2022 was also embroiled in the same controversy, with the Miss Universe organization even suspending the Miss USA organizers. Emmerich told the Los Angeles Times that the rigging allegations for the Miss USA controversy were “unfounded.” At the time, Gabriel also responded to the speculations, insisting that the Miss USA pageant was not rigged. “I would never enter any pageant or any competition that I know I would win. I have a lot of integrity,” she told E! News. Gabriel took home the ninth Miss Universe crown for the United States.

The 36-year-old had an MRI scan on his left leg in Melbourne on Thursday, which revealed a grade 2 injury in the Illiopsoas, the primary hip flexor. “He will be resting the next days once back in Spain and will start with anti-inflammatory physiotherapy,” his team said in a statement. “The normal time estimated for a complete recuperation is between six and eight weeks.” The 22-time Grand Slam champion arrived in Melbourne with only one win to his name since the US Open after rib, abdomen, and foot injuries kept him off court for much of last season after Wimbledon. “I mean, hopefully it’s nothing too bad.

The 65-year-old performer was reported missing by his wife on Friday evening, January 13, after he had gone hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, according to Los Angeles television station KABC-TV and the Hollywood trade publication Variety. “From what I understand, he left sometime that day for a hike and when he did not return, his family reported him missing,” KABC-TV quoted Gloria Huerta, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department, as telling the news outlet. Ground teams immediately launched a search for the actor but the effort was called off about 24 hours later due to avalanche risks and poor trail conditions, according to Variety, which also cited the sheriff’s department. Intermittent aerial searches by helicopter and drone aircraft have continued, however, and authorities planned to resume a ground search once conditions allow, Variety said. The Baldy Bowl, about 50 miles northeast of Los Angeles just below the Mount Baldy ski area, is a popular destination for skiers, climbers, and hikers. But the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department issued an advisory on Thursday warning that severe winter weather, following weeks of storms that dumped torrential rain and heavy snow across California, has made the area dangerous for outdoor recreation. Over the past four weeks, the sheriff’s search teams have been dispatched on 14 rescue missions on Mount Baldy and surrounding areas for lost or stranded hikers, two of whom perished after falling or injuring themselves, the advisory said.

Diageo, listed on the London Stock Exchange, noted that the acquisition price could go up an extra 177.5 million euros ($191.7 million) through to 2028, subject to the brand’s performance. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2023 and will be funded through existing cash reserves. Diageo has over 200 brands in its portfolio, including Johnnie Walker and Baileys. But it has only one rum brand – Captain Morgan. The British company said the “super-premium plus segment” of the rum category is in the early stages of “premiumization,” or where customers are willing to pay more for a product. The segment had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% in Europe and 27% in the United States between 2016 and 2021. “Through the same period, Don Papa Rum consistently outperformed the market in Europe, delivering a 29% CAGR,” Diageo said. “We are excited by the opportunity to bring Don Papa into the Diageo portfolio to complement our existing rums. This acquisition is in line with our strategy to acquire high-growth brands with attractive margins that support premiumization, and enables us to participate in the fast-growing super-premium plus segment,” added Diageo president for Europe and India John Kennedy. Don Papa Rum was launched in 2012 and was founded by entrepreneur Stephen Carroll, together with Andrew John Garcia. The high-end rum is aged in American oak barrels in Negros Occidental. Its rich texture and taste is due to the Philippines’ tropical climate and local sugarcane. Don Papa Rum is currently sold in 30 countries, with France, Germany, and Italy being its largest markets. Carroll will remain in the company and work alongside Diageo. “They believe in our unique story and have genuinely embraced our brand idea. We believe this acquisition is a great opportunity to take Don Papa into the next exciting chapter of its development,” Carroll said. – Rappler.com $1 = 1.08 euros"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/davao-oriental-exceeds-tourism-target-2022/,[],"DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – Provincial government-run tourism establishments in Davao Oriental generated higher than expected revenues in 2022, marking the start of a full recovery for the local tourism sector battered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement on Wednesday, January 18, Davao Oriental Governor Corazon Malanyaon said ticket sales at the capitol-run eco-parks and museum surpassed their yearly target. “Despite the recent pandemic, arrivals at the province’s premier tourist destinations continue to soar as more visitors are being beguiled by Davao Oriental’s exquisite beauty and charm,” said Malanyaon. Based on data from the Provincial Tourism Office for 2022, the historic Cape San Agustin Eco-Park in Governor Generoso town registered the highest sales at P1.5 million, followed by the Subangan Museum in the City of Mati, Pintatagan Welcome Park in Banaybanay town, Mount Hamiguitan Eco-Park in San Isidro town, and Pusan Point in Caraga town. The Mount Hamiguitan Eco-Park and Pusan Point Eco-Park, which are among the province’s tourism landmarks, have been closed for rehabilitation and renovation in preparation for the provincial government’s “massive tourism relaunch” this year. The capitol said overall ticket sales for 2022 reached P3.8 million while income from other sources like room accommodations, venue rentals, and shares from souvenir shops owned and operated by the provincial government brought in P4.4 million. Last year’s total revenue of more than P8.2 million was more than five times the P1.5-million target set by the provincial government. The capitol, however, said they were still collecting data on the exact number of tourist arrivals in Davao Oriental. The province is home to Mindanao’s only World Heritage Site, the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary, and the world-renowned Pujada, Mayo, and Balite bays. With the influx of tourists, established tourism players in the province are upgrading their facilities to meet the demand, and new resorts, hotels, and similar establishments are rapidly popping up in Davao Oriental. This is due to the area’s unique beauty and lack of saturation compared to other tourist destinations in the country, according to Angie David, a member of the board of trustees of the Davao Oriental Chamber of Commerce and Industry Incorporated. Malanyaon said tourism has been among her administration’s flagship programs as she vowed to invest heavily in a sector that could bring in more revenues to the capitol’s coffers. The governor expects more tourists to visit the province with the scheduled reopening of the upgraded and expanded Mati City airport in the first quarter of 2023. Officials said the Philippine Airlines (PAL), for one, has expressed interest to establish a regular route to f Mati City. “Davao Oriental has what it takes to be a premier tourist destination. We only need more preparation and I hope everybody pitches into this shared vision for our province’s benefit,” said Malanyaon. – Rappler.com"

No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. CHO ended the dynasty of Blacklist International, breaking the almost adamantine code and triumphantly taking home the title of the best Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Team in the world last Jan. 15 in Jakarta, Indonesia. In a clean 4-0 sweep in a best-of-seven series, the Orcas dominated the M4 Championship Grand Finals and decimated the proven-and-tested strategy of Blacklist International. Millions of Filipino fans witnessed the epic showdown of the two teams with the livestream and coverage of Smart, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang’s longtime official telco partner in the Philippines. Blacklist International, the defending champs, had a steady climb from the playoff to the knockout matches, securing the first slot in the grand finals, after defeating ECHO in the upper bracket finals. The boys in purple and white had to face off RRQ Hoshi, branded as the King of Kings of MLBB, trampling over the Indonesian team’s home court, 3-1. It was a rematch not only of the upper bracket finals at the M4 World Championship but also of MPL Philippines Season 10, where Blacklist International reclaimed the crown and strengthened the dynasty it built. However, in an almost unexpected turn of events, the agents had no direct answer as to how they would reverse ECHO’s decoding of their game plan — the Ultimate Bonding Experience (UBE) strategy. So what codes did ECHO break in order to secure a dominating match against the unyielding spirit of Blacklist International? Here are five components of the ECHO Express Strategy that brought them to victory: Blacklist Team Captain Johnmar “OhMyV33nus” Villaluna has always been the focal point on why the UBE Strategy worked for almost two years in a row. Playing the Estes card was the team’s key to victory. In all four games, ECHO respected The Queen and banned Estes from all four games, and in some instances, ECHO gave its roamer Tristan “Yawi” Cabrera signature V33 heroes to further deny her of comfort picks. V33 had repeatedly said during interviews at the M4 stage that not banning her Estes was the downfall of several teams during the tournament. ECHO listened and ECHO won. It seems that the ECHO Express Strategy revolves around the use of massive crowd control skills to enable one or two burst heroes to freely annihilate the opponents. ECHO in all four games always had at least 90 percent of their heroes having massive crowd control skills, prioritizing hero picks such as the Fredrinn, Lolita, Akai, Gloo, Franco, Kaja, and Barats. Karl “Karltzy” Nepumoceno, the first player to ever win the M Series twice, was completely activated as the utility jungle of ECHO in all four matches thanks to the multiple layers of crowd control skills from him and his teammates. This allowed them to secure neutral objectives, pickoff opponents, push turrets and end almost all four games — except for the last one — in under 15 minutes. It is no secret that finding the right targets should be the name of the game, but executing it masterfully is a whole other discussion. In all four games, ECHO rookie experience lane player Sanford “Sanford” Vinuya showed the world how to skillfully prioritize the right target. He is only 16 years old. For instance, in Game 3, his strategic use of Lapu-Lapu’s ultimate after a crucial game-deciding fight at the Lord pit was able to slow down the retreat of four Blacklist star players, including the mid lane artillery mage, gold lane marksman, experience lane fighter, and roamer. With that play, less than 30 seconds later, ECHO closed the match, 3-0. Another crucial moment was in Game 4, when Sanford baited out the enemy jungler with his Gloo. He used this opportunity to dash into the enemy marksman, removing the chance of Blacklist to defend their base and their crown. Another rookie who showed tenacity even at 17 is Alston “Sanji” Pabico, the mid lane mage of ECHO. His explosive use of long-range artillery Yve and Pharsa allowed ECHO to prioritize objectives and pick enemies off due to his commanding presence. But Sanji was not a one-trick pony. He can also be flexible. When both Yve and Pharsa were unavailable for him to use, Sanji went for an assassin mage hero that made its debut in the M4 Stage only at the Grand Finals: Gusion. Sanji’s use of the hero was a masterclass on pickoffs. He finds a triple kill after a successful turtle take, prioritizing low-health opponents and diving into long-range heroes during Game 3. They say victory takes patience and discipline and Benedict “Bennyqt” Gonzales is the epitome of these two essential pro-player characters at the championship match. From diligently farming the gold lane for minutes to get his power spike before joining team fights to pummeling enemies like a thunderstorm, Bennyqt was a force to be reckoned with. He knew he was crucial in the latter parts of the game. Hence, he patiently waited for his correct timings and positioned himself where he could freely hit the enemies. This allowed him to reap the benefits of his late-game heroes Brody and Lunox. In the second match of the series, his hero Brody hid in a bush in the river area in anticipation of a turtle take. He stayed in that position for 33 seconds, resisting the urge to hit enemies that come near his area. In Game 2, when his teammates started to engage, he revealed himself and started hitting enemies with his skills down to his ult and flicker, slaying the enemy marksman, M3 MVP Kiel “Oheb” Soriano, and taking the turtle for his team. If there is one thing that Bennyqt’s patience taught us, it’s that patience may get you the MVP of the whole tournament.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/chris-ford-first-three-pointer-dies/,[],"This story first appeared on ClutchPoints. It was a somber day on Wednesday in the NBA as news broke that former shooting guard Chris Ford had passed away at the age of 74. Today’s NBA game has become heavily perimeter based and consistent three-point shooting is a must for teams. In terms of three-point shooting, Ford helped pave the way for modern day long-range marksmen such as Stephen Curry. He is credited with having made the first recorded three-point shot in NBA history when the league first introduced the three-point line during the 1979-1980 season. Ford played 10 years in the NBA and was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round of the 1972 draft. He played six seasons for the Pistons before being traded to the Boston Celtics. There he played with Larry Bird and was a part of the 1981 championship team. He holds career averages of 9.2 points per game and 46 percent shooting from the field and 37.5 percent shooting from three-point range. After his playing days, Chris Ford became a coach in the league and was an assistant with the Celtics for seven years before serving as head coach from 1990-1995. Following that, he had coaching stints with the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers. He held an overall coaching record of 323-376 in the regular season and 13-16 in the playoffs. He also spent two years as a head coach in the NCAA at the Division III level with Brandeis University. With such a focus on three-point shooting today, players like Stephen Curry can look back at Ford and marvel at the player who set the wheels in motion. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-covid-19-updates-january-19-2023/,[],"BEIJING, China – Chinese drugmakers rushed to make anti-fever medicines and other treatments for COVID-19 on Thursday, January 19, after President Xi Jinping said he was worried about an influx of holiday travelers to rural areas ill-equipped to deal with sudden outbreaks. Xi’s comments come just over a month after his government abruptly axed his strict “zero-COVID” controls that had largely shielded China’s 1.4 billion people from the disease for three years but sparked widespread protests in late November. As travel ramps up during the busy Lunar New Year holiday season, as many as 36,000 people could die each day from the disease, according to the latest forecasts from UK-based health data firm Airfinity. China said last Saturday, January 14, that nearly 60,000 people with COVID had died in hospitals between December 8 and January 12 – a roughly ten-fold increase from previous disclosures. However, that number excludes those who die at home, and some doctors in China have said they are discouraged from putting COVID on death certificates. Health experts say China’s official figures likely do not reflect the true toll of the virus. “Based on the reports of hospitals being overwhelmed and long queues outside funeral homes, we might estimate that a larger number of COVID deaths have occurred so far, maybe more than 600,000 rather than just 60,000,” said Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University. China’s chaotic exit from a regime of mass lockdowns, travel restrictions and frequent COVID testing, has also prompted a run on drugs as people fend for themselves against the disease. To meet soaring demand, drugmakers in China are ramping up operations to triple their capacity to make key fever and cough medicines, the state-run China Daily reported on Thursday. China has relied on domestic vaccines to combat the pandemic, eschewing foreign-made ones which some studies have suggested are more effective, while other foreign treatments for COVID-19 have been hard to come by in China. Pfizer’s COVID-19 anti-viral drug Paxlovid is available in China but has been very difficult to obtain through official channels, according to media reports and personal accounts. Merck & Co’s antiviral treatment molnupiravir has also been approved for use but is not yet widely available. At a meeting this week, China’s National Medical Products Administration pledged to stabilize the prices of COVID-related drugs and crack down on counterfeit sales. Those particularly vulnerable to the virus are the elderly, many of whom are not fully vaccinated and now face exposure as millions of urban workers travel to home towns to reunite with families for Lunar New Year holidays that officially start on January 21. Before COVID first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the holiday was known as the greatest annual migration of people anywhere on the planet. “China’s COVID prevention and control is still in a time of stress, but the light is ahead, persistence is victory,” Xi said on Wednesday, January 18, in a holiday greetings message carried by state broadcaster CCTV. “I am most worried about the rural areas and farmers. Medical facilities are relatively weak in rural areas, thus prevention is difficult and the task is arduous,” Xi said, adding that the elderly were a top priority. Several Chinese cities are set to celebrate the New Year with massive displays of fireworks after local governments reversed bans on their sale in recent years. Hangzhou, Kunming, Zhengzhou, and Changsha – which all have populations above 10 million – will allow the sale of fireworks, according to the Yicai business magazine. Airfinity on Wednesday estimated 62 million people could be infected with the virus between January 13-27 and that COVID-related deaths could peak at 36,000 a day on January 26, up sharply from previous forecasts. “Our forecast estimates a significant burden on China’s healthcare system for the next fortnight and it is likely that many treatable patients could die due to overcrowded hospitals and lack of care,” Airfinity’s analytics director Matt Linley said. Looking beyond the death toll, there is optimism that China’s reopening will reinvigorate a $17 trillion economy suffering one of its lowest growth rates in nearly half a century. China could see a sharp recovery in growth from the second quarter onwards, IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. Those hopes have nudged China’s main stock markets and yuan currency to multi-month highs in recent sessions, although trading was light on Thursday as investors wound down for the holidays. Chinese-controlled Hong Kong, which is trying to revive its finance and trade-reliant economy, said on Thursday it won’t require people with COVID-19 to quarantine from January 30, removing one of its last major virus restrictions. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/mental-health-not-always-good-talk/,[],"Few of us would question the need to break the silence around mental illness. Countless campaigns have drilled into us that such silence is harmful and that we should try to break it wherever we find it. Britain Get Talking is one such campaign. It launched with a splash on Britain’s Got Talent a few years ago when hosts Ant and Dec paused the show for a minute to allow viewers to talk to each other about their mental health. When the minute ended, Ant declared: “See, wasn’t hard, was it?” Doubtlessly, campaigns like this have helped many people open up about their mental health problems, particularly those who have stayed silent because of prejudice and stigma. However, they can also feed misconceptions about silence in mental illness. They imply that silence in and around mental illness is always bad, rooted in fear and stigma, and any effort to break it is good. In fact, silence in mental illness comes in many forms. Some kinds of silence form part of mood disorders like depression. People who have written about their experiences of depression often describe losing their ability to form thoughts and feeling unable to speak. For example, the author Andrew Solomon recalls that he “could not manage to say much.” Elaborating, he writes, “Words, with which I have always been intimate, seemed suddenly very elaborate, difficult metaphors the use of which entailed much more energy than I could possibly muster.” This aspect of depression is well-known in mental health care. Thinking and speaking less are actually considered two different symptoms of depression. Some research even suggests silence is such a reliable symptom that it might be possible to develop automated tools that diagnose depression based on a person’s patterns of speech. If you’re experiencing this sort of “depressed silence,” being confronted with campaigns and people urging you to speak might not help, regardless of their good intentions. After all, the problem isn’t that others aren’t open to what you have to say or that they might react poorly to it. It is that you have nothing to say. Other kinds of silence might be empowering. Some with mental illness are defiantly silent because the people around them ask unwelcome questions or give them unhelpful input. They might wisely choose to save difficult conversations for their therapist. Such a choice isn’t necessarily rooted in stigma. That someone is well-meaning and knows some facts about mental health doesn’t mean they are the right person to talk to about mental illness. Silence in mental illness can also feel good. While some people struggle to think and speak, others struggle with thinking and speaking too much. That might, for example, be the case for someone with bipolar disorder, who experiences episodes of depression as well as mania, which often involves racing thoughts and a compulsion to speak. For such people, moments of peaceful silence can be a hard-won achievement, and sometimes they pay a tragically high price for it. We rarely hear about these other sides of silence in mental illness. But therapists have recognized the role of silence in supporting mental health, at least since Donald Winnicott published his seminal paper “The Capacity to be Alone.” And silence in some form is a key element in meditation, which studies have shown can prevent the recurrence of depression. The silences I have described should perhaps be broken under the right circumstances. Since depressed silence seems to form part of the depressive illness, it may be something the patient has to break with the help of a mental healthcare professional as part of their recovery. Along similar lines, someone might benefit from breaking their peaceful silence in therapy, even if the silence feels good. For whatever reason, many people won’t find those circumstances with their family, friends, or colleagues, despite the encouragement of a celebrity on TV. The fact is that it is very hard to talk about mental health problems, even with people who love and support us. Sometimes that is because of stigma, but sometimes it isn’t. We should, of course, continue to strive to make it easier for people to open up about their mental health problems in the right setting. But we have to get rid of the rhetoric that pressures people to break the silence without regard for why they are silent or if speaking would benefit them. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Dan Degerman is a Research Fellow, University of Bristol.

Markkanen, back after missing two games due to hip issues, scored the first 7 points of the game during a 9-0 Jazz run and proceeded to hit 11-of-20 field goal attempts, 6-of-8 three-point shots and 6-of-6 free throws. A frontrunner for the Most Improved Player award, Markkanen has been averaging 24.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game. Utah, which shot 51.7% from the field and nailed 19-of-32 (59.4%) shots from three-point range, evened its record at 24-24 with its fourth win in five outings. The Jazz won the season series over the Clippers, 3-1. Norman Powell led the shorthanded Clippers with 30 points and Ivica Zubac chipped in 15 points and 12 boards. Los Angeles struggled from the field, shooting 40.2%. Los Angeles, which lost at home to the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night, played without Paul George (rest), Kawhi Leonard (rest), John Wall (abdominal injury), and Luke Kennard (sore calf).

Marcus Morris Sr. scored 4 points in a six-point surge to whittle the Jazz’s lead to single digits at 71-62. Markkanen then fueled another Utah run, following a Kessler bucket with a thunderous dunk over Zubac and then a three-pointer to put Utah ahead, 78-62, with 8:08 to go. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/andren-bernardo-registered-nurse-stand-up-comedian/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – It’s a classic Pinoy conundrum: to fulfill your parents’ wishes, you worked your butt off to become a registered nurse, but there is a nagging – deep in your heart – that there is something else you’d rather be doing. At 25 years old, Andren John Bernardo was caught right in this dilemma, but unlike most Filipinos, the path he’d much rather tread was trickier than usual: the life of a stand-up comedian. Despite the odds and the judgment of his relatives, however, Andren took the plunge, and at 33 will soon be headlining his first live comedy special, Dirty Minutes, on February 22 at Mow’s, Quezon City. In the following Q&A, Andren shares his experience chasing his dream, the anxieties behind creating a solo show, and what the Filipino comedy scene is like now. I was riding on a bus on the way to Baguio for a high school retreat. And somehow someone put a Pork Chop Duo comedy special on the VCD player. They were so dirty and inappropriate, but some of the nuns were laughing. And pretty much everyone started laughing and it fucking ruled. That’s when I started falling in love with stand-up comedy. [I decided to take the stage myself because] I was getting up there in age. I had just turned 25 and thought, if don’t start doing this, it might be too late. Not very well. Most of my family members and relatives are doctors and nurses. My family was too perfect; it needed a black sheep! So I quit nursing and did comedy! My family probably thought it was a phase that I would grow out of. But here I am doing it for close to eight years now. Sorry, family members. My friends also thought I was crazy for doing this. Eight years later, they still think I’m crazy for doing this – but with older voices. My first, first time was at a local gay bar in Pangasinan, and I ate shit. They were nice to me, though. My first time doing an actual open mic in Manila went much better. I took a six-hour bus ride from Pangasinan to Makati and went to this restaurant named Bistro Alphonso (I’d have to go back round-trip since I didn’t have a place in Manila at the time; I’d do this for months at a time before I could commit to moving). Bistro Alphonso was one of the earliest Comedy Manila open mics. It had a karaoke area in the back, and the open mic would happen all while people were smoking and singing. So, I performed stand-up while hearing an admittedly sick rendition of “Careless Whisper” sung by a drunken dude. It sucked. No one laughed and I embarrassed myself, but I loved it! Because I got to do the thing that I was most obsessed about. And the feeling of actually doing it is still ingrained in my brain. Yes! It’s probably healthier to go back to therapy, but it makes me feel less alone when someone laughs at “dark humor.” Like, I fucking got that out of you. There’s no better feeling. I write everyday. It trains my brain to actually focus. Because among other diseases, I also have ADHD. Hahahahah. That writing is very difficult. The worst part of writing is the actual writing. Thinking of the cool shit is the fun part. The technical aspects of writing is a process I had to get used to. That’s why my coworkers at SOLID OK are the best, because we all help each other and we know all of our strengths and weaknesses. We’re like overweight, sad Avengers. It’s super great! With different comedy groups, it has evolved into something where you can actually have a lot of venues to perform with a willing and listening audience. But we as a scene can do better! Like stand-up being sustainable to be able to make it a full-time job, local comedians with Netflix specials, sponsorships, TV spots! Pinoys are the funniest people on earth. We are the meanest and funniest when it comes to making fun of others. We are so self-deprecating and hilarious because misery is in our blood. I will say this though: Sana hindi lang tayo pikon. A lot of comedians said that I could already do an hour. So basically this is my first step in doing that actual hour of material. It’s called Dirty Minutes because it’s the exact amount of cool and silly for a name. Dirty Minutes was conceived through years of testing material at different bars and theaters in the metro. I was always labeled as a “dirty” comedian even though I just did what I found funny. In a way, it’s my reflection of what people saw in me, and a good play on words. Because everyone loves puns. It took me three years to make this special. Writing every day, even during the pandemic. I’m an introvert at heart so I get and write material from the information super highway or the Interweb, as the kids say. Stand-up is forever evolving, so I removed some jokes from this special because I feel like some of my new material trumps some of my old jokes. It’s a super fun process of mixing, matching, and removing jokes. Making the show tighter and more fun in the end – like a jigsaw puzzle, but with jokes about alcoholism and depression. Here were some of the options for the show and the poster that DIDN’T make the cut: 1. Pearless ng Silanganan. Tapos may crown of mics ako sa ulo ko.
2. Don Parusa. It’s me in Mafia regalia with the Parental Advisory sticker sa bibig ko.
3. Happily Ever Laughter. Me in a sleeping beauty pose while being kissed by a clown skeleton. The weeks leading to this show have been anxiety-inducing. I wake up questioning why I keep doing this, hating myself and my disease- and acne-riddled body. But it’s counteracted by me being OBSESSED with stand-up and loving this business and the people in it. These guys rule and they probably get tons of babes because of they’re super funny, fucked up, and sexy. I picked them because I wanted to showcase a different, darker flair in stand-up. Gold is a comedian’s comedian. He is probably the darkest comic working today in the local scene, and people have walked out on his sets, and once someone threatened to sue the guy after being offended to such a great degree. But why I put him in the line-up is the dude’s funny, and he writes like he sold his soul to Satan. He has concise, well-written jokes delivered in this deliberate, almost oil-like manner. He builds the tension up with the most uncomfortable, un-politically correct topics, and the room becomes hyper charged with this terrible energy of “oh fuck.” I haven’t seen anyone do that in the local scene to this degree. It’s like an Anthony Jeselnik who drank a bottle of Robitussin and grew up in Pasig. We are taught to do tight sets, and not let any silence linger, but Gold milks the crowd, playing their emotions like a violin. There are many flavors of laughter, and if someone likes Gold, that means they like comedy and want to see the deeper, more uncomfortable places it can go. Leland’s jokes are as sharp as his jawline. Dude’s funny and charming. He’s been doing this super interesting thing, experimenting with a more story-focused, longer form set wherein he talks about the time Ely Buendia blocked him on Twitter. It gets so many laughs, and you can really tell the audience is engaged. Oftentimes people mistake stand-up comedy for being funny stories told to you, but they really are jokes told in story form. I can’t tell you the number of times a new open micer goes up onstage and tells a gross story they think will land and they just bomb. It’s not that the story isn’t funny, but you have to follow a structure, because comedy is about letting people know when it’s okay to laugh. So a lot of the guys I get are comedians who are tight, and are more writing-oriented, which Leland is, but he also backs it up with the jock “basketball na lang tayo” energy that is infectious. Josel Nicolas is my roommate, and he’s done this longer than I have. He started around two years before me and he was that edgy idiot doing dumb shit onstage, making me go, “Who is this for?” He’s been doing it on and off, and has only been consistent this past year. It’s a medium borne out of failure, and Josel’s failed a lot. And that’s not a slight on him; I like comedians who go all out. I know he came from the local comics scene, but he really fought against doing any drawing onstage, but now he’s doing this Dmitri Martin schtick, but if Dmitri Martin did a lot of anti-Marcos and Duterte art for the Left and was embittered for the past 16 years doing comics that no one wanted. He introduced me to weird hole-in-the-wall bars, where I did sets for anyone, and really honed my craft. ‘Cause we wanna do this in front of everyone, while understanding that not everyone is gonna like us. Host Micah Andres is a temperamental, rich conyo kid (it’s our angsty Jewish comedian equivalent in the Philippines), but ironically what he excels at is being THE best guy at crowd work. He is cantankerous and pretentious onstage and still manages to charm the crowd’s pants off. He is funny as fuck; I have seen this dude kill with no material at all and works up the audience into frenzies for Mows Open Siomaic, which he’s developed and run for the past six years. I honestly don’t like giving advice to starting comedians. If you feel that you want to do this, then just do it. It doesn’t matter what I or anyone else says. If it’s your calling then write and start looking for open mics online! – Rappler.com Andren Bernardo’s Dirty Minutes comedy special is on February 22 at Mow’s, Diliman, Quezon City."
https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-says-politics-after-exile-for-own-survival/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – For President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., joining politics was a way to defend and ensure the survival of his infamous clan. In a lengthy conversation with World Economic Forum (WEF) President Børge Brende in Davos, Switzerland, Marcos spoke candidly about what drove him to enter politics. “After we came back from the US, after exile, when we were first allowed to come back, the political issue was ‘Marcos,’” he said, referring to their homecoming in 1991. It was on July 31, 1991 when then-president Cory Aquino – who replaced Marcos’ father and namesake following the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution – allowed the clan to step foot in the Philippines, in hopes to put former first lady Imelda Marcos on trial for crimes committed during their decades-long “conjugal dictatorship.” “We were in exile for six years so we weren’t sure if we were coming back at all; physically coming back. My father never made it back. He died in Hawaii. So that was a very trying time – those were dark days for the family and I dare say even for the country,” he said. So for the family at them, said Marcos, entering politics was about going on the defensive. “For us, to defend ourselves politically, someone had to enter politics and be in the political arena so that at least… not only the legacy of my father, but even our own survival required that somebody go into politics,” he explained. A little over a year after their return to the Philippines, Marcos ran and won as congressman of their home province of Ilocos Norte. When his father was president, Marcos served as vice governor and later governor of Ilocos Norte. Much more has changed since their return from exile. Through the decades, the President’s paternal and maternal clans expanded their political power. Two of his close relatives hold top elected posts – sister Imee is a senator while cousin Martin Romualdez is House speaker. His son, newbie congressman Ferdinand Alexander, represents the 1st District of Ilocos Norte and deemed as a “senior” House leader. The Marcoses and their relatives or close allies continue to dominate Ilocos Norte politics. In May 2022, Marcos won as the first majority-elected president since the post-People Power era, in an election remembered for the spread of disinformation online. “If you were to ask me when I was 23, 24, 25 years old, ‘Will you enter the politics?’ Before you finish asking the question, I’ve already said no, no, no, no. But you know, life takes you to certain…places that you did not expect. And so once I was entrenched in the political arena, I said, well – if we’re going to do this, you better do it well,” Marcos told Brende. (Based on his official resumé, Marcos first served as Ilocos Norte governor in 1981, at the age of 23. He became a member of his father’s political party, Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, in 1980.) In 2022, Marcos ran on a platform of “unity” without presenting any concrete vision. His 2022 coalition was formidable from the onset: he ran alongside Sara Duterte, the daughter of the popular and controversial outgoing president then, Rodrigo Duterte. While his was a campaign promise of continuity, Marcos sought to take a calmer, less bombastic approach than his predecessor. He’s taken a much friendlier stance towards long-time ally the United States, while speaking of a “golden age” in the Philippines’ relations with China. Marcos is in Davos, Switzerland, until January 20 to attend the WEF. This is his 8th trip outside the Philippines to date, and his third in 2023 alone. He is headed to Japan in February, for his next state visit. – Rappler.com"

The reclusive country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, held a two-day meeting from Tuesday, January 17, to discuss government budget, economic policy, and personnel changes, the official KCNA news agency said. South Korea’s central bank has said the North’s economy shrank in 2021 for a second straight year after suffering its biggest contraction in more than two decades the year before, hit by COVID-19 lockdowns and international sanctions over its weapons programs. Leader Kim Jong-un did not join the meeting, but Kim Tok-hun, premier of the Cabinet, reviewed last year’s work and laid out tasks this year for key industries. The premier lauded the country for “successfully tackling the worst-ever upheaval since the founding of the country” amid the COVID-19 outbreak, despite “shortcomings” in implementing last year’s plans. The Cabinet aims to expedite the production of overall sectors and make 2023 “a year of great turn and change in the course of development” marking the 75th anniversary of the country’s foundation, Kim said. “It will make sure that the economic indices and 12 major goals to be attained by all the sectors of the national economy are carried out without fail,” Kim said, according to KCNA. He called for normalizing the production of metal factories and reinforcing iron mines and steel plants, and for operating chemical plants “at full capacity” to accelerate construction projects. The country will also take “strong measures” to supply equipment, materials, and funds to boost coal production, Kim said. In another KCNA dispatch on budget deliberations, Finance Minister Ko Jong-bom said this year’s overall spending is expected to rise by 101.7% from last year, without specifying numbers. Some 45% of the total expenditure will be allotted to promote the economy and the people’s livelihoods, while defense spending would take up 15.9%, about the same as last year, Ko said. “The state budget for this year should be implemented without fail to financially support the work for bolstering up the country’s defense capability, developing the economy, and improving the people’s standard of living,” Ko told the parliament. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-legacy/,[],"Jacinda Ardern has put tiny New Zealand on the map in her five years as prime minister, becoming a global icon for left-leaning politics and women in leadership, even as she struggled at home with the economy and COVID-19 restrictions. The 41-year-old – who gained attention for bringing her baby to a United Nations meeting and wearing a hijab after a massacre targeting Muslims – announced in similarly dramatic fashion on Thursday, January 19, that she will step down in less than three weeks, saying she had “no more in the tank.” “Be strong, be kind,” New Zealand’s youngest prime minister in more than a century repeated through her eventful tenure, but her empathetic leadership and crisis management skills often masked her government’s shortcomings. Considered personable and engaging, Ardern turned speaking from the heart and smiling through adversity into a winning formula for surging to power in 2017 and returning with a blowout win in 2020 that ushered in New Zealand’s first purely left-leaning government in decades. Her leadership was marked by unprecedented events for the island nation of 5 million: the 2019 massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch by a white supremacist and the eruption of the White Island volcano, and, the next year, the pandemic. “I hope I leave New Zealanders with a belief that you can be kind but strong, empathetic but decisive, optimistic but focussed,” Ardern said in an emotional resignation announcement. “And that you can be your own kind of leader – one who knows when it’s time to go.” Ardern received worldwide praise for her response to the Christchurch attacks, which she labeled terrorism. Wearing a headscarf, she met the Muslim community, telling them New Zealand was “united in grief.” She delivered a ban on semiautomatic firearms and other gun curbs within weeks of the massacre, a stark contrast to the United States, where lawmakers and activists have struggled to address gun violence despite regular mass shootings. Launching a global campaign to end online hate, she has often herself been a target of right-wing extremists online. Ardern made global headlines in 2020, presiding over New Zealand’s most diverse parliament, with more than half the members women and the highest number of indigenous Maori lawmakers. When COVID arrived, she was among the first leaders to close borders and pursue a zero-tolerance strategy that kept New Zealanders safe from the virus, holding death rates far below those of other advanced nations. But not everyone was happy with her “go hard, go early” approach, which included a nationwide lockdown over a single infection. While Ardern’s popularity rose internationally, at home she has faced growing political headwinds, struggling to prove that her leadership extended beyond crisis management and kindness. Her ratings have dropped in recent months on a worsening housing crisis, rising living costs and mortgage rates, and growing concerns about crime. She remains, however, more popular that her rivals. Despite her promises of transformational leadership, Ardern’s affordable housing programs have been set back by blunders. Even on climate change, which Ardern called “my generation’s nuclear-free moment,” progress has been incremental. Ardern burst onto the global scene in 2017 when she became the world’s youngest female head of government at the age of 37. Riding a wave of “Jacinda-mania,” she campaigned passionately for women’s rights and an end to child poverty and economic inequality in the country. Raised a Mormon by her mother and police officer father, Ardern left the church over its stance on LGBTQ people in the early 2000s and has since described herself as agnostic. Hours after being appointed Labour Party leader, she was asked whether she planned to have children. Ardern said it was “totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace.” Eight months after becoming premier, she had a baby daughter, becoming only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto. Less than three months later, Ardern brought the baby, Neve Te Aroha, to the UN General Assembly in New York. Many took her pregnancy and prime minister’s maternity leave as symbolizing progress for women leaders, part of a wave of progressive female leaders including Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin. Meeting with Marin in Wellington in November, Ardern shot back at a question whether the two were meeting only because of they were young and female. “I wonder whether or not anyone ever asked Barack Obama and John Key if they met because they were of similar age,” Ardern said, in reference to the former US president and New Zealand prime minister. “Because two women meet, it’s not simply because of their gender.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/south-korean-government-proposes-flexible-overtime-rules-some-fear-workers-may-suffer/,[],"SEOUL, South Korea – The administration of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol wants to allow people to work up to 69 hours a week – up from the current 52 – and bank overtime hours in exchange for time off, a plan it hopes will promote family growth alongside productivity. The government says the plan, set to be announced next month, will provide more flexibility in the labor market. Officials say people would work less as a whole, encouraging them to have families and shore up a fertility rate that is projected to hit a global-low 0.7 in 2024. It would supersede a 2018 law that limited the work week to 52 hours – 40 hours of regular work plus 12 hours of overtime. The Ministry of Employment and Labor said in a statement that law had fallen behind the times. “If you are working at ice cream factories for example, you can work overtime seasonally, then save the hours of work and use later to go on a longer holiday,” the ministry said of the reform. The proposal would allow employers and workers to agree on whether to count overtime by the week, with 12 hours allowed; the month, with 52 hours allowed; the quarter, with 140 hours allowed; a half year, with 250 hours; or a full year, with 440 hours of overtime allowed. For counting periods of a month or longer, up to 29 hours a week of overtime would be allowed, for a total of 69 work hours in one week. Overtime could be exchanged later for time off at a rate that has not been announced. Only 14% of South Koreans were in trade unions in 2021, data show, which could limit how much workers can negotiate. In a statement, the Korean Women’s Associations United said “only regulations like the 52-hour workweek and pressure from labor unions can protect workers from long working hours.” The law must be passed by the National Assembly, where Yoon’s political opponents hold the majority. Opposition politicians have said they oppose the plan, with Representative Park Yong-jin of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea calling it a “shortcut to population extinction.” The labor ministry has brushed off such criticisms, saying the proposal would “only add more choice.” More than 18% of South Koreans worked more than 50 hours a week in the world’s 10th largest economy in 2021, according to unpublished data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – the fifth highest after Turkey, Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica. The move has been welcomed by the country’s major business lobbying groups, including the Korea Enterprise Federation, which described it as “necessary.” But some experts are skeptical that the new proposal would reduce how much people work. “The beauty of introducing a 52-hour workweek was that you gave a signal to employers, unions, and workers saying, ‘Listen, you really have to do something about the long working hours culture in your country,’” said Willem Adema, a senior economist at the social policy division of the OECD. “If the current legislation is all about giving flexibility then that’s fine. But it doesn’t seem to be interpreted as such.” The government says allowing workers to spend accrued overtime hours on vacations will mean people who want to work less – such as parents or caregivers – will be able to do so. Extending working hours, even temporarily, affects women more than men, said Lee Min-ah, professor of sociology at Chung-Ang University. “When male partners work more, women’s economic activity will be discouraged and their responsibility of childcare will only increase,” Lee said. The country already has the lowest fertility rate in the world, and a rapidly aging population. The working-age population peaked at 38 million in 2019 and is set to drop by more than 9 million by 2040, government data show. Lee Yoon-sun, a 29-year-old office worker, said working high-intensity hours and then taking time off would be disruptive. “Working long hours when you have a heavy workload and then resting when you are less busy seems like a pattern that will lead to an irregular life, affecting having children and taking care of them,” said Lee, who does not have children.

In separate interviews with Rappler, PWDs from Maguindanao del Norte and the special geographic area in Pikit, Cotabato, expressed their desire to participate in planning, legislation, and policy-making in the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA). “We want representation in crafting laws that will directly affect us, including budget allocation,” said Kenneth Angas Pasaol, PWD group president in Pikit. “We may not have enough technical know-how in policy and crafting laws, but we are more than willing to learn and let our voices be heard.” PWDs have also highlighted the need for proper infrastructure, such as the construction of railings and pathways in government offices and public places, to accommodate their needs. They also want to be included in public consultation processes, particularly in remote areas, and for their voices to be heard in the region’s policy-making body. “We need laws to promote our interests in the BARMM,” said Norhanie Mamasabulod-Taha, PWD Association officer in Pagalungan, Maguindanao del Sur. “Every PWD deserves equal opportunities as those who have no weaknesses.” Their call came after European Union Ambassador Luc Veron emphasized the importance of including marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as PWDs and the elderly, in public consultations organized in line with efforts of the region’s interim officials to finalize draft electoral and local government codes. “We hope that more people will be reached, especially those in the remote areas of the region, more voices heard from widely disseminated information and public service efficiently delivered,” Veron said at a BARMM event in Cotabato City on Monday, January 16. Organized PWDs in the Muslim majority-region are getting support from organizations such as the Mindanao Organization for Social and Economic Progress (MOSEP) and the Asia Foundation in promoting their interests and elevating their agenda to the plenary of the BTA. A proposed Bangsamoro PWD code is currently being deliberated upon and is expected to become law soon. – Rappler.com"

Trump launched his bid to regain the presidency in 2024 in November. Meta, the world’s biggest social media company, is set to make a controversial decision on the future of Trump’s accounts this month. While Trump has shunned Twitter since its decision in November to restore his account, saying he preferred his own Truth Social platform, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, January 18, that being back on Facebook “will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.” Meta revoked Trump’s access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, including a video containing false claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. The company’s independent oversight board ruled later in 2021 that the suspension was justified but objected to its indeterminate nature. In response, Meta committed to reviewing the suspension two years after it began. “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded,” Meta VP of global affairs Nick Clegg wrote at the time. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/lake-sebu-south-cotabato-state-calamity-fish-kills/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – The local government of Lake Sebu in South Cotabato has declared a state of calamity in the town due to fish kills which have affected the local tilapia raising industry. Lake Sebu Vice Mayor Remie Unggol on Tuesday, January 17, announced plans to implement a moratorium on the operation of fish cages in the lake for six months to one year in order to allow the lake to heal. The tilapia industry in the town has already lost more than P10 million, affecting around 30% of the fish pens in Lake Sebu. Experts have attributed the fish kills to the excessive number of fish cages, which has led to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the lake and the settling of waste and debris at the bottom of the lake. The lake is the main source of income for many residents, especially the indigenous T’boli people who inhabit the area, officials said. Unggol said many residents dependent on the lake would need to swallow a bitter pill. “With its condition now, the lake cannot be rehabilitated without a moratorium, a sacrifice that our constituents must bear,” said Unggol, himself a T’boli. The fish kills, called “kamahong” by the T’boli, has so far adversely affected around 150 fish pen operators with over 1,340 fish cages, according to the town’s deputy lake warden Jose Rudy Muyco. The affected fish cages account for about 1,530 loads of fingerlings worth more than P2 million. The cause of kamahong is attributed to the depletion of dissolved oxygen, which usually happens when the tilapia are nearing harvest and require more oxygen intake. The recent bad weather in the area also contributed to the problem by depriving the lake of needed sunlight, according to Muyco. Lake Sebu is the biggest of the three lakes in the town, and it has more than 5,000 fish cages mostly for tilapia, occupying about a third of the lake’s area. Despite attempts in the past to limit the number of fish cages in the lake, the number has notably increased over the years. Experts from various agencies and universities conducting studies in the lake have noted that a major factor in the deterioration of the lake’s ecosystem is the overcrowding of fish cages, which triggers more waste and debris from excess fish-feeds to settle at the lake’s bottom. Some fish cage operators have been remiss in their obligations to employ best aquaculture practices which they committed in an agreement with the local government, according to Muyco. He said many fish pen operators were not following the required spacing of fish pens, and failed to undertake regular clean-up measures, like removal of water hyacinths from their cages. The Fisheries Code states that the utilization of the lake for aquaculture must not exceed 10% of its total area. But the present number of fish cages in Lake Sebu now exceeds a dozen times what the lake’s ecosystem can accommodate, experts pointed out. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/davos-2023-neal-stephenson-snowcrash-author-metaverse-vision-meta/,[],"DAVOS, Switzerland – The author who first envisioned the metaverse 30 years ago sat down on Wednesday, January 18, with a top executive from the company investing billions in building it and agreed there were formidable hurdles to bringing it to the masses. Neal Stephenson, who coined the term in his 1992 novel Snowcrash, and Chris Cox, the chief product officer at Meta, laid out an array of engineering breakthroughs needed to allow millions of people to move seamlessly through immersive virtual worlds displayed on head-mounted devices. “We’re in the very early version, the Xerox PARC era,” said Cox at a World Economic Forum panel, referring to the company that developed the mouse and other fundamental computer technologies 50 years ago. “We’ve got a ways to go,” said Stephenson, who as well as writing science fiction has worked for technology companies including rocket maker Blue Origin. “It’s really just in the last couple of years that everything has come together.” Cox, whose company is spending billions of dollars developing software and hardware for the metaverse, said one of the biggest problems is the trade-off between speed and graphics quality. Virtual environments such as a comedy club, for example, need to support large numbers of user avatars to engagingly simulate the real-world atmospherics of chatter and laughter. But updating those avatars in synchronicity with the movements of their operators limits the processing power available for high-quality graphics. “We’re trying to figure out if comedy can work,” he said. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said he expected his metaverse investments to take around a decade to pay off. By that time, Cox says people will be able to take a walk with friends and family in virtual worlds as readily as they now make video or voice calls. Meta racked up losses of $9.44 billion at its Reality Labs metaverse unit from January to September last year and is expected to see that number grow significantly in 2023. That has hammered its shares and contributed to its decision to cut 11,000 jobs. The ability to move fluidly between experiences in different virtual worlds while retaining clothes and other items associated with an avatar is an issue Stephenson is trying to address through a company he has founded to develop blockchain applications. He said a key question was whether the metaverse was going to be a decentralized technology built from the bottom up or one created top-down by a single company. “A more open metaverse is better,” HP chief executive Enrique Lores said on the panel. “If someone controls the full metaverse the ability for others to add value is much smaller.” – Rappler.com"

Chee Kee was then asked by his doctor to take a break. The Parokya ni Edgar vocalist shared that he initially asked his bandmates to not play while Chee Kee was recovering, but the guitarist urged them to continue performing. “We owe it to Gab, and more importantly, to everyone na patuloy na sumusuporta sa (who continues to support) Parokya, to continue playing.” Miranda revealed that due to the complications of Chee Kee’s lymphoma, the guitarist was battling pneumonia and had been transferred to the ICU, where he had been intubated for more than a week. He continued that while Chee Kee was “financially prepared” for the chemotherapy, the guitarist’s family needed help with the “overwhelming” hospital bills. Miranda said that his bandmate was initially hesitant to seek assistance but was convinced by his family, friends, and other musicians to not “deny the people who cared for him, the opportunity to help him out.” “Parokya and our friends from music scene will be doing a series of fundraising gigs to help Gab out.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/things-to-know-eduardo-ano/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ next national security adviser (NSA) is a veteran combatant with deep experience in the intelligence field. He has spent years managing a civilian bureaucracy and responding to crisis at the frontlines of the country’s battle against COVID-19. From the Aquino administration to the Duterte government, and now, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s presidency, retired general and former interior secretary Eduardo Año is back in government – this time as one of its chief security officials. Año, 61, assumed the role after Marcos’ first NSA, Clarita Carlos, found the position to be “political.” Explaining his decision to appoint Año, Marcos cited the retired military officer’s “long, long, long experience in intelligence.” Marcos also said, “He’s well-known and he knows all of the operatives in the intelligence community.” Año’s incoming stint is the latest in a decades-long career that has taken him from the battlefield to the halls of Malacañang. In the military, Año excelled the most in intelligence work, serving as chief of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and commander of the Army’s Intelligence Security Group (ISG). Known to many as a “rebel hunter,” Año scored high-profile arrests of communist leaders, including Benito Tiamzon, the once elusive leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Tiamzon, who was captured in 2014, had been released from detention in 2016 to be part of past peace talks held between the Duterte government and communists. Tiamzon and his wife, Wilma, later went back underground in 2017 after peace talks ended in September 2022. Tiamzon’s sister sought help from the Commission on Human Rights to verify if the couple was among rebels killed in an encounter with the military in Samar. As commander of the 10th Infantry Division based in Davao, Año was also credited for the neutralization of New People’s Army commander Leonardo Pitao alias Kumander Parago, who was killed in a military encounter in June 2015. The military earlier cited these incidents as being among those that significantly weakened the communist movement. Aside from these, it was also Año who led the hunt for retired Major General Jovito Palparan, who was convicted by a local court in 2018 for kidnapping and serious illegal detention charges. Palparan was linked to the 2006 disappearance of University of the Philippines students Karen Empeño and Sherlyn Cadapan. As he rose through the military hierarchy, controversy did not elude Año. While he was in the ISG, the retired general was allegedly involved in the disappearance of activist Jonas Burgos, son of the late press freedom icon Jose Burgos. For this, Año’s promotions were repeatedly blocked by Edita Burgos, Jonas’ mother, who continues to search for her missing son years later. Año has denied any involvement in Burgos’ disappearance and was later cleared by local courts. As part of his training, Año took up the International Officer Intelligence Course at the US military training school, Fort Huachuca, in Arizona in 1993. He scored a perfect 100% rating. He is also a graduate of the elite Scout Ranger Course. Año’s military career culminated with his stint as AFP chief from December 2016 to October 2017. During this time, he led the military as troops fought against local terrorists in the 2017 Marawi siege. The five-month battle was the Philippine military’s longest and bloodiest operation since World War II. Prior to this, Año served as commanding general of the Philippine Army under the late former president Benigno Aquino III from July 2015 to December 2016. Before that, he was brigade commander of the 201st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. Año is part of the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1983. After retiring from the military in October 2017, Año was appointed by Duterte as secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). He held the title in acting capacity until November 2018, after a one-year ban against the appointment of retired military officers to civilian posts had lapsed. At the helm of the DILG, Año was tasked with overseeing the Philippines’ local government-led response to COVID-19 as well as its implementation of community quarantine measures that aimed to curb the spread of the virus. Año was also in charge of commanding Duterte’s controversial war on drugs. At the time, Año said he wanted to ensure the Philippine National Police waged a campaign that “uses and follows the rule of law.” The bloody operation saw at least 7,000 killed at the hands of police. Human rights groups, however, reported the count was much higher with at least 30,000 people dead as of 2019 due to the campaign. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/nationwide-strike-france-macron-pension-reform/,[],"PARIS, France – Trains will grind to a halt in France on Thursday, January 19, classrooms will be shut and businesses disrupted as workers walk off their jobs in an attempt to derail a planned pension reform that would see the retirement age pushed up by two years to 64. The nationwide day of strikes and protests is not only a major test for President Emmanuel Macron, but also for the unions. Opinion polls show French voters overwhelmingly reject a reform that the government says is vital to ensure the pension system does not go bust. The challenge for unions, which are far less powerful in France than they used to be, is whether they can transform that opposition to the reform – and anger with a cost-of-living crisis – into a mass social protest that would last beyond Thursday and eventually get the government to back-track. “Inflation, working conditions, pensions…(people) are fed up with all this and that’s why we think many will join us,” said Simone Legendre, a member of the CFE-CGC union that represents white-collar workers. For Macron, what is at stake is his reformist credentials, both at home and with his European Union peers, as well as keeping public spending in check. Pushing back the retirement age by two years and extending the pay-in period would yield an additional 17.7 billion euros ($19.1 billion) in annual pension contributions, allowing the system to break even by 2027, according to Labor Ministry estimates. Unions argue there are other ways to ensure the viability of the pension system. Government spokesman Oliver Veran said the cabinet was “calm, determined” ahead of the strike and urged workers not to paralyse the country. Unions have described the day as a starting point, with more strikes and protests to follow. “What nobody can know, and even the unions don’t know is whether French people are cross enough to…block the country,” said Sciences Po professor Bruno Palier. The reform still needs to go through parliament, where Macron has lost his absolute majority but is hoping to get it adopted with the support of conservatives. Public transport will be severely disrupted on Thursday. Only between one-in-three and one-in-five high-speed TGV lines will be operating, with barely any local or regional trains running, the SNCF rail operator said. Some seven-out-of-10 primary school teachers have said they will strike, their main union said, while no refined oil products will be shipped from the TotalEnergies’ refinery in Dunkirk as refinery workers join the action. “There’s nothing good in this reform,” said Rozenn Cros, in the southern French city of Cannes, as she and other teachers prepared for the strike, with banners including “No to 64.” France’s hardline CGT union has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to lawmakers and billionaires, while the government said 10,000 police would be on the streets to try and make sure the protests do not turn violent. Meanwhile, Macron and several of his ministers will be in Barcelona on Thursday for a meeting with the Spanish government. – Rappler.com $1 = 0.9246 euros"
https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-janet-yellen-china-liu-he-meeting-switzerland-january-2023/,[],"ZURICH, Switzerland – US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen agreed with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to enhance communication about macroeconomic and financial issues during a “candid, substantive, and constructive” meeting in Zurich on Wednesday, January 18, the Treasury said. In a statement, the Treasury said both sides agreed to enhance cooperation on climate finance on a bilateral and multilateral basis, such as within the United Nations, Group of 20 economies, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. “While we have areas of disagreement, and we will convey them directly, we should not allow misunderstandings, particularly those stemming from a lack of communication, to unnecessarily worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship,” Yellen said at the start of the meeting. Liu said both countries need “serious communication” and coordination on issues including climate change and the economy, and that he was ready for an in-depth exchange. “We do believe that we have to always bear in mind the bigger picture, try to manage our differences appropriately and seek common ground,” Liu said, speaking through an interpreter. “In this way, hopefully we can work together to maintain the overall stability of Chinese-US relations.” US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to increase communication when they met in Indonesia in November. “Both sides agreed it is important for the functioning of the global economy to further enhance communication around macroeconomic and financial issues,” the Treasury said after Yellen and Liu met. “Secretary Yellen also raised issues of concern in a frank exchange of views,” it added. “She looks forward to traveling to China and to welcoming her counterparts to the United States in the near future.” A senior Treasury official said that, during the meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, Yellen and Liu agreed that both countries could take steps to avert recessions in their own economies, and the two delegations had a productive discussion about sovereign debt issues, food security, and energy. On economic prospects, Chinese officials were aware of financial risks posed by the property sector but were optimistic about resuming closer to normal growth, the official said of the meeting, the first in person since Yellen became secretary. The China side expressed concern over US economic, trade, and technological policies towards China and its hope that the US will pay attention to how such policies were affecting both countries, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. “China welcomes Yellen to visit China at an appropriate time this year. Both countries agreed that their economic and trade teams will continue to maintain communications and exchanges at all levels,” it said. Washington in October imposed export controls on China to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances, including measures to curb China’s access to US chipmaking tools and cut it off from certain chips made anywhere in the world with American equipment. Liu, a confidant of Xi, on Tuesday, January 17, urged global leaders gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum to abandon what he called a “Cold War mentality” and expand international cooperation on issues such as climate change. Yellen and other top US officials say the US economy should be able to skip a recession in 2023, but acknowledge slower growth is likely. China’s economic growth looks set to rebound from mid-2023 following relaxed COVID-19 curbs after slumping to one of its worst levels in nearly half a century. The International Monetary Fund has warned against decoupling the global economy into two competing blocs, saying it could reduce global economic output by up to 7%, and even more in vulnerable countries. Yellen’s meeting with Liu came before a three-country visit to Africa, where she will push to expand US trade and business ties with the continent, which China has long dominated. She is also expected to repeat her criticism of Beijing – now the world’s largest creditor – for not moving more quickly to provide debt relief, as well as its use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region and “non-market” economic practices. Yellen has met virtually three times with Liu since taking office, and met in Bali, Indonesia, with Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang. Liu will step down this year as part of an overhaul of China’s economic leadership disclosed in September. In December, Yellen told reporters she was also open to visiting China and looked forward to more “intense interactions” with Chinese officials. – Rappler.com"

The ministry said it had spent 2.41 trillion roubles ($35.1 billion) from the NWF, a rainy day fund that accumulates oil revenues, to cover the deficit in December. Along with heavy state borrowing at domestic debt auctions, the NWF – which was originally intended to support the pension system – has become the main source of financing for the budget deficit since Russia invaded Ukraine last year and was hit by waves of unprecedented Western sanctions. The government also drew on it last year to prop up struggling state companies including Russian Railways and the airline Aeroflot. Analysts have said Russia’s attempts to plug its budget deficit by selling foreign currency reserves could lead to a vicious circle that pushes the rouble higher and further reduces the Kremlin’s crucial export revenues from oil and gas. The size of the NWF at January 1 was equivalent to 7.8% of gross domestic product, the finance ministry said. But only $87.2 billion, or 4.6% of GDP, was in liquid assets. At February 1 last year, three weeks before the invasion, the total fund stood at $174.9 billion, or 10.2% of projected GDP. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last week that Russia recorded a budget deficit of 2.3% of GDP last year, having targeted a surplus of 1% before the start of the war. According to the budget law, the finance ministry can spend another 4.2 trillion roubles, currently worth around $61 billion, over the next two years to plug the deficit. As a result, according to the ministry, NWF liquid funds in accounts with the central bank could fall to 2.3 trillion roubles or 1.4% of GDP by the end of 2024, which the Accounts Chamber said would be the lowest ratio for 20 years. In a further indication of pressure on the budget, finance ministry data showed that tax revenues from imports, which are subject to duties and value-added tax, fell by 20% or almost 1 trillion roubles in 2022. Imports plummeted last year as a result of Western sanctions and an exodus of Western firms from Russia, though they began to recover in the second half of the year. – Rappler.com $1 = 68.6950 roubles"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/united-states-arrests-bitzlato-cofounder-alleges-process-illicit-funds/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – US authorities said on Wednesday, January 18, they have arrested the majority shareholder and cofounder of Hong Kong-registered virtual currency exchange Bitzlato Ltd for allegedly processing $700 million in illicit funds. Anatoly Legkodymov, a Russian national living in China, was arrested in Miami on Tuesday on charges that he operated the exchange as an unlicensed money exchange business that “in his own words, catered to ‘known crooks,'” a top Justice Department official said. Prosecutors said Bitzlato exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency with Hydra Market, which they described as an illicit online marketplace for narcotics, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering services that US and German law enforcement shut down in April 2022. “Whether you break our laws from China or Europe or abuse our financial system from a tropical island – you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told reporters at a news conference at the Justice Department. Bitzlato also received more than $15 million in ransomware proceeds, prosecutors said. It was not immediately possible to contact Hydra Market for comment. “Despite it being a small name, it carries a lot of weight,” said Chen Arad, the chief operating officer at Solidus Labs, a crypto market surveillance company. “Small actors are not safe and they carry just as much risk as any big-name exchange (or) platform,” he said. Authorities described Legkodymov as the cryptocurrency exchange’s cofounder, saying the 40-year-old Russian helped run the company from the Chinese city of Shenzhen. Legkodymov did not immediately respond to an email with questions, and messages left on Bitzlato’s automated Telegram support chat service were answered with the phrase, “Oops, sorry.” Bitzlato has processed $4.58 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions since May 3, 2018, prosecutors said, adding a substantial portion constitutes “the proceeds of crime.” It also broke rules requiring significant vetting of customers and failed to meet requirements aimed at preventing money laundering, authorities said. Archived versions of Bitzlato’s website noted that the site’s clients could register using “only your email.” Prosecutors said Bitzlato knowingly serviced US customers and conducted transactions with US-based exchanges using US online infrastructure. For at least some period of time, it was being managed by the defendant while he was in the United States, they said. The charges were filed in conjunction with the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which said it has prohibited certain transmittals of funds involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution after labeling Bitzlato Ltd a “primary money laundering concern” related to Russian illicit finance. “Identifying Bitzlato as a primary money laundering concern effectively renders the exchange an international pariah,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said at the news conference. Adeyemo said Bitzlato has repeatedly facilitated transactions for Russian-affiliated ransomware groups, including the gang behind Conti, which he said has links to the Russian government and Russia-connected darknet markets. Cari Stinebower, a former Treasury Department official now a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, said the penalties imposed are akin to those under Section 311 of the US Patriot Act and will make Bitzlato untouchable by US and foreign banks. “None of the mainstream financial institutions will deal with an entity identified as a primary money laundering concern,” she said. “While US financial institutions will refuse to engage in business with Bitzlato, (one would expect that) other financial institutions will follow suit,” she added. “The impact will be to freeze Bitzlato out of the global financial sector almost immediately.” By midday Wednesday, Bitzlato’s website was replaced by a notice saying that the service had been seized by French authorities “as part of a coordinated international law enforcement action.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/ukrainian-interior-minister-monastyrskyi-killed-helicopter-crash-zelenskiy-orders-probe/,[],"BROVARY, Ukraine – A helicopter crashed in fog near a nursery outside Kyiv on Wednesday, January 18, killing 14 people, including Ukraine‘s interior minister, in what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called a “terrible tragedy,” before calling for an investigation. The crash set off a large fire, and an entire side of the local nursery building was charred. The Kyiv region’s governor said children and staff had been in the nursery at the time of the crash shortly after 8 am (0600 GMT). Several bodies lay on the ground of a courtyard, their boots sticking out from under blankets, after the helicopter – described by the air force spokesperson as a French Super Puma – slammed into a building in Brovary, northeast of the capital. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said he had asked the country’s SBU intelligence service to launch a criminal investigation. Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi died along with his first deputy, Yevheniy Yenin, and the ministry’s state secretary. Monastyrskyi was 42 and had been interior minister since July 2021. Ukrainian officials have not suggested the crash was an attack by Russian forces waging war in Ukraine. Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said it could take several weeks to investigate the disaster. “Today, a terrible tragedy occurred in Brovary, Kyiv region,” Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. “The pain is unspeakable.” The SBU said it was considering several possible causes, including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction, and the intentional destruction of the helicopter. “We saw wounded people, we saw children. There was a lot of fog here, everything was strewn all around. We could hear screams, we ran towards them,” said Hlib, a 17-year-old resident. “We took the children and passed them over the fence, away from the nursery as it was on fire, especially the second floor,” he said near the nursery, where people left flowers and soft toys at a small makeshift memorial. A subdued Zelenskiy expressed gratitude to passersby and nursery employees for safeguarding the children during nearly nine hours of rescue efforts. “This has been a dreadful day which we must get through and must endure. And we will endure it,” he said in his address, singling out childcare workers by name. “To Miss Ruslana, Miss Olena, Miss Tamara, Miss Kateryna, all those working in the nursery, thank you!” he said. The crash was another blow to Ukraine, days after 45 people were killed in an apartment block hit during a missile attack on the east-central city of Dnipro. POLICE CHIEF APPOINTED The government quickly named national police chief Ihor Klymenko as acting interior minister. The State Emergency Service put the death toll at 14, including the three helicopter crew and six others on board. One child was killed on the ground and 11 other children were among 25 injured people, it said. Vitaliy, a 56-year-old resident, said he saw the helicopter fall quickly and crash onto the grounds of the nursery in the centre of a residential courtyard. The helicopter wreckage later lay crumpled by an apartment block, rotor blades resting against the entrance. Above the charred entrance to the two-storey nursery building was a gaping hole several feet wide. “There was no explosion. I thought it was the engine from a rocket or something like that, something very large, about 10 metres tall,” Vitaliy said. Two other witnesses described seeing an object hurtling towards the nursery from a northwesterly direction.

https://www.rappler.com/business/germany-olaf-scholz-upbeat-energy-warning-deglobalization-world-economic-forum-davos-2023/,[],"BERLIN, Germany – Germany’s energy supply for this winter is secure, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday, January 18, adding that the ability of Europe’s largest economy to swiftly wean itself off Russian gas has shown how flexible and speedy it can be. In an upbeat speech at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Scholz highlighted efforts to get over the energy crisis unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the swift creation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. These terminals will help replace Russian pipeline gas that used to account for half of Germany’s gas imports. Critics say that Germany might not have faced a major energy crisis if it had taken such measures to diversify supply before the war. “It shows: Germany can be flexible; we can be unbureaucratic; and we can be fast,” Scholz said. The chancellor highlighted how the crisis had sped up the transformation towards a green economy – the LNG terminals could, for example, eventually be used for hydrogen. Scholz said he was aware additional gas resources needed to be found to ensure greater European demand for LNG did not drive up prices and therefore scarcity for poorer countries, without elaborating on how to go about that or whether Germany would be willing to invest in new gas projects. “Of course, we must avoid new lock-ins, new path dependencies at all costs,” he said, adding this could be done by making new project hydrogen-ready “from the very outset and by expanding renewables in parallel.” Germany was competitive before the Ukraine war when energy prices were already comparably high because its business model was mainly based on “highly specialized research-and-technology-intensive industrial products,” not energy-intensive mass production, he said. As such, it remained competitive. Scholz warned however against the danger of deglobalization that hung like “a sword of Damocles” over the world. New geopolitical tensions have led to disruptions in trade that are particularly difficult for an export-driven economy like Germany’s. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/latin-america/first-migrants-cross-united-states-from-mexico-mobile-app/,[],"MEXICO – Migrants on Mexico’s northern border on Wednesday, January 18, began entering the United States using a mobile app designed to facilitate the process of applying for asylum, although several quickly reported difficulties in using the system. This month, the Biden administration said it would broaden use of the so-called CBP One app to allow asylum seekers to enter their personal information as a pre-screening step for a US appointment to request asylum. “I’m really excited, I can’t wait to see my family,” said Alejandra, a Venezuelan migrant who entered El Paso, Texas from the border city of Ciudad Juarez, headed for Florida. Giovanny Castellanos, another Venezuelan who has been waiting on the Mexican border for months to enter the United States, said he got an appointment quickly. Castellanos, who spoke as he was lining up to enter Laredo, Texas, from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, recommended migrants avoid taking risks to cross and to use the app instead. Since it was activated for pre-screening last week, the app has been in such demand that it is telling applicants it has run out of appointments, according to Mexican officials and a dozen migrants, some of whom shared phone screenshots with Reuters. To receive a US appointment, migrants first must go to a border entry point in Mexico determined by the app. Some migrants told Reuters the app only had appointments far from where they currently are. Jose Huerta, a Venezuelan migrant in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, told Reuters the app said he could cross for his appointment from Tijuana, a city some 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) to the west opposite San Diego. “I don’t have money, now I have to walk,” he said. Traveling between border cities could expose more people to danger, and some migrant advocacy groups want the United States to provide more appointments to asylum-seekers to reduce risks. “They need to increase the number of appointments per day, we’re confident this will be the case,” said Enrique Lucero, director of migration affairs in Tijuana. US Customs and Border Protection did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Reuters about the app. – Rappler.com"

In a disclosure on Wednesday, January 18, ICTSI said its CFO, Rafael “Joel” Consing Jr. has accepted his nomination in the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Investment and Economic Affairs, and that he will be replaced by Emilio V. Pascua. ICTSI said the change is effective immediately. ”During his 15 years at ICTSI, the last seven of which as CFO, Joel Consing has made a very significant contribution to the success of the business, and we have accepted his retirement with regret. At the same time, we are happy that Joel will be moving on to an important role of national responsibility within the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. I congratulate Joel on this new role outside of ICTSI,” said ICTSI chairman and president Enrique Razon. Razon, among the wealthiest Filipino businessmen, joined Marcos in his trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. On Friday, January 20, the Palace announced that Marcos appointed Robinsons Land president and chief executive officer Frederick Go as Presidential Adviser on Investment and Economic Affairs, with Go assisting him in the presidential office. Consing has worked with Multinational Investment Bancorp., HSBC, and other financial firms. From 1993 to 1995, he was vice president and treasurer of Aboitiz & Company Incorporated and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Incorporated. He was also a director of Manila Water Incorporated, which Razon took over from the Ayalas in 2021, and a director and treasurer of Razon’s Trident Water Company Holdings Incorporated. Consing obtained his political science degree from De La Salle University in 1989. The new ICTSI CFO joined the company 10 years ago. Pascua was ICTSI’s head of mergers and acquisitions in 2020 and was made vice president for Global Mergers and Acquisitions in 2021. He held various posts in finance and business development in the container terminal industry prior to joining ICTSI. Pascua has an MBA from Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and is an alumnus of Ateneo de Manila University. Razon said Pascua’s “experience will be a great asset to the business, and we look forward to working with him to continue to deliver value to all of ICTSI’s stakeholders.” ICTSI is the world’s largest independent terminal operator.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/microsoft-job-layoffs-january-18-2023/,[],"DAVOS, Switzerland – Microsoft Corp on Wednesday, January 18, said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs and take a $1.2 billion charge to earnings, as its cloud-computing customers reassess their spending and the company braces for potential recession. The layoffs add to the tens of thousands announced in recent months across the technology sector, which has downshifted following a strong growth period during the pandemic. The news comes even as the software maker is set to ramp up spending in generative artificial intelligence that the industry sees as the new bright spot. In a note to employees, CEO Satya Nadella attempted to address the divergent outlook for different parts of the business. Customers wanted to “optimize their digital spend to do more with less” and “exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,” he said. “At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI.” Nadella said the layoffs, affecting less than 5% of Microsoft’s workforce, would conclude by the end of March, with notifications beginning Wednesday. However, Microsoft would keep hiring in “strategic areas,” he said. AI is likely to be one of those areas. Nadella this week touted AI to world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, claiming the technology would transform its products and touch people around the globe. Microsoft has looked at adding to its $1-billion stake in OpenAI, the startup behind the Silicon Valley chatbot sensation known as ChatGPT, which Microsoft plans to soon market through its cloud service. Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company ended 2% lower on Wednesday. The announcement corresponds with the start of layoffs at its retail and cloud-computing rival Amazon.com, which started notifying employees Wednesday of its own 18,000-person job cuts. In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Amazon said that affected workers in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica would be informed by the end of the day. Employees in China will be notified after the Chinese New Year. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc has announced cuts of 11,000 jobs, while cloud-based software company Salesforce Inc said it would cut 10% of its 80,000-member workforce. Overall, in 2022, more than 97,000 job cuts in tech were announced, the highest for the sector since 2002, when 131,000 cuts were announced, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “We haven’t seen this activity since the dot-com bust,” said Andrew Challenger, the company’s senior vice president. Microsoft is terminating 878 full-time workers at its Redmond headquarters, according to an update on Washington State’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) page. Under US law, most employers are required to report staff cuts affecting 50 or more workers at a single location. Microsoft’s billion-dollar charge will cut profit by 12 cents a share in the company’s second fiscal quarter this year, and could resonate beyond the tech sector, some analysts said. “Here’s one of the marquee growth companies with a very distinct user base saying that perhaps economic conditions aren’t nearly as good as we thought they were,” said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Frank Funds who has owned Microsoft stock on and off over the last several years. The charge is attributable to severance costs as well as adjustments to Microsoft’s hardware lineup and lease consolidation to build higher-density workspaces, Nadella said. Microsoft declined to detail the hardware changes or say if it would stop developing any product line. Microsoft’s cloud revenues soared in recent years from an explosion in corporate demand to host data online and handle computing in the so-called cloud. But growth slowed to 35% in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, and the company projects more cooling to come. In July last year, it said a small number of roles had been eliminated. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-not-seek-reelection/,[],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand – New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday, January 19, made a shock announcement she had “no more in the tank” to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek reelection. Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside. “This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term – because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that,” Ardern, 42, told a news conference. “I know there will be much discussion in the aftermath of this decision as to what the so called ‘real’ reason was…. The only interesting angle you will find is that after going on six years of some big challenges, that I am human,” she continued. “Politicians are human. We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.” A ruling New Zealand Labour Party vote for a new leader will take place on Sunday, January 22; the party leader will be prime minister until the next general election. Ardern’s term as leader will conclude no later than February 7 and a general election will be held on October 14. Ardern said she believed Labour would win the upcoming election. New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson, who also serves as finance minister, said in a statement he would not seek to stand as the next Labour leader. Political commentator Ben Thomas said Ardern’s announcement was a huge surprise as polls still ranked her as the country’s preferred prime minister even though support for her party had fallen from the stratospheric heights seen during the 2020 election. Thomas said that there was not a clear successor. Ardern said she was not stepping down because the job was hard, but because she believed others could do a better job. She made a point of telling her daughter Neve that she was looking forward to being there when she started school this year and told her longtime partner Clarke Gayford that it was time they married. Ardern burst onto the global scene in 2017 when she became the world’s youngest female head of government at age 37. Riding a wave of “Jacinda-mania,” she campaigned passionately for women’s rights, and an end to child poverty and economic inequality in the country. Eight months after becoming premier she became the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto. Many saw Ardern as part of wave of progressive female leaders, including Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin. Her empathetic leadership style was cemented by her response to the mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019 that killed 51 people injured 40. Ardern swiftly labeled the attacks “terrorism” and wore a hijab as she met with the Muslim community a day after the attack, telling them the whole country was “united in grief.” She promised and delivered major gun law reform within a month. “Jacinda Ardern has shown the world how to lead with intellect and strength. She has demonstrated that empathy and insight are powerful leadership qualities,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday. Ardern won plaudits across the political spectrum for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the country face some of the strictest measures globally but also resulted in one of the lowest death tolls. But her popularity has waned over the past year as inflation has risen to nearly three-decade highs, the central bank has aggressively increased the cash rate and crime has risen. The country has become increasingly politically divided over issues such as a government overhaul of water infrastructure, and the introduction of an agricultural emissions program. Ardern and Labour have seen their opinion poll support suffer. “There has been more and more criticism,” said Bryce Edwards, a political commentator and a research associate at the Institute of Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. Edwards said the appeal Ardern had won from swing voters and non-traditional Labour voters at the last election due to her handling of the COVID pandemic had started to wane as the country deals with social issues. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-19-2023/,[],"Western allies pledged billions of dollars in new weapons for Ukraine on Thursday, January 20, but the big question of whether to send heavy tanks remained unanswered, with Berlin yet to signal whether it would lift a veto. Fearing winter will give Russian forces time to regroup and unleash a major attack, Ukraine is pushing for German-made Leopard battle tanks, which are held by an array of NATO nations but whose transfer to Ukraine requires Germany’s approval. A German government source said Berlin would lift its objections if Washington sends its own Abrams tanks. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has been reluctant to send weapons seen as provoking Moscow. Many of Berlin’s Western allies say that concern is misplaced, with Russia already fully committed to war. The two countries tried to resolve the stand-off as US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the new German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius met in Berlin. But there was no word on whether they had made progress ahead of a meeting of dozens of allies on Friday at Ramstein, Washington’s main European air base. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made thinly disguised criticism of Germany for its stance on tanks. “‘I am powerful in Europe, I will help if someone else outside of Europe will also help.’ It seems to me that this is not a very correct strategy,” he said. The Ramstein meeting is billed as a chance for the West to give Ukraine what it needs to defeat Russia in 2023 and countries including Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden have already announced armoured vehicles and air defenses. But Kyiv says it needs heavy tanks to fend off Russian assaults and recapture occupied land. “We have no time, the world does not have this time,” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, wrote on Telegram on Thursday. “The question of tanks for Ukraine must be closed as soon as possible,” he said. “We are paying for the slowness with the lives of our Ukrainian people. It shouldn’t be like that.” Berlin has so far blocked allies from sending its Leopard 2 tanks, workhorse of militaries across Europe. Washington and many Western allies say the Leopards – which Germany made in the thousands during the Cold War – are the only suitable option available in big enough numbers. US officials say they have no plans yet to send the Abrams, which runs on powerful turbine engines seen as using too much fuel for Kyiv’s strained logistics system to supply at the front. Pistorius and Austin both spoke about the importance of supporting Ukraine ahead of their meeting, but neither addressed the tank issue directly. At a ceremony after being sworn in, Pistorius said: “These are not normal times, we have a war raging in Europe. Russia is waging a brutal war of annihilation on a sovereign country, on Ukraine.” Austin described Germany as one of Washington’s closest allies and thanked it for its support for Ukraine so far. Poland and Finland have already said they would send Leopards if Germany lifts its veto. In a sign of mounting frustration, Poland suggested it might do so even if Germany tries to block it. Russia has responded to the prospect of more weapons for Kyiv with threats of escalation. Dmitry Medvedev, a Vladimir Putin ally who stood in as president from 2008-2012 when Putin took a hiatus to act as prime minister, made one of Moscow’s clearest threats to use nuclear weapons if it loses in Ukraine. “The defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war,” Medvedev said. “Nuclear powers have never lost major conflicts on which their fate depends.” There have been signs of friction within Germany’s governing coalition. Scholz’s deputy Robert Habeck, from his coalition partners The Greens, said just last week that Germany would not stand in the way of other countries sending Leopards to Ukraine. Tying the Leopards to US Abrams tanks could shift the onus onto Washington. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s top policy adviser, said on Wednesday Abrams tanks were not likely to be included in Washington’s next massive $2 billion military aid package, to be headlined by Stryker and Bradley armored vehicles. “The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It’s expensive. It’s hard to train on. It has a jet engine.” Ukraine and Russia have both relied primarily on Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which have been destroyed in their hundreds in 11 months of fighting. Kyiv says better armed and protected Western tanks would give its troops the mobile firepower to drive out Russian troops in decisive battles. After big Ukrainian gains in the second half of 2022, the frontlines have largely been frozen in place over the past two months, with neither side making big gains despite heavy casualties in intense trench warfare. Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private Russian mercenary force Wagner which has taken a leading role in fighting near the eastern city of Bakhmut, claimed on Thursday his forces had seized the village of Klishchiivka on Bakhmut’s outskirts. Kyiv has previously denied that the settlement has fallen. Reuters could not confirm the situation there. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/zar-amir-ebrahimi-channelled-own-experience-iran-in-thriller-holy-spider/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – Iranian actress Zar Amir Ebrahimi, who fled her home country in 2008 in fear after a private video was leaked, says she channelled her own experience in the thriller Holy Spider, a dark tale of a serial killer in the holy city Mashhad. Based on real events from 20 years ago in the Iranian city, the film, dubbed a “Persian noir” by its director Ali Abbasi, follows builder Saeed, played by Mehdi Bajestani, as he murders local prostitutes in what he sees as a holy, cleansing mission. Amir Ebrahimi plays journalist Rahimi, who is trying to find him and suspects corruption is preventing his arrest. The actress, who lives in France, fled Iran for fear of imprisonment, lashings and a work ban after an intimate video of her was leaked. “As an Iranian woman, (Rahimi) was in me somehow. But maybe also because I have a special story in Iran, and not every actress that I know had this experience of life,” Amir Ebrahimi told Reuters ahead of the film’s UK cinema release on Friday, January 20. “I just managed to channel some details, some very intimate and personal stories that I had, especially in my last year of living in Iran – how to face government, how to face colleagues, how to face this society when it comes to judging you, when it comes to somehow trying to remove you.” The movie, which was filmed in Jordan and first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, looks at misogyny and patriarchy. “(The sex workers in the film) are human beings, they have their own stories… and I thought I’m at the same place as them. I’m maybe not that victim but I’ve been in the centre of a society judged by many people,” Amir Ebrahimi said. “I think any other Iranian woman could feel it easily,” she added. The film’s release comes as Iran’s clerical rulers have faced the biggest protests in years since September when 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the morality police who enforce strict dress codes. “I think there is a wall broken, there is a page turned and there is no way back,” Amir Ebrahimi said of the protests. “And things are going to change. It takes time, sooner or later, it costs people’s lives. But I’m pretty optimistic. I think it’s really different this time.” Holy Spider, selected as Denmark’s submission for best international feature for the Oscars, won Amir Ebrahimi the best actress award at Cannes. “That award was a message of hope, a message of justice,” she said. “And I think not only me, many Iranians and many exiled people around the world, they got this message.” – Rappler.com"

This was the experience of 52 children who got a chance to fly and see the beauty of Pampanga from above via Ultralight and Cessna aircrafts on Saturday, January 14. The Angeles City Flying Club (ACFC) chose the children of Duyan ni Maria (Cradle of Mary) Children’s Home as beneficiaries for the return of its outreach program that took a break in 2018. At the Woodland Airpark in Magalang town, the children became little pilots for a day and learned various aspects of aviation. Ten-year-old Brielle was a bundle of nerves at the start of her flight. She was euphoric after the experience. “Sa una nakakakaba pero okay na po nung tumagal na. Ganun po pala kapag nasa taas. Nakita ko yung bundok, mga bahay sa baba,” Brielle said, vibrating with glee. (I was scared at the start but okay as it went on. So that’s what it looks like up there. I saw the mountain, the houses below.) Jericho, 13, begged to repeat the experience upon landing. “Ang saya! Gusto ko pa umulit kasi maikli lang eh kaya uulit po ako. Iba po kapag nakalipad na. Natutuwa lang po talaga ako. Sana matagal (ito),” he said. (It was fun! I want to repeat this because it was so short. It’s so different once you’ve flown. I’m so happy. I hope this lasts.) Like Jerico, most of the children flew more than once. Some felt like their wildest dreams had come true. Others, like Brielle, said the experience changed the way they see the world, giving them an appreciation of perspective. Chasing after candies dropped from planes onto green fields was another special treat. The ACFC, a private, members-only aviation club, has been flying with disadvantaged children from different organizations since 2010. ACFC president Tonet Rivera and general manager Will Staughton said the program aims to encourage and build interest in young children as well as raise aviation awareness. “This event is part of our outreach program. It is our first time to have these kids come here who are orphans. We want to give them something they would never have and encourage them in aviation. Because you know, we’ll never know,” said Rivera. “Angeles City Flying Club, as a private organization, is committed to encouraging people to be sports pilots in the Philippines. About two or three times a year, we do days where we try to introduce young people to aviation,” Staughton added. Woodland Hotel owner Gordon Boyce started the ACFC in 1993 when he bought an aircraft to provide guests with an addiitional perk. The club now has 155 members. Former photojournalist and advertising photographer John Chua, who passed away in 2018, suggested sharing the aviation experience with disadvantaged children through an outreach program. “We want to reach out to young kids, disadvantaged kids especially. We used to hold events like this to those with autism, ADHD, hearing impaired children who belong to different organizations also,” said Rivera. “Because they loved the experience, they still talk about it. Some of them are into photography, they are now photography enthusiasts.” Rivera said the children received a pre-flight briefing. Their safety, he said, is as important as the experience, allowing them to learn more about flying while appreciating the beauty of nature. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/nato-chief-calls-significant-boost-arms-ukraine/,[],"DAVOS, Switzerland – Ukraine needs a “significant increase” in weapons at a pivotal moment in Russia’s invasion and such support is the only way to a negotiated peaceful solution, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, January 18. Defense leaders from around 50 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will hold talks at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base on Friday, the latest in a series of meetings since Russian forces swept into Ukraine nearly 11 months ago. “This is a pivotal moment in the war and the need for a significant increase in support for Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “If we want a negotiated peaceful solution tomorrow we need to provide more weapons today.” The focus in Ramstein is expected to be not on what the United States will provide but on whether Germany will lift its opposition to sending its Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve their transfer from allied countries. Stoltenberg remained cautious on the subject, saying consultations were continuing, although he welcomed a British decision to dispatch Challenger tanks to Kyiv. This week, Britain raised the pressure on Berlin by becoming the first Western country to send Western tanks, pledging a squadron of 14 Challengers, but the Leopards are seen as the best choice to supply Ukraine with a large-scale tank force. Kyiv says it hopes new Western weapons will give it fresh military momentum this year, especially heavy tanks which would provide its troops more mobility and protection to push through Russian lines in the east and south of the country. Beyond tanks, Stoltenberg said Ukraine needed more air defense systems and armor but also ammunition, spare parts and maintenance capabilities to ensure that its existing weapons continued to function. He said the situation along battlefronts had stabilized over the past weeks, but that the protracted fierce fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut demonstrated the importance of providing more weapons to support Ukraine. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on the city’s northern outskirts. “(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin has shown no sign of preparing for peace and therefore he must realize he cannot win on the battlefield,” Stoltenberg added. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/church-of-england-bishops-refuse-allow-same-sex-marriages/,[],"LONDON, England – The Church of England will refuse to allow same-sex couples to get married in its churches under proposals set out on Wednesday, January 18, in which the centuries-old institution said it would stick to its teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman. The proposals were developed by bishops, who form one of three parts of Church’s governing body known as the General Synod, after the Church of England’s six-year consultation on sexuality and marriage – among other subjects – and will be put to the General Synod at a meeting next month. The Church of England, is central to the wider Anglican communion which represents over 85 million people in over 165 countries. “Same-sex couples would still not be able to get married in a Church of England church,” the statement said, confirming a BBC report overnight that bishops had refused to support a change in teaching to allow priests to marry gay couples. Under the proposals, same-sex couples could have a service in which there would be “prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God’s blessing on the couple” in church after a civil marriage. Gay marriage was legalized in Britain in 2013. Still, the prayers would be voluntary for clergy to use and could be used in combinations “reflecting the theological diversity of the Church,” the Church of England said, implying spiritual leaders could choose not to offer such blessings. “I am under no illusions that what we are proposing today will appear to go too far for some and not nearly far enough for others, but it is my hope that what we have agreed will be received in a spirit of generosity, seeking the common good,” said Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Separately, Church of England bishops will be issuing an apology later this week to LGBTQI+ people for the “rejection, exclusion and hostility” they have faced in churches, according to the statement. The Church of England, which was founded in 1534, has been divided for years on how to deal with same-sex marriages, with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists fighting for the same rights as heterosexual Christians. Seeking to address the contentious issue, Welby called on the bishops last year to “abound in love for all,” even as he backed the validity of a resolution passed in 1998 that rejected “homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-appoints-naida-angping-ambassador-france-january-2023/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – In early December 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. granted Naida Angping’s leave after she asked for “personal time for herself and her family.” Just a little over a month later, the former Presidential Management Staff (PMS) chief and long-time aide to the Marcos-Romualdez clan is ending the “time off” she had wanted for a plum post in Paris as the Philippines’ ambassador to France. Angping’s nomination to the post was forwarded to the Commission on Appointments on Tuesday, January 17. According to the Commission on Appointments, she was appointed on January 13, 2023. She has not held a diplomatic post before this. Angping, if confirmed, will take the place of Ambassador Junever Mahilum-West, a career diplomat who had only been appointed to the post in October 2021. Mahilum-West herself announced she was leaving the post on Thursday night, January 11 (Manila time), through a public post on Facebook. “Enjoyed Paris too briefly,” Mahilum-West said, adding her next assignment would be in Vancouver, Canada. The Philippines currently has a consulate in Vancouver, which had been led by another career diplomat, Maria Andrelita Austria. Austria was recently confirmed as the Philippines’ ambassador to Canada in December 2022. She will hold office in the Philippine embassy in Ottawa. Angping is no stranger to politics, especially in relation to the President’s family. A former Manila congresswoman, she was a long-time aide to the late Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, the father of House Speaker Martin Romualdez. Kokoy is the brother of former first lady Imelda Marcos, the President’s mother. When the then-Marcos transition team first announced Angping’s appointment as PMS chief, they hyped her experience as aide to the late Kokoy Romualdez, who was once the country’s envoy to the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia. She was also his aide when Kokoy Romualdez was Leyte governor. During the 2022 campaign, Angping served as Marcos’ “disbursing officer,” the President himself said in a leaked video of his speech at his victory party with campaign staff. That she was picked to head the PMS – an office tasked to help the President make well-informed decision, follow-up on tasks assigned to key officials, and set the agenda for Cabinet meetings – isn’t surprising, given her ties to the Marcos-Romualdez clan. But mere months in her new role, there was also talk among Malacañang insiders that the PMS chief was not performing, and was frequently absent, save for her appearance in Marcos’ public events. Her leave came after her husband Harry Angping, himself a former legislator, was allegedly caught harassing a staff member of a Bangkok hotel where Marcos and his delegation were billeted during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok. The Palace then – and even until now – refused to comment on the reports. Only a high-ranking official, speaking only on background, denied the supposed arrest of the PMS chief’s husband. Thai police denied the arrest as well. Prior to Angping’s appointment as ambassador, Malacañang was mum on her status, even as a new executive order “streamlined” the offices under the Office of the President. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/sports/rafael-nadal-destroyed-mentally-after-another-injury-setback/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Rafa Nadal said he would plot a path back to the tour once he has a firm prognosis for the troubling hip problem that cut short his Australian Open, while conceding the growing weight of injuries was taking a heavy toll. Nadal’s title defense ended bitterly on Wednesday as he slumped to an injury-hampered 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 second-round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald at Rod Laver Arena, the latest chapter in a long history of fitness problems at Melbourne Park. The 22-time Grand Slam champion arrived undercooked, with rib, abdomen, and foot injuries having kept him off court for much of the season after Wimbledon last year. He lost both of his matches in the United Cup for Spain in the lead-up and scraped through the first round against Jack Draper when the young Briton suffered cramping on a hot afternoon. Though Nadal has won only two matches since the US Open in September, the 36-year-old found positives out of his trip to Australia. “I mean, hopefully it’s nothing too bad. In the end (it has) been three positive weeks in terms of practice,” he told reporters. “So I really hope that (injury) doesn’t put me out of the court for a long time, because then it’s tough to make all the recovery again. “It’s not only the recovery. It’s all the amount of work that you need to put together to come back at a decent level.” With Nadal eliminated, his great rival Novak Djokovic can match the Spaniard’s 22 Grand Slam titles with a 10th crown at Melbourne Park. “In the end, I can’t complain about my life at all,” said Nadal. “So just in terms of sports and in terms of injuries and tough moments, I mean, that’s another one. “Just can’t say that I am not destroyed mentally at this time, because I will be lying.” Nadal has long feared injuries will curtail his career but always found a way back from the low points to achieve more success. He left no one in doubt he still had the fuel for another comeback. “It’s a very simple thing: I like what I do. I like playing tennis,” he said. “I know it’s not forever. I like to feel myself competitive. I like to fight for the things that I have been fighting for almost half of my life or even more. “It’s not that complicated to understand.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-presidential-contender-wants-peace-with-china/,[],"TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwan Vice President William Lai pledged on Wednesday, January 18, to maintain the peaceful status quo with China but also to defend Taiwan, as he took the helm at the ruling party ahead of an expected presidential run. Lai was elected the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) new chairman on Sunday, after President Tsai Ing-wen resigned as chairwoman in November following the DPP’s trouncing at local elections. Lai is widely expected to be the party’s candidate for president in the early 2024 election, though he has not formally accepted the nomination. Tsai cannot run again as president due to constitutional term limits. As in the last election, which the DPP won handily by promising to stand up to China, relations with Beijing are likely to top the agenda for 2024, especially as China ramps up pressure to get Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. Speaking to reporters after officially taking over as party chairman, Lai said facing the threat from China, the DPP’s mission was to protect Taiwan, but that peace was the common expectation of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. “We will use our best efforts to maintain the status quo of regional peace and stability,” he said, adding that peace also depends on national defense. Lai angered China in 2018 while he was premier, telling parliament he was a “Taiwan independence worker” and that his position was that Taiwan was a sovereign, independent country – a red line for Beijing. Asked about those comments, Lai said he was committed to following Tsai’s policy that includes stating only Taiwan’s people can decide their future, and that the Republic of China – Taiwan’s formal name – and the People’s Republic of China are “not subordinate to each other”. “The pragmatic acceptance is that Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country, and there is no need to separately declare Taiwan independence,” he added. China has refused to talk to Tsai since she first took office in 2016, believing her to be a separatist. Tsai says that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an independent country already, and Beijing has no right to claim it. Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang or KMT which traditionally favors close ties with Beijing, has not decided on its presidential candidate yet. A Tuesday poll published by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation showed Lai leading, but only slightly, over Hou Yu-ih, the KMT mayor of New Taipei city, considered by party sources a potential frontrunner as their candidate.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-protest-measure-turnover-schools-calendar-pnp/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – Students and academics on Wednesday, January 18 protested against a proposed city ordinance that would require schools to turn over to the Cebu City Police Office (CCPO) their calendars of activities. Youth and student organizations and some civil society groups rallied in front of the Cebu City Hall legislative building while the city council held a public hearing on Councilor Jose Lorenzo Abellanosa’s proposed “Anti-Gun Violence and School Safety Ordinance of Cebu City”. The students also protested how UP Student Council chairperson Cleisteil Cimafranca’s presentation at the public hearing was cut short as she detailed former events that strengthen apprehensions on the measure. “It is not their scope of work or responsibility to focus on academic calendars,” Cimafranca said at the protest. “This is just a ploy for them to get information about students,” she added, speaking in Bisaya. The introductory note to the proposed ordinance cites the need to afford greater protection to schools, teachers, students, and their families from the threats of gun violence. The proposed measure is presented as “the primary policy for public order and safety to protect schools and universities from all forms of lawlessness, criminality, and other threats to peace and order.” Section 6 of the measure requires schools to submit their calendar of activities for the academic year to the CCPO and PNP within 15 days before the beginning of every school year. Schools would also have to submit a list and designated time of school events, and the expected number of attendees, at least one week before an event. The All UP Academic Employees Union also rejected the proposed ordinance, warning that it would “curtail the academic freedom of institutions of learning which is enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.” It called the measure an attempt to institute a “surveillance mechanism and police state localization.” The group described the proposed ordinance as “an Owellian license to implant 1984 in Cebu City,” a reference to George Orwell’s 1949 science fiction novel about a dystopian society under continual surveillance. “If the city government and the CCPO are indeed concerned with the safety and security of the academic community in Cebu City, they can start by giving a thorough and impartial investigation (into) the abduction of University of the Philippines Cebu lecturer Armand Jake Dayoha and April Dyan Gumanao,” the organization said. Cimafranca was cut off as she was explaining why students are wary off the CCPO, citing the February 2021 raid on the University of San Carlos Talamban Campus against a supposed Lumad guerrilla training camp. What the USC hosted was a school for child refugees of conflict that many academics in the city supported. The UP Cebu student council head and the All UP Academic Employees Union also pointed out other instances where police violated the state university’s academic freedom by cracking down on campus protests over social and political issues. Kei Galon, Anakbayan Cebu chairperson said faculty and students alike fear the measure  “might lead to unwarranted surveillance by state forces in learning institutions and impinge on academic freedom, free thought and expression, especially with the long and extensive accounts on red-tagging forums in schools and the Cebu 8 incident on June 5, 2020, where students were arrested in UP Cebu.” With Jacqueline Hernandez/ Rappler.com"

Saudi Arabia launched “Vision 2030” in 2016, an economic agenda to cut oil dependence and build new industries while investing in existing ones including energy and petrochemicals. The kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has pushed social reforms alongside the economic agenda to help modernize the kingdom, in recent years allowing women to drive, music concerts, and cinemas for the first time. “In the past, these were seen as hopeful by-products of an economic transformation.

But today we see justice being done. We see judges drawing a line. We see freedom being upheld,” Clooney said. The international lawyer, who began representing Ressa in 2019, said the legal cases filed against the veteran journalist and Rappler were filed “in an attempt to silence a journalist.” “For four years my client has had a 30-year sentence hanging over her head while the Philippine courts considered the spurious charges filed against her,” Clooney said. Clooney expressed hope the verdict would “be the beginning of a new chapter in the Philippines in which journalists are safe, speech is free, democracy is secured and the rule of law can prevail.” The CTA 1st Division decided to acquit Ressa and RHC, Rappler’s holding company, on the Duterte government’s charge that it evaded tax payments when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors North Base Media and Omidyar Network. This involved the issuance to the two entities of Philippine Depositary Receipts or PDRs. “Today marks a vital legal victory for Maria Ressa, our indefatigable client, and for Rappler.

https://www.rappler.com/business/airbus-boeing-jet-delivery-delays-spark-penalties-battle/,[],"DUBLIN, Ireland – A battle for compensation is brewing over delays in the delivery of commercial jets, with a Dublin aviation summit descending into a blame game over the worst industrial disruption in years. Airbus and Boeing are on average delivering new jetliners three to six months late, blaming post-pandemic havoc in supply chains, delegates at two major aviation finance conferences said. Powerful leasing companies heaped pressure on planemakers over the delays, with Air Lease executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy telling this week’s Airline Economics conference that manufacturers had “grossly misjudged” their output. Airbus and Boeing defended their record, saying the situation is the result of a mix of factors, from the pandemic to weak supply chains, and a sudden snapback in travel demand. The public exchanges reflect the battle lines in negotiations behind the scenes over whether manufacturers should bear contractual responsibility by paying penalties, even when suppliers are at fault, people involved in the discussions said. With January already marked by fresh delay notices being sent to airlines and leasing companies, experts said millions of dollars of exposure are riding on one word: “excusable.” Aircraft contracts contain dense descriptions of adverse factors which excuse manufacturers for multiple types of delay, meaning they can avoid paying penalties or “liquidated damages.” Excusable delays include “acts of God,” natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquakes, and epidemics, among other examples, according to extracts of past contracts filed with regulators. They may give the manufacturer a get-out in the event of a failure to obtain parts. Wars and strikes are also excusable. Non-excusable delays include anything that falls outside this catalogue, but are rare, experts say. Only the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX over design defects was treated as a non-excusable delay on a significant scale, resulting in hefty compensation payments from Boeing, industry sources said. With last year’s deliveries below target and doubts rising over 2023, planemakers are once again invoking the “excusable delay” clause, buyers said. Airbus and Boeing declined comment on contractual matters. But three years after the early spread of COVID-19, with demand now surging and China coming back onto the market, lessors used their annual summit to argue enough is enough. “They are not excusable at all,” Aengus Kelly, chief executive of lease giant AerCap, told the Airfinance Journal conference when asked about the delays. “[Manufacturers] were just wildly over-optimistic in what they could produce. They are trying to blame COVID but COVID has long gone.” France ended a COVID-related state of emergency last July. The World Health Organization said last month there were “still too many uncertainties and gaps for us to say the pandemic is over,” but added it hoped to declare the emergency over in 2023. Tensions have been exacerbated by the increasingly short notice for delays, lessors said. Filling the gap may involve getting jets out of storage, which means facing maintenance bills and bottlenecks in repair shops. The amount of damages at stake varies from contract to contract, but one buyer said typical exposure in the event of inexcusable delays could reach $20,000 a day for single-aisle jets, rising up to a ceiling of $2 million to $3 million per plane. Even so, that may not mean a cash windfall. Jetmakers prefer to offer credits and large buyers have the scope to renegotiate earlier deals. “I think it is more likely that there is some other form of concession from the manufacturers. Whether it crosses the line of a liquidated damages payment…is part of an overall commercial discussion,” said Andy Cronin, chief executive of leasing company Avolon. “But if it persists I wouldn’t rule it out,” he told Reuters. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/how-court-tax-appeals-ruled-favor-maria-ressa-holdings-corporation-january-2023/,['LIAN BUAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) acquitted Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation, of four counts of tax violations, giving the embattled news organization some breathing space with still three court charges left to face, including a pending closure order. A unanimous ruling by the 1st Division of the tax court disputed the Duterte government’s charge that Rappler evaded taxes when it raised capital for the company through the often-used financial instrument called Philippine Depositary Receipts or PDRs. Rappler’s lawyers said it is the first time in at least 20 years that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) interpreted PDRs as taxable income, and the first time that a media company is being charged of tax evasion over PDRs which other prominent media companies like ABS-CBN and GMA Network also use. The CTA’s ruling is 81 pages long, penned by Associate Justice Catherine Manahan with concurrences from Associate Justices Jean Marie Bacorro-Villena and Marian Ivy Reyes-Fajardo. The Duterte-time BIR, and eventually the Department of Justice (DOJ), said that when Rappler issued the PDRs to foreign investors North Base Media and Omidyar Network, the news company: The company being charged is Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC), the holding company of the subsidiary, Rappler Inc., which is the news organization. The CTA said that RHC did not act as a dealer in securities because the tax code defines a dealer in securities as one regularly engaged in such activity. “The evidence on record shows that accused RHC was not habitually or regularly engaged in the purchase and re-sale of securities,” said the CTA. The CTA added: “The issuance of PDRs by RHC was done pursuant to a legitimate business purpose, i.e., to raise capital for its subsidiary Rappler Inc., which is consistent with one of the purposes of RHC as a holding company.” Is the issuance of a PDR taxable event? The CTA first defined PDRs as an instrument that does not make the holder – in this case the foreign investors – an owner of a share of stock. Instead, the PDR “grants the holder the right to the delivery of sale of the underlying share.” “They are not statements nor are they certificates of ownership of a corporation,” said the CTA. In short, a PDR gives the holder the option to buy the underlying share on the condition that it is allowed to. But media companies must be 100% Filipino owned. Upon examination of the CTA, it found that foreign investors North Base Media (NBM) and Omidyar Network (ON) did not avail of the option to buy underlying shares. “The process whereby the PDRs were issued to NBM and ON reveals that it did not involve a sale of shares of stock but were investment transactions,” said the CTA. The PDRs remained an investment tool, and remained an option for the foreign investors to buy underlying shares “once Philippine law allows.” “This is the rationale of placing the underlying shares with an escrow agent in the meantime, as described in the PDR instrument, because the holders thereof may not exercise the option of owning the shares and just remain as investors,” said the CTA. The tax court further said that “it is not repugnant to the nature of a holding company to engage in financial activities to raise capital for its subsidiaries.” Because the tax court found that “there is nothing in the wordings of the PDR instruments and the PDR subscription agreements that would show that the foreign entitties NBM and ON will become owners of the shares of stock of Rappler Inc. upon the issuance of the PDRs,” the justices ruled that there was therefore no sale, and therefore, no taxable income. The tax court said, “RHC did not earn any trading income from the issuance of PDRs to foreign entities.” “Having determined the non-taxability of the issuance of PDRs to NBM and ON, the Court concludes that the aforementioned elements of the crime charged under [the tax code] are not present….As discussed, no gain or income was realized by accused in the subject transactions,” said the tax court. Rappler’s lawyer Francis Lim, former president of the Philippine Stock Exchange, said that the judgment in favor of Rappler benefits all businesses which legally raise capital, and in trickle, the economy. “We do need investments here in the country to help the country emerge from the pandemic, and a contrary decision that they could have written would have negative implications not only on the freedom of the press but the economy,” said Lim. Ressa and Rappler still face a closure order by the quasi-judicial agency Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is undergoing new rounds of appeals at the Court of Appeals. Ressa’s cyber libel conviction which has potential prisontime of at least six years is being appealed at the Supreme Court. – Rappler.com"

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, he said the talks with Beijing also covered the topic of factories, and other products including cancer treatments. “What I really want to understand is how do we help the Chinese government as to what are the needs they have from a healthcare standpoint,” he said. He gave no further details, but said he hoped to visit China this year. Beijing has so far insisted on using only Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines for its own population, but the country is beset by a raging COVID outbreak following a U-turn from Beijing on previously ultra-tight anti-pandemic curbs. Health experts fear the outbreak could intensify in areas less well equipped to handle it, as millions of Chinese living in cities head to their hometowns this week for the Lunar New Year holidays. China-made COVID vaccines are of the inactivated virus type and not based on the messenger RNA technology used in the most widely used shots developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. The only foreign shots being used in China are BioNTech doses shipped by Germany late last year and being given to its citizens living there. The go-ahead to allow expatriate Germans to get a BioNTech shot came as cases surge since Beijing dismantled the zero-COVID lockdown regime. As regards cancer treatments, Moderna has been working with Merck on an experimental vaccine against melanoma based on the mRNA technology used in successful COVID-19 vaccines. The company has said it plans to study the approach it has used in lung and other highly mutated cancers. Earlier, in a WEF panel discussion, Bancel said he would like to have factories making vaccines based on its messenger RNA technology on every continent as the US company prepares to build four facilities. The company, whose COVID-19 vaccines are made in the United States and Switzerland, is building or planning to build plants in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Kenya, he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-legislature-approves-presidents-resignation-amid-graft-crackdown/,[],"HANOI, Vietnam – Vietnam’s legislature on Wednesday approved the resignation of President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, state media reported, amid a major escalation of the Southeast Asian country’s anti-graft campaign. Vice-President Vo Thi Anh Xuan would be acting president, state media said. Sources said a new president is likely to be named at the next meeting of the National Assembly in May. The Communist Party’s central committee said on Tuesday that Phuc, 68, had submitted his resignation after the ruling Communist Party blamed him for “violations and wrongdoings” by officials under his control while prime minister. Phuc was ultimately responsible for offences committed by many officials, including two deputy prime ministers and three ministers, when he was prime minister from 2016 to 2021, the central party committee said. Wednesday’s vote by the rubber-stamp National Assembly is largely a procedural step, after the party’s Central Committee on Tuesday said it accepted Phuc’s resignation. Reuters could not reach Phuc for comment. Some Vietnam-based diplomats and foreign officials said the new developments could cause uncertainty, which may affect foreign investment. Political stability has been a major draw for foreign companies investing in Vietnam. The country is poised to be among the top beneficiaries of global companies’ plans to reduce exposure to China which has been rocked by Beijing’s COVID strategy and trade tensions with the United States. “The ousted state president was more business-oriented than many in the top levels of government, but his forced departure should not be seen as a shift away from economic liberalisation and openness to foreign investment,” said John Marrett, senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Dominic Scrivens, founder and chairman of investment fund Dragon Capital, said he believed “the height of the anti-corruption (drive) is now behind us”. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said he was confident “that the positive momentum in our relationship” would continue. The United States is Vietnam’s largest export market. Phuc, who had held the largely ceremonial post of president since 2021, was also been ousted from the powerful Politburo and from the post of chairman of the national defence and security council. Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four “pillars” – the party’s secretary, the president, prime minister and speaker of the house. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/paolo-gentiloni-says-europe-must-seize-catch-up-chance-world-economic-forum-davos-2023/,[],"DAVOS, Switzerland – An improved economic outlook gives Europe the chance to double down on efforts to boost its industrial competitiveness in key sectors from clean energy to semiconductors, EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Wednesday, January 18. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gentiloni said the bloc could avoid an all-out recession this year and get away with what he called a “limited contraction” of the economy in the first quarter. “The key word of the moment is shallow,” Gentiloni told Reuters, using that word to characterize the depth of any recession a few weeks before the commission releases its new economic forecasts. While he noted “enormous risks” such as the Ukraine war to Europe’s short-term fortunes, he said the fall in energy prices, the fact that inflation appeared to have peaked late last year, and relatively buoyant labor markets gave cause for hope. Gentiloni noted that the region had thus far avoided its worst fears of a year ago, namely that energy snags would result in mass blackouts for business and consumers, corporate bankruptcies, and large-scale social unrest. “Overall this less pessimistic outlook should encourage us in the difficult path we have,” he said, referring to short-term challenges such as safeguarding next winter’s energy supplies while making the economy more resilient and green in the long term. Gentiloni acknowledged differences between EU capitals on how to fund a new green deal unveiled by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, January 17, but urged those countries to first define the purpose and scope of the effort. “We should avoid starting from the end of the discussion. We know that common funding for the EU is always difficult to address,” he said, urging capitals first to accept the principle that this should be a joint EU effort and to work out what the priority projects should be. Gentiloni identified semiconductors and areas such as green hydrogen as possible areas of priority, citing the need for joint EU projects to achieve the levels of scale required for a bloc of 450 million citizens. Europe has in recent months become more pragmatic about its dealings with China amid concerns ranging from human rights to Beijing’s interpretation of trade rules. Gentiloni said that was leading to a new readiness to envisage industrial cooperation at EU level to make the bloc less dependent on others. “Five to 10 years ago, industrial policy at European level was taboo,” he said. “The challenge that China is making every day more clear is that we have to catch up in some sectors if we want this famous strategic autonomy in coming years.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-results-coco-gauff-emma-raducanu-january-18-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Coco Gauff battled past Emma Raducanu, 6-3, 7-6(4), on Wednesday, January 18, to reach the third round of the Australian Open, but not before the two prodigies offered fans a good glimpse of what the future of women’s tennis could look like after an absorbing first clash. A lot is expected of French Open runner-up Gauff, who at 18 is two years younger than Raducanu but has not tasted the Grand Slam success the Briton did as a teenager, and the seventh seed saved three breakpoints to win a first set she controlled. Handed a primetime slot on Rod Laver Arena following the retirements last year of champion Ash Barty and 23-time major winner Serena Williams, the torchbearers of a new era pushed each other hard before Gauff edged ahead in the second set. Having returned from an ankle injury suffered in a warm-up event in Auckland, Raducanu was troubled by an abs problem after being broken at 2-1 and Gauff pounced, before fending off a late fightback by the 2021 Flushing Meadows champion to prevail. “I just told myself to hang in there,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “Emma was playing really good tennis towards the end of the match and the whole match was great. “In the beginning we both started off rocky but I think the match was good quality for the most part. Considering the circumstances, both of us were nervous. “This was a long anticipated match since the draw came out so I’m glad the match was good for you guys.” The victory – American Gauff’s 100th on the WTA Tour since her professional debut four years ago – also made her the first women’s player to reach the milestone before turning 19 since former Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki in 2009. For Raducanu, it meant her wait to reach the third round of a Grand Slam since her US Open triumph continued, as the world No. 77 struggles on the big stage amid injury woes and coaching changes. Her participation at the year’s first major had looked in doubt in the aftermath of her ankle issue, with Raducanu saying that she had “expedited” her recovery. “Kudos to Emma – she had a tough week in Auckland,” Gauff added. “So it’s good for her to be able to play this level after such a scary moment.” Gauff next takes on the winner of the match between fellow American Bernarda Pera and China’s Zheng Qinwen, hoping to win and match her best run at Melbourne Park three years ago. There was less tension in the other women’s match earlier as Iga Swiatek, hot favorite for the women’s title, overcame Camila Osorio, 6-2, 6-3, under the roof on Rod Laver Arena. “It’s not easy because with that number the expectations are a little bit higher from outside, but also for myself a little bit,” said the top-ranked Swiatek. “I’m trying to manage that properly. Also trying to kind of stay in my bubble during the tournament so I’m not going to get distracted by all of that. “I don’t want people to take for granted that if you’re world No. 1 that you’re going to win everything because we still have to fight for every match.” The 21-year-old inherited the top ranking when Barty retired shortly after winning last year’s Australian Open and quickly proved worthy of the mantle, winning eight titles in 2022. Rain kept the players off the outer courts throughout the day session, however, adding to fixture congestion triggered by extreme heat and storms on Tuesday when nine matches did not get started and two could not be completed. Greek sixth seed Maria Sakkari had a scare on Margaret Court Arena against 18-year-old Diana Shnaider and was forced to come from a set down to beat the Russian teenager, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, over more than two 1/2 hours. “It was a very high level from both of us, she played an amazing match, she’s very talented, very promising,” said Sakkari, before joking that Shnaider should consider giving up her college eligibility in the United States and turn professional. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/davos-2023-ceo-buzz-chatgpt-style-ai-world-economic-forum/,[],"Business titans trudging through Alpine snow can’t stop talking about a chatbot from San Francisco. Generative artificial intelligence, tech that can invent virtually any content someone can think up and type into a text box, is garnering not just venture investment in Silicon Valley but interest in Davos at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting this week. Defining the category is ChatGPT, a chatbot that the startup called OpenAI released in November. The tech works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer any prompt by a user in a human-like way, offering information like a search engine would or prose like an aspiring novelist. Executives have floated wide-ranging applications for the nascent technology, from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for AI and military supremacy. Conference goers with a major stake in the development of the technology include Microsoft, whose chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the tech’s progress has not been linear. AI capabilities will “completely transform” all of Microsoft’s products, he said in an on-stage interview with the Wall Street Journal. Microsoft has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. In an announcement that coincided with the conference, Microsoft said it plans to market ChatGPT to its cloud-computing customers. The company has also worked to add OpenAI’s image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc’s Google. Later on Tuesday, the political sphere gets to weigh in on the craze. French politician Jean-Noël Barrot planned to join a panel discussion with a Sony Group Corp. executive on the technology’s impact. Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare Inc, a company that defends websites against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, sees generative AI as good enough to be a junior programmer or a “really good thought partner.” In an interview, Prince said Cloudflare was using such technology to write code on its Workers platform. Cloudflare is also exploring how such tech can answer inquiries faster for its free-tier customers as well, he said on the annual meeting’s sidelines. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies Inc., a software provider helping governments visualize an army’s movements or enterprises vet their supply chains, among other tasks, said such AI could have military applications. Karp told Reuters in Davos, “The idea that an autonomous thing could generate results is basically obviously useful for war.” The country that advances the fastest in AI capabilities is “going to define the law of the land,” Karp said, adding that it was worth asking how tech would play a role in any conflict with China. Businesses including CarMax Inc. have already used Microsoft and OpenAI’s tech, such as to generate thousands of customer review summaries when marketing used vehicles. Proposed venture-capital investment has also exceeded what some startups want to take. Such buzz carried through gatherings at Davos, like talk about a slide-generating bot dubbed ChatBCG after the management consulting firm. The service said on its website that it had too much demand to keep operating. Generative AI is “a game-changer that society and industry need to be ready for,” stated an article on the World Economic Forum’s website. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/small-medium-companies-expected-boost-corporate-travel-rebound-2023/,[],"New York excavation contractor Brian Dietz does not view higher air fares as a deal-breaker for flying and airlines are seeing more small and medium size companies like his feeding a 2023 rebound in business travel. The joint owner of family-run Bob Dietz & Sons is not thrilled about higher fares but plans to fly for meetings and to a March trade show despite rising costs, economic uncertainty, and a recent wave of flight cancellations. When it comes to evaluating heavy machinery, nothing compares to in-person. “You want to touch it, you want to sit in it, you want to operate it,” Dietz said. “You can’t do that on Zoom.” Global airlines are expected to return to profitability this year for the first time since 2019, fueled by demand for leisure trips, according to trade group International Air Transport Association. Also helping is expected demand from financial services companies and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) like Dietz’s, according to industry officials and various surveys. Booking activity by SMEs hit 80% of 2019 levels during the third quarter of 2022, 19 percentage points above multinational corporations, according to American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT). Although business travelers often book economy seats, corporate travel is critical for airlines because it means more frequent flyers and appetite for higher-margin premium fares. Delta Air Lines recently said it had its highest days for corporate bookings since the start of the pandemic, with corporate domestic sales recovering to 80% of 2019 levels. SME executives were some of the first business travelers back on planes after the pandemic-induced slump. They have since emerged as the fastest-growing segment within corporate travel according to Amex GBT. “The recovery by SMEs has far outpaced the recovery by the multinationals,” said Jeremy Quek, a consultant at Amex GBT. Spending on business travel globally is expected to recover to 80% of 2019 levels in 2023, up from 65% in 2022, according to the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA). North America is expected to experience the sharpest rebound with compound annual growth increases of 23.4% to $363.7 billion by 2026, the GBTA said. According to average fares paid by Amex GBT clients on US domestic routes, the cost of first and business class rose by 11% during the second half of 2022 compared with the same period in 2019, while coach prices grew 4%. Strong demand in recent months, coupled with industry-wide capacity constraints, such as aircraft delivery delays and pilot shortages, have enabled US airlines to hike fares. Dietz flies premium economy for shorter trips, business class for longer flights, and plans to travel every other month. He said he is watching to see if the industry can avoid a repeat of this month’s Federal Aviation Administration system outage and last month’s systems meltdown by Southwest Airlines, both of which stranded thousands of passengers. “Our time is valuable,” he said, “so I can’t sit at an airport.” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/national-privacy-commission-clears-comelec-smartmatic-violation-breach-2022/,['DWIGHT DE LEON'],"MANILA, Philippines – The National Privacy Commission (NPC) said the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and software provider Smartmatic were not liable of violating the Data Privacy Act, in connection with a server breach that gripped the electronic voting firm in the run-up to the 2022 elections. The NPC dismissed the complaint against the Comelec and Smartmatic in a decision dated September 22, 2022, but the Comelec said it was only notified about the decision on Tuesday, January 17. The Comelec subsequently notified the media on Wednesday, January 18. The NPC later clarified, “September 22 is the date of the adjudication meeting, and the drafting, review, and mailing process is the reason why it only reached the Comelec now.” The ruling also recommended prosecution only for certain individuals: the rogue Smartmatic employee who shared his credentials to someone he met via FB Messenger, and that third-party individual who bribed the fired staff. The Comelec was put in hot water in January 2022 after a Manila Bulletin report claimed that hackers supposedly breached the poll body’s servers. The commission eventually denied this. Two months later, the Senate electoral reforms panel insisted there really was a data breach, but involving Smartmatic’s servers. The National Bureau of Investigation said in April that Smartmatic employee Ricardo Argana whose laptop had access to the company’s network gave his credentials to someone who contacted him via FB Messenger (a certain Winston Steward) in exchange for cash. Smartmatic told a Senate panel that the staff had been fired, but insisted no data in connection with the 2022 elections were affected. In its decision in September, the NPC said it did not find the Comelec and Smartmatic liable of deliberately concealing security breaches involving sensitive personal information, an act punishable under the Data Privacy Act. In order for the Comelec and Smartmatic to be held liable, three factors must have been present: (1) a personal data breach occurred, (2) the breach is one that requires notification to the commission, and (3) the person knowingly conceals the fact of such a breach from the commission. “The [NPC] notes that there is no evidence on record that shows that there was a lack of reasonable and appropriate security measures that could have resulted in the breach. Smartmatic’s servers or system being breached was caused by employee malfeasance,” the ruling read. Argana, Steward, and other unknown individuals, however, are liable of committing intentional breach or unauthorized access under the Data Privacy Act, the NPC said. “[T]hey broke into Smartmatic’s servers that store personal or sensitive personal information. These individuals are recommended for prosecution to the Department of Justice,” the ruling read. The 2022 elections concluded with Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte elected president and vice president, respectively. While there have been reports of election day irregularities, there is so far no compelling evidence to determine that the automated polls have been rigged. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/william-dar-says-pricey-onions-result-poor-planning-smuggling/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Onion prices, which had already reached over P700 per kilo, would never have skyrocketed if only the Department of Agriculture (DA) had allowed timely imports, according to former DA secretary William Dar. “It’s a timing issue. When you only decide to bring in imports because the prices are rising, then it will be a much harder process,” said Dar in an ANC Headstart interview on Wednesday, January 18. Dar said that the DA most likely had done anticipatory planning, but had nonetheless failed to bring in imports on time. “In August, they should have decided early September to now bring in how many metric tons of onions to cover the deficiency,” Dar said. “It’s too late, and you can only do so much. It will go down, but not as much as you like it to be. “ The DA – currently headed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. – had approved the importation of yellow and red onions totaling 21,060 metric tons early in January 2023. Importers were given until January 27 to bring the onions into the country. The decision, however, has been met with fierce criticism for its poor timing. Farmers’ groups pointed out that imports are now set to clash with the harvest season. Traders can now use the “import card” as a bargaining chip to buy onions from farmers at a price that can hurt farmers. (READ: As onion prices fall ahead of imports, farmers’ livelihoods, lives at risk) “This will further depress prices for farmers, allow traders to take advantage and buy low from farmers, and give them the opportunity to hit the jackpot again during the offseason later this year when prices go up,” Raul Montemayor, Federation of Free Farmers Cooperatives Incorporated (FFFCI) national manager, told Rappler on January 11. “The government is playing into the hands of the traders.” A whole-of-government approach, led by the Bureau of Customs (BOC), should also be used in stopping smugglers, according to the former DA secretary. He clarified that the DA and Bureau of Plant Industry had no police power to go directly after smugglers, although it had visitorial powers over certain government facilities. “The Bureau of Plant Industry has visitorial power too because they issue import clearances and they have a good listing of cold storages in regard to imports of plant products. They have to elevate their game in looking at and visiting with police, with BOC, and others continuously. And BOC to really take leadership in bringing them to court,” Dar said. Dar emphasized that the government must already have identified who the smugglers are by now. It was only a matter of holding them accountable. “There are smugglers. I think with the economic intelligence you should know by now. With all the onions being brought from last year to now, you should have an idea who are bringing them via smuggling. Dapat lahat ng ito ay kasama sa imbestigasyon (All of this should be included in the investigation),” he said. Senators had also chided BOC officials in a committee hearing on Monday, January 16 for failing to convict any big-time smugglers in the six years since the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act had taken effect – even if the same names had been floating around for some time already. “‘Yung mga matatagal na kumilos na nagsmusmuggle ng mga bagay na ‘yan ay maikulong na sana kasi hindi pa rin po natututo. At tama ‘yung sinabi ni Senator Tulfo, baka naman kabarkada ng mga DA ang mga ‘yan,” Senator Grace Poe said during the hearing. (Those smugglers should be thrown in jail, since they never learn. And what Senator Tulfo said was right, maybe they’re all cozy with the DA.) Dar also said that with the proper agricultural strategies, the country could be 100% self-sufficient when it came to onion production. In fact, we’re already on that path. “We made inroads by way of enhancing productivity of the onion commodity and towards increasing local onion production. So nasa level na ng 90%. So meron pa rin tayong kakulangan ng 10% (So we’re already at the 90% level. We still have a 10% gap),” the former DA secretary said. “This 10% is very small. It’s possible. As I’ve said, properly done and sustained, we can be locally food self-sufficient.” First and foremost, Dar said the DA should enhance the productivity of local farmers by increasing hectarage devoted to onion production, or by boosting productivity per unit area by using better technologies or onion variants. This should be the “number 1 priority of the Department of Agriculture” in partnership with its bureaus and local government units, Dar emphasized. Next, the DA should also conduct anticipatory supply and demand analysis, allowing them to foresee possible shortages. The Department could then recommend to import the deficiency. In the short term, he said that smuggled onions deemed fit for human consumption should be sold at the markets to stabilize prices. “Kaladkarin lahat ‘yung na-ismuggled (Seize everything that’s been smuggled). Bring it to the market. … There is a way to do that.  You have to analyze whether that product can still be utilized for human beings. Meron naman (There is) laboratory analysis,” he said. In the long term, Dar said that the government should look to equip farmers with cold storage facilities, which would allow them store their own harvests and negotiate better prices with traders. “Sana itong taon na ito ay madagdagan significantly yung investment na doon sa cold storages na ‘yan. Nueva Ejica, Pangasinan, Mindoro, lahat (Hopefully this year, investment in cold storage is significantly increased. Nueva Ejica, Pangasinan, Mindoro, all of them). These are the key producing provinces,” the former DA secretary said. “That will give them the leverage to now discuss with traders. Presently, kung wala silang cold storages, ay talagang binabarat ng mga traders (Presently, if they don’t have cold storages, traders will lowball them).” As the Department of Agriculture grappled with soaring onion and egg prices – along with shortages in salt and sugar – Dar suggested looking for a full-time agriculture secretary. “The job of the agriculture secretary is a 24/7 responsibility. You can take it from there,” he said. “Suggestion lang. Hindi naman tayo decision-maker (This is just a suggestion. We’re not decision-makers here). It is now time, really, to have a full-time secretary.” – Rappler.com"

But despite possible but likely mild recessions in Europe and the United States, China’s expected reopening is set to fuel rebounds in nearby Asian economies and see it take the lead from India as the world’s leader in oil demand growth. “The preeminent driver of 2023 GDP (gross domestic product) and oil demand growth will be the timing and pace of China’s post-lockdown recovery,” the IEA said. Meanwhile, the main growth in oil supply is set to come from the United States as output from the OPEC+ producer group will decline by 870,000 bpd, led by Russia. Russian oil output was dented by only 200,000 bpd in December after the European Union banned imports of its seaborne crude and a coalition of countries imposed a price cap on its crude, the IEA said. That was around double what the IEA had predicted in its last report and the agency originally foresaw 3 million bpd being shut in after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s oil exports increased by just under 5% last year, the IEA said on Wednesday, though prices were far lower. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/samar-npa-leaders-surrender-army-vows-support-ex-rebels-january-2023/,[],"CATBALOGAN, Philippines – Armed Forces officials on Samar island stressed the need for funding the reintegration of former communist rebels as they presented 13 alleged surrenderers described as New People’s Army (NPA) “leaders” on Tuesday, January 17. The group was led by Dino Bachica alias Linoy, identified as the former chief of the NPA Sentro De Grabidad, Bugsok Platoon, a unit supervised by sub regional committee (SRC) Sesame of the Eastern Visayas regional committee (EVRPC). The 13 surrenderers reportedly turned over 10 M16 rifles, 2 cal. 45, and 1  Glock 17 pistol, anti-personnel mines, medical paraphernalia, and ammunition to the 801st Brigade Philippine Army, based in Brgy Fatima, Hinabangan, Samar on January 12. Brigade commander, Brigadier General Lenard Lelina, told Rappler that the Bugsok Platoon operates in the tri-boundaries of Pinabacdao, Calbiga, and Basey towns, all in Samar province. The Army brigade operates in the second district of Samar and part of Eastern Samar. Lelina said that the brigade in 2022 received 77 rebel  surrenderers, 102 members of the local militia (part-time guerrillas),  and 929 mass supporters who withdrew membership in or support to the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), which supersedes the armed wing. Ten rebels were killed and three other regular NPA fighters captured in the area, Lelina added. The general claimed the “disintegration of the leaders and members of the Eastern Visayas Regional Party Committee,” crediting this to successful efforts in nurturing peace builders – a term the AFP also uses for surrenderers. The bulk of surrenderers, he said, came from Calbiga, Pinabacdao, and Villareal towns. The CPP-NPA has suffered a series of setbacks on Samar island, culminating in the August 2022 explosion of a boat believed to be carrying top national officials of the insurgency. Lelina in an interview with Rappler said the AFP intends to sustain its gains by organizing surrenderers into Peacebuilder Groups, ensuring constant engagement, and working so they get benefits from different peace and development programs for livelihood and integration into the community. Lelina said funds from the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) are crucial to sustaining the peace. “It helps address the issues in the barangay. When we win the hearts of the community, that’s reduction of mass support to the NPAs,” he said. “A female former rebel told us yesterday that the primary reason why she surrendered is due to a steep decline in the number of their mass supporters,” the 801st brigade chief added in a mix of Filipino and English.. NTF-ELCAC are “development funds” used to reward barangays that cooperate with the AFP to clear their communities of communist presence. “We have reaped what we have sown. Our anti-insurgency campaign together with our ELCAC programs have proven to be fruitful,’ said Samar Governor Sharee Ann Tan during the presentation. She described the surrenderers as “witnesses to how the whole-of-nation approach has been effective, and how the government is sincere with its efforts to reintegrate them to the community, and liberate them from the false promises”  of communist rebels. The task force was formed on December 4, 2018 by then president Rodrigo Duterte as the bulwark of the government’s “whole-of-nation” approach in defeating Asia’s longest communist rebellion. After scuttling peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) in 2017, Duterte gave NTF-ELCAC the mandate to tap the entire bureaucracy, and government networks and resources to crush the 50-year-old communist rebellion. The NFT-ELCAC’s record has been spotty, however. Former officials of NTF-ELCAC hogged headlines with their verbal attacks not just against the CPP-NPA but even the political opposition and media, including Rappler. But critics, including senators, have slammed its stewardship of the funds and questioned its lack of efficiency in project implementation. The NTF-ELCAC’s Barangay Development Program had a P16.4 billion budget in 2021, but only 26 out 2,318 projects were completed by the time the 2022 budget hearings got underway. That finding prompted senators to slash its budget by P24 billion, but they eventually compromised, with Congress’s bicameral committee giving the NTF-ELCAC P17 billion for 2022. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s point men in the House of Representatives pushed for the restoration of the NTF-ELCAC’s budget in November 2022, they admitted that “only two percent of NTF-ELCAC’s 2022 projects has been completed or ongoing.” While there is no doubt that the country’s long-running insurgency is based on persistent problems of poverty and injustice, what is not clear is, if the NTF-ELCAC recipe addresses the roots of conflict.

https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-rate-united-kingdom-december-2022/,[],"LONDON, United Kingdom – British inflation eased last month after hitting a 41-year high in October, offering some comfort to the Bank of England (BoE), but the pressure on households remained intense as food and drink prices rose at the fastest pace since 1977. Annual consumer price inflation (CPI) fell to 10.5% in December from November’s 10.7%, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday, January 18, a drop in line with economists’ forecasts in a Reuters poll. However, while lower prices for gasoline and clothing pushed down the headline rate, the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages was 16.8% higher than a year earlier, the sharpest increase since September 1977, led by eggs, milk, and cheese. The BoE forecast in November that headline CPI would drop from a peak of 11.1% last October to around 5% by the end of 2023 as energy prices stabilize. But policymakers have warned of continued upward pressure on inflation from a tight jobs market and other factors, and financial markets expect the central bank to raise its main interest rate to 4% on February 2 from 3.5%. “The lower overall [CPI] rate…may reduce the risk of a wage-price spiral, but these figures suggest the BoE’s job is not yet done,” HSBC senior economist Liz Martins said. Sterling strengthened against the US dollar after the data. British inflation in December was higher than the 6.5% annual rate recorded for the United States and the 9.6% in Germany. While natural gas prices are below where they were a year ago, just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they are still several times higher than they were in mid-2021 and the impact of the increase continues to feed through the economy. Core CPI – which excludes energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, and which some economists view as a better guide to underlying inflation trends – was unchanged at 6.3% in December, in contrast to economists’ forecast for a drop to 6.2%. Inflation in services prices – which some BoE officials view as signaling more persistent inflation pressures and the secondary impact of higher energy and wage costs – rose to the highest since March 1992 at 6.8%. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt said after the figures were released that high inflation was a “nightmare for family budgets,” hurt business investment, and led to strike action. “However tough, we need to stick to our plan to bring it down,” he said. Hunt has resisted pay demands from public-sector trade unions, many of whom are taking strike action as their members’ wages are rising much more slowly than inflation and by less than the average in the private sector. Retail price inflation, used as a benchmark in some pay talks, was 13.4% in December, down from November’s 14%. Britain’s economy is set to contract this year as inflation squeezes disposable incomes, and the BoE forecasts unemployment will rise, factors which some BoE policymakers have said mean little or no more tightening is likely to be needed. Other members of the Monetary Policy Committee think it could be a tougher job to steer inflation back to 2% as wages are rising at their fastest rate in over 20 years. “This week’s evidence would suggest that bold action is required,” said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, who expects the BoE to raise rates to at least 4.5% before stopping. – Rappler.com"

Kingad will look to derail the red-hot Eko Roni Saputra when they tangle in a crucial flyweight MMA bout at Lumpinee Stadium in Bangkok, Thailand, on February 25, and he’ll be extra-motivated to do so, especially after his December return was postponed. The third-ranked contender was initially scheduled for a Manila comeback against Gurdashan Mangat at ONE 164, but the Indian-Canadian had to pull out, forcing “The King” to further wait for his return to the ONE Championship Circle. Now he’s eager for an impressive comeback, especially since he hasn’t stopped preparing – even after the cancellation of his previous bout. “My training pretty much continued even after Mangat dropped out. I never stopped and I stayed in shape, so training and preparation is not an issue for me,” Kingad said. Kingad won’t be facing a pushover against the Indonesian wrestling machine, but he believes that aside from Saputra’s wrestling, nothing will really threaten him. “Eko Roni Saputra has been impressive. He’s on a seven-fight winning streak. What I see from him, though, is that he always favors his ground game and wrestling. That’s where he’s at his best, and that’s what I’ve observed from his previous fights,” he said. “I’ve watched his every fight, and it’s the ground game that I have to worry about. Sure he had a knockout win, but his opponent wasn’t a good striker.“ The Team Lakay dynamo knows that this match will be crucial for his goals moving forward, especially since he’s eyeing to be back on top by the end of the year. Reeling off a shutout decision loss to Kairat Akhmetov, the 27-year-old knows that if he wants to get a shot at the ONE Flyweight World Title, it all starts by beating Saputra. “My goal for 2023 is to get a good winning streak going,” he said. “I’m coming off a loss, so I have to get back on the winning track, start a winning streak, and then become a World Champion before the year ends. That’s my goal this 2023.” – Rappler.com Read more from ONE Championship:"
https://www.rappler.com/business/bank-of-japan-monetary-policy-gdp-inflation-forecasts-january-2023/,[],"TOKYO, Japan – The Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Wednesday, January 18, maintained ultra-low interest rates, including a bond yield cap it was struggling to defend, defying market expectations it would phase out its massive stimulus program amid mounting inflationary pressure. The surprise decision sent the yen skidding against other currencies and bond yields tumbling the most in decades, as investors unwound bets they made anticipating the central bank would overhaul its yield control policy. Instead of changing its stimulus program, the BOJ crafted a new weapon to prevent long-term rates from rising too much – a move some analysts took as a sign Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold off making big policy shifts during the remaining months of his term, which ends in April. “This step will allow us to push down longer-term interest rates, without directly affecting supply and demand of the cash Japanese government bond (JGB) market,” Kuroda told a news conference. “We’d like to use this tool for various maturities, and in various ways.” Following its two-day policy meeting, the BOJ kept intact its yield curve control (YCC) targets, set at -0.1% for short-term interest rates and around 0% for the 10-year yield, by a unanimous vote. The central bank also made no change to its guidance that allows the 10-year bond yield to move 50 basis points either side of its 0% target. “Uncertainty regarding Japan’s economy is very high. It’s necessary to support the economy with our stimulus policy, to ensure companies can raise wages,” Kuroda said. The BOJ’s decision to beef up its key market operation tool is expected to help curb rises in long-term interest rates but importantly underscores its dogged commitment to defend the cap. “Widening the yield band or dismantling YCC now would have made the BOJ even more vulnerable to market attack,” said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research. “By showing its resolve to use market tools more flexibly, the BOJ wanted to signal to markets it won’t make big monetary policy changes under Kuroda.” Kuroda’s last policy meeting will be held on March 9 to 10, ending a decade helming the bank that brought about radical monetary stimulus but ultimately failed to meet its objective of sustainably reviving anemic consumer demand. The BOJ’s decision on Wednesday follows its surprise move last month to double the yield band, a tweak analysts say has failed to correct market distortions caused by its heavy bond buying. The dollar briefly rose 2.4% to 131.20 yen on the BOJ’s announcement, marking its biggest one-day jump since March 2020, while the Nikkei stock average jumped 2.5% to 26,791.12, its highest close since December 19. JGB yields tumbled across the curve with the benchmark 10-year yield sliding to 0.37%, well below the BOJ’s 0.5% ceiling and posting the biggest one-day decline since November 2003 at one point. Since December’s action, the BOJ has faced the biggest test to its YCC policy since its introduction in 2016 as rising inflation and the prospects of higher wages gave traders an excuse to attack the central bank’s yield cap with aggressive bond selling. While the BOJ has decided to stand pat for now, some lawmakers who once supported aggressive monetary easing now see an end to YCC as inevitable. Speaking in Davos after the BOJ’s decision, Trade Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, for one, said Japan was nearing the phase where easy policy could be stopped as wages rise. Market attention is already shifting toward monetary policy under Kuroda’s successor, who will need to steer an orderly exit from decades of ultra-low rates. “Whatever message the current BOJ leadership sends out, market expectations of a future tweak to YCC will continue,” said Toru Suehiro, chief economist at Daiwa Securities. In a quarterly report released on Wednesday, the BOJ raised its core consumer inflation forecast for the current fiscal year ending March to 3%, from 2.9% projected in October. It also revised up the inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 1.8% from 1.6% previously. However, it held its inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2024 at 1.6%, a sign the board is sticking to the view prices will moderate as the effect of past surges in raw material costs dissipates. The BOJ also slashed its economic growth projections for the next two fiscal years, amid worries slowing global demand will weigh on the export-reliant economy. Kuroda, however, said the BOJ projected wages to rise at “quite a fast pace,” as corporate profits are at record highs, the job market is tightening, and the economy was seen expanding above potential for three straight years. Japan’s core consumer inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s 2% target for eight straight months, as companies raised prices to pass on higher raw material costs to households. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/cagayan-de-oro-journalists-statements-acquittal-tax-cases-january-2023/,[],"CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Journalists in Cagayan de Oro hailed the latest legal victory of embattled online news organization Rappler and CEO Maria Ressa, saying the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) provided a “beacon of hope” for other news organizations across the country. The journalists said the charges were not really about tax issues but more of political undertones aimed at repressing the news organization critical of the Duterte administration. Earlier on Wednesday, January 18, the appellate court acquitted Rappler and its CEO, Nobel laureate Ressa, of tax evasion charges filed in 2018 by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Dr. Manuel Jaudian, former president of the Cagayan de Oro Press Club (COPC) and the chair of the COPC’s Institute of Journalism, said: “The ruling is another victory for the press. It’s also a caveat for any sitting power or despot that they cannot use just about any front to silence the media.” Jaudian and other journalists in Cagayan de Oro also expressed their support for the decision, saying it was a triumph of truth and a positive step for press freedom and democracy in the country. They said the acquittal served as a reminder that the media should be able to operate without fear of repression or censorship, and served as a “beacon of hope.” Cagayan de Oro-based Ryan Rosauro, former national chairman of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), called the decision a “triumph of the truth which is becoming a scarce commodity in public life.” “Hopefully, this will also give an important shot in the arm for press freedom and democracy in the country,” Rosauro said. Mindanao Today associate editor Jigger Jerusalem said the CTA decision gave other media outfits and journalists in the country hope that things would get better for journalism in the country and encouraged them to continue to report the truth to the public. (Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story referred to Jigger Jerusalem as the editor-in-chief of Mindanao Today. This has been corrected.) “The best thing for media practitioners to do is to hold their ground and do what they know best – report the truth to the public,” Jerusalem said. Dr. Nef Luczon, a director of the COPC, said the decision would likely open up a more frank and open discourse on the role of an independent press in society and the main duty of private news media organizations to be objective watchdogs. “It will ignite more discussions on media management and how it is associated with private media’s role in scrutinizing affairs that are of public interest. The business side of running media companies – which includes issues on taxes – is another layer of operation, which should not control nor influence editorial or journalistic credibility,” he said. Luczon said the main duty of private news media organizations is to be objective watchdogs. He said the tax evasion cases also served as a reminder for media companies to follow laws, pay taxes correctly, and secure their business papers. The decision has been hailed as a significant victory for Rappler and Ressa who faced several legal challenges in recent years because of critical reporting. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/europeans-dial-down-heating-heed-calls-save-energy-winter-2022-2023/,[],"BERLIN, Germany – Europeans have dialed down their heating this winter, apparently heeding government calls to conserve energy amid the Ukraine crisis, with some delaying switching it on by almost a month and setting the temperature lower, data shows. The data, from hundreds of thousands of smart thermometers installed in households across the continent by Munich-based company Tado, shows that as temperatures dropped, households responded to dire warnings about higher heating costs. People and businesses across Europe are increasing their use of such smart thermometers to keep an eye on how much gas they are using. These are sometimes linked to an energy provider’s tariff structure to smooth demand and reduce peak costs. Germany has made them obligatory in newbuilds. In the winter of 2022-2023, the proportion of homes with heating switched on across Europe passed 90% on November 28. In the previous three years, that threshold was passed weeks earlier, on November 7, 12, and 5 respectively, according to data from Tado, which is one of many companies active in the fast-growing smart thermometer market. German public authorities reduced temperatures in their offices to a chilly 19°C. At the university in Frankfurt an der Oder on the Polish border, staff were issued with blankets to wrap themselves in. Tado’s data shows how households also cut back. Home heating settings averaged almost a degree lower this winter than in previous years, based on the data. After a hectic time, energy regulators are more relaxed about Europe’s gas supply prospects. “With savings, gas inflows, good storage levels, we are very, very optimistic that we will no longer have to worry about a gas shortage this winter,” German network regulator Klaus Mueller said on Tuesday, January 17, after previously having told consumers to make deep cuts to prevent serious disruption. The European Union imports 80% of its gas and gas represents 22% of Europe’s energy consumption and meets 32% of households’ energy needs, according to the EU. But there have been huge efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas and increase imports from European gas producers like Norway and the Netherlands, while Germany has quickly built liquefied natural gas terminals. Gas prices in Europe have fallen sharply from a peak in August, as a rush to fill storage pushed the market higher. Tado’s data, based on readings from 340,000 cloud-linked smart thermometers around Europe, is relatively resistant to varied weather conditions over the four winters it measured, since it records the target temperatures households set. These show regional variations but also a clear direction. Dutch households reduced target temperatures by 0.99°C on average compared with a year ago, while Spanish consumers cut targets by 0.29°C. In Britain, 79.6% of Tado-linked homes lowered their temperature settings, while in gas-rich Norway only 47% did. Temperature settings in Norway dropped by 0.2°C to 20.8°C and in Britain by 1 degree to 18.3°C. European governments, including Germany, have provided billions of euros to help people and businesses cope with the high energy bills. Tado has 3 million thermometers installed, but comparisons can only be made between thermostats that have been installed in the same place for four years running. As a result, only about 10% of them can be used in the data. There is also a “wealth effect.” In Western Europe, the demographic where the thermometers are installed is quite broad. The data is less representative in countries in eastern Europe, where households with smart thermostats tend to be the more wealthy ones. In Bulgaria, Tado’s customers lowered their temperatures by 0.28% on average. “Some 79% of energy consumption in a private home is heating and hot water,” said Tado’s managing director Christian Deilmann. “The TV, cooking, and lighting aren’t so important: the important thing is to have the heating and hot water under control.” German regulators are worried that the current lower gas prices will make customers worry less about conserving energy. It is still too early to tell from Tado’s data whether households’ energy discipline is slackening. “We have to start thinking about 2023/24,” tweeted Mueller, the German regulator, on Tuesday. “We have to keep saving gas, being more energy efficient, build out renewables, and fill storage.” – Rappler.com"

Ressa emphasized that Rappler’s tax cases “are where capital markets, where rule of law, where press freedom meet.” The Court of Tax Appeals 1st division acquitted Ressa and RHC, Rappler’s holding company, where the Duterte government alleged that it evaded tax payments when it raised capital through Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs). The PDRs were issued to North Base Media (NBM) and Omidyar Network (ON). PDRs are financial instruments that allow foreign entities to invest in industries like media without violating the Constitution’s restrictions. In the case of media companies, the Constitution specifies that it should be 100% Filipino-owned. PDR holders are entitled to dividends, but have no voting rights. A PDR derives its value from shares, but does not make the holder become shareholders of the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Rappler of evading tax payments when it raised capital through PDRs. It also alleged that Rappler was a dealer of securities. The CTA voted 3-0, ruling that Rappler was not required to pay income tax for the PDR transactions, as the said financial instrument was for capital raising purposes and not a share sale, where the latter is taxable for income. “With due respect to the prosecution, their theory of the case fails to distinguish between investments and sale of stock in trade,” Lim said. Lim explained that had the CTA ruled against Ressa and Rappler, it would have sent a signal to investors that capital raising activities and maiden offerings are taxable in the Philippines. “If you make that taxable, companies may be limited to internally generated funds, which by nature is quite limiting,” Lim said. The CTA also noted that “there is nothing in the wordings of the PDR instruments and the PDR subscription agreements that would show the foreign entities NBM and ON will become owners of the shares of stock of Rappler.” Eric Recalde, Rappler legal counsel, emphasized that mere capital raising does not make one a dealer of securities. “Rappler undertook this capital raising activity for expansion to have a vibrant press. This also teaches us that taxation can never be used by the government to muzzle press freedom,” Recalde said. –Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao-lawyers-statements-maria-ressa-tax-evasion-acquittal-january-2023/,[],"CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Lawyers based in Mindanao hailed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to acquit Rappler chief executive officer Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC) of tax evasion charges filed in 2018, saying that the verdict upheld press freedom and restored confidence in companies that issue Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) to raise investments. They said the decision on Wednesday, January 18, is also seen as having a positive impact on the investment climate, with companies and investors now feeling more confident about issuing PDRs and raising capital. The cases had caused some uncertainty and nervousness in the business community, and the acquittal is seen as “a sign that the legal system is fair and impartial,” said former Cagayan de Oro City mayor and banker-lawyer Oscar Moreno. Moreno, who once served as vice president and chief legal counsel of BPI Capital Corporation and an associate director of Ayala Corporation’s strategic planning group, said the cases had been “counterproductive” and hurt the economy. “The cases were transcendental and could have reversed the economic boom that started in the 1990s. Suddenly, corporations and investors became edgy and started having second thoughts about PDRs. As a result, many held back. I can just imagine how corporate executives and investors watched this closely until the CTA reached its decision,” Moreno said. He said the issuance of PDRs has always been a universally accepted practice and not unique to Rappler. “From the start, what Rappler did was aboveboard and not violative of any law. It has been the practice. Unfortunately, this case was used against the critical press, and as a result, it affected the country’s investment climate and the economy,” Moreno said. PDRs, he explained by using an analogy, merely entitle investors to “fruits but not dispose of the tree – they can do whatever they wish with the fruits but they don’t own the tree.” A former dean of the College of Law of San Sebastian College, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, also lauded the acquittal of Ressa and Rappler, saying the tax evasion cases “should not have been filed in the first place.” Rodriguez said, “These cases were mere harassment against Ressa for her and Rappler’s objective, fair, and fearless criticism of some actions of the Duterte administration.” The tax evasion cases and their outcome showed the importance of the three branches of government operating independently from each other, said Jose Edgardo Uy, another Mindanao-based lawyer. Uy, a former vice president of the Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company, criticized the actions of the government against Ressa and Rappler during the Duterte administration as a mockery of the country’s justice system with the investment climate as collateral damage. “The wheels of justice must not turn in favor of the connected and influential,” Uy said. Davao lawyer and former Bayan Muna representative Carlos Isagani Zarate said he has yet to see how the CTA tackled the issue on the issuance of PDRs in its ruling, but added that the acquittal was a welcome one and showed how facts trumped political motivations in this case. Zarate also called for the dismissal of other cases faced by Ressa and Rappler, and other journalists facing similar “trumped-up charges” such as Frenchie Mae Cumpio of Tacloban City. Cumpio has been in detention since 2020 after she was linked by the military to the New People’s Army. “We truly laud members of the judiciary for exercising genuine independence, especially in a climate of impunity,” Zarate said. After more than four years, the 1st Division of the CTA decided to acquit Ressa and Rappler’s holding company of tax evasion. The Duterte administration, through the Bureau of Internal Revenue, had alleged that Ressa and Rappler evaded tax payments when they raised capital through PDRs issued to foreign investors North Base Media and Omidyar Network. Rappler still faces three other court cases: the appeal of Ressa and former researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. in their conviction for cyber libel pending at the Supreme Court, a tax case at the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, and the appeal on the closure of Rappler pending at the Court of Appeals. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/albay-town-mayor-officials-lose-appeal-sandiganbayan-fertilizer-graft-case/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has denied the motion for reconsideration of former Manito, Albay mayor Carmencita Daep and town officials who were found guilty of graft for procuring P3 million worth of unregistered fertilizers in 2004. In a 46-page resolution, the Sandiganbayan’s 4th Division said there was no additional information in the appeals that would warrant a reversal of its ruling. Other co-defendants in the case are municipal accountant Ameife Lacbain, Bids an Awards Committee (chairman Dioscoro Ardales, and BAC members Arnold Calsiña, and Ernesto Millena. The five were found guilty on October 21, 2022. They face six to 10 years imprisonment with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Daep, a former nun and college teacher, said in her appeal that she merely relied on the recommendations of her subordinates, in particular, the town’s BAC. She said she only approved the contract award to the fertilizer supplier, Hexaphil Agriventures Incorporated, after the BAC members already signed the resolution. The funding came from the P780 million Farm Inputs/Farm Implements Program (FIFIP) of the Department of Agriculture. Daep also said she was unfamiliar with Republic Act 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, which was still new when the transaction was done. Then-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed RA 9184 in January 2003. In support of her appeal, Daep also submitted an affidavit saying she was a former nun. She said she entered a convent ran by the Benedictine Order before she met her husband, and that she decided to leave to get married. She also told the court that she finished her term as municipal mayor without any record of corruption or any form of malfeasance. “Contrary to Daep’s submissions, such additional information is insufficient to reverse the Court’s earlier findings. Such minor corroborative additions do not materially change the substance of her previous testimony or the evidence already presented for the defense,” the Sandiganbayan said. The court noted that the documents related to the procurement contained “red flags,” and that her actions in approving the transaction was “grossly and inexcusably negligent.” The Office of the Ombudsman had accused the municipal officials of conspiracy in the purchase of P2.9 million worth of unregistered liquid fertilizer at P700 per bottle from Hexaphil through negotiated procurement even if the firm had no legal standing. During the trial, evidence presented showed that Hexaphil does not exist in the records of the Makati Business Permit and Licensing Office where it was supposed to have been registered as a business establishment. The head of the Fertilizer Regulatory Services Division of the Fertilizer and Pesticides Authority also revealed that the supposed license produced by Hexaphil was fake since the FPA number written on it belonged to another company. In addition, the supposed signatory on the document had already retired. Hexaphil was also not registered with the Department of Trade and Industry, had a revoked Securities and Exchange Commission registration, and no record of tax payments. Prosecutors said it also submitted a spurious license to operate that was disowned by the Calauan Business Office in Laguna. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/foreign-buying-china-stocks-january-17-2023/,[],"SHANGHAI, China – In less than three weeks of 2023, foreign buying of Chinese stocks has exceeded last year’s total as investors bet on the country’s rapid recovery after COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted. Overseas funds snapped up big-cap blue-chips from consumer staples to financial firms at record pace for fear of missing out on gains and lagging behind their peers. They purchased a net 91.2 billion yuan ($13.45 billion) of China stocks via the Stock Connect scheme so far in 2023, compared with a total 90 billion they bought in 2022. The amount invested during the 11-day buying streak was also the biggest monthly inflow on record. The inflows follow China’s relaxation of its zero-COVID strategy in December, a policy that sapped consumption and production. Until January 17 this year, foreign investors had bought a net 7.2 billion yuan ($1.06 billion) of battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Ltd – the stock that drew the largest net inflow, according to Reuters caculations of exchange data. They also purchased a net 7.1 billion yuan of Ping An Insurance Group and a net 6.4 billion yuan of liquor producer Kweichow Moutai Company, respectively. “Buying those index heavyweights shows foreign investors’ confidence in China’s economic recovery this year,” said Daisy Li, fund manager at EFG Asset Management. Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities, said foreign funds tend to invest in large-cap Chinese companies, which are relatively stable and attractively valued. The fast appreciation in China’s currency has also lured foreign money into China assets, EFG’s Li added. China’s yuan had gained roughly 2% against the greenback so far this year. The CSI 300 benchmark is up roughly 7% so far in 2023, and 18% higher than at end-October, a recent trough. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng benchmark has soared nearly 50% since October. “Some foreign investors are playing catch-up by snapping up China A-shares, which lag Hong Kong’s strong rally,” said Xia Chun, chief economist at wealth manager Yintech Investment Holdings. International banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have upgraded their China growth forecast to at least 5.5% in 2023, expecting a robust post-pandemic recovery. “Foreign inflows have become the main incremental fund for China’s stock market since November, playing an important role shaping A-share performance and style,” said analysts at Industrial Securities, who expect around 300 billion yuan of net inflows in 2023. – Rappler.com $1 = 6.7795 Chinese yuan renminbi"

Chua parted ways with NLEX as he got shipped to the Fuel Masters together with Paul Varilla and a second-round pick in the next draft in exchange for Anthony and Jake Pascual.

https://www.rappler.com/business/gross-domestic-product-taiwan-q4-2022/,[],"TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwan’s trade-dependent economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, putting in its worst performance in 13 years, hit by a drop in exports on slowing global tech demand and COVID-related chaos in its largest market China. For the October-December period, annual gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.86% from the same period a year earlier, compared with 4.01% growth for the previous quarter, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Wednesday, January 18. That was worse than an increase of 1.3% forecast in a Reuters poll, and the worst quarterly performance since the economy contracted 1.13% in the third quarter of 2009, when the world was dealing with a financial crisis. Compared with the previous quarter, Taiwan’s economy contracted 4.24% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. “External demand has weakened significantly,” the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics said, pointing to global inflation and interest rate rises suppressing demand and “the deterioration of the pandemic in mainland China interfering with consumption and production activities.” For all of 2022, the economy expanded a preliminary 2.43%, compared to 6.53% logged for 2021. That was slightly slower than last year’s 3% growth recorded in China, which was hit hard by stringent COVID curbs and a property market slump. Taiwan’s total fourth-quarter exports dropped 8.63% from a year earlier in US dollar terms, the agency said. As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple, Taiwan’s economy had outperformed many regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for tech exports as more people turned to working and studying from home. But global economic woes driven by soaring inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine, as well as China’s pandemic situation, has impacted demand for made-in-Taiwan goods. Taiwan will release revised GDP figures at a later date, yet to be set, including full-year growth forecasts for 2023.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/new-school/opinion-being-blind-student-film-school/,[],"In December of 2013, I was diagnosed with bilateral optic neuropathy (i.e., permanent damage on the optic nerves of both eyes). While the condition does not entail total loss of vision, it causes me to be highly dependent on low vision devices and accessibility features such as magnification and text-to-speech. The cause remains to be unknown, so it has also been difficult for even the best doctors to find a cure. I was just 10 years old back then. In the start, it was unclear why eye glasses were not enough considering it was our first time hearing of such a condition. Ophthalmologists initially suggested that it could be glaucoma or a brain tumor. 10-year-old me had no clue what either of these possible conditions were. I remember heading straight to an eye clinic after class in the fifth grade and having this exchange with the head doctor: Me: “Am I gonna die?” Them: “We don’t know yet.” Me: “Oh. Okay.” Luckily, it was neither glaucoma nor a brain tumor, but it was the start of me being terrified of what the future entailed for me. I used to be on the honors roll in school but quickly started failing classes in middle school and high school. Everyone around me knew that it was because of the sudden loss in vision, but part of me knew that it was also because of the loss of motivation. We experimented with several low vision gadgets that would help me cope with the mainstream curriculum (having chosen not to attend a school for the blind) until a low vision specialist told me that the best gadget to aid me was an iPad. Yes, an iPad. I spent the rest of middle school and high school using its camera to zoom in to read and write. This was helpful in allowing me to participate in activities but just until the bare minimum, finishing reading comprehension quizzes in school but never actually finishing the assigned story. It was also quite depressing outside of school, having grown up loving drawing and playing tennis but eventually struggling to perform these activities with blurred vision and blind spots. Now being 19 years old and taking film studies in college, things are somehow turning out well for me in terms of academics and extracurriculars. I finally got back on the honors roll despite not having much improvement in vision. There were several factors to this, but perhaps the biggest ones were having a strong support system and a sudden boost in motivation. My family has always been incredibly supportive. This has always been the case. Perhaps the biggest change was the school. My college has been so inclusive to me, never treating me different from others, but still being accommodating whenever necessary. It is a wonderful middle ground between feeling safe enough to ask for help and not being separated from the rest of students. For the first time, I was no longer known as “the blind kid” in school. This inclusivity could be seen in almost everyone in the college, including but not limited to professors, students, guards, and of course, the office in charge of inclusive education. It felt unbelievable at first, formerly coming from a school that tried to convince me into transferring to an institution for the blind. There are still occasional challenges here and there. My first short film assignment for class required a bunch of reshoots for the funniest reason — I did not notice the Lysol spray bottle in the background. Not realizing small details became a recurring issue for a while. Nonetheless, the passion still remains there. I also decided to focus more on screenwriting, a skill in filmmaking that required less eyesight. I love being a screenwriter because it allows me to write about what I want to see and having a production team bring that sight to me — a sight that would have been difficult for me to experience and appreciate (in terms of visuals) outside of a movie set. People often ask me if filmmaking is a difficult course for me because of how dependent it is on visuals, which is a legitimate concern, but it eventually occurred to me that whatever course would have been difficult for me because of that reason. It was passion and support for that passion that drove me. It has almost been a decade since the low vision specialist told me to use an iPad camera to cope with daily life. Being so dependent on cameras back then makes becoming a film student feel like a full circle moment. Instead of being dependent on cameras, it is now cameras that empower me and allow me to bring stories to life. Of course, this is not the case for everyone. I understand that I come from a position of privilege for being part of communities that are capable of being so supportive and for not losing the entirety of my vision in general. I definitely could not have made it through without the family, friends, and institutions that have been so supportive. – Rappler.com Charlie Vitug is a film student at the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde.

The CTA’s 1st Division acquitted Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC), Rappler’s holding company, of four counts of tax evasion filed during the Duterte administration on Wednesday. In its 80-page decision, the CTA said the respondents did not commit the supposed violations, adding that the civil liability in the case cannot be awarded “since there is no act or omission punishable by law.” Rappler executives led by Ressa, went to the CTA in Quezon City for the trial, along with Rappler Executive Editor Glenda Gloria and Chief Finance Officer Fel Dalafu. Ressa recalled that she had a vivid memory of Dalafu bursting with joy as the decision was being read. “…in the court room and of course it was emotional for all of us.” Ressa and the Rappler executives were also joined by their legal counsels, lawyers Francis Lim, Eric Recalde, and Jacqui Tan. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate also dedicated Rappler’s first legal victory to all unjustly accused: “So this acquittal, kahit na medyo matagal po (even though it took time) is not just for Rappler, it is for every Filipino who has ever been unjustly accused.” Ressa reiterated that the cases against Rappler are politically motivated and prove there was an abuse of power. She added the harassment was also “meant to stop journalists from doing their jobs.” The court decision is proof that Rappler is not a tax evader, she said. “Siguro naman po, sa mga trolls ng Rappler at doon sa mga naniniwala sa mga kasinungalingan tungkol sa Rappler, napatunayan na po namin na hindi tax evader ang Rappler (Perhaps, to those who troll Rappler and those who believe the lies against Rappler, we have already proven that Rappler is not a tax evader).” Former senator Leila de Lima and journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, who were both detained under Duterte, were also mentioned by Ressa.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-australian-open-results-rafael-nadal-mackenzie-mcdonald-january-18-2023/,[],"MELBOURNE, Australia – Defending champion Rafa Nadal bowed out of the second round of the Australian Open on Wednesday, January 18, after suffering an injury during his 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 defeat againt American Mackenzie McDonald. Nadal’s elimination shakes up the men’s draw and puts a twist in the Grand Slam title race, with nine-time champion Novak Djokovic able to draw level with the Spaniard’s 22 major championships should he take a 10th crown at Melbourne Park. Nadal appeared to suffer a strain in his left hip area while running for a backhand deep in the second set at Rod Laver Arena and after receiving attention from a trainer he took an off-court medical time-out when trailing 6-4, 5-3. He returned grim faced to play out the match but his movement was clearly affected, particularly on his backhand side, paving the way for McDonald to end the Spaniard’s bid for a third title at Melbourne Park. “It has been like this a couple of days,” said Nadal of his injury. “I have a history of hip issues. “I’ve had to do treatments in the past but it was not this amount of a problem.” Before the injury McDonald had played superbly to take the first set, going toe-to-toe with the 36-year-old Spaniard and winning most of the ferocious baseline exchanges. “He’s an incredible champion, he’s never going to give up regardless of the situation so even closing it out against a top guy like that is always tough,” said McDonald. “I was trying to stay so focused on what I was doing and he kind of got me out of that with what he was doing. But I kind of just kept focusing on myself and got through.” “Last time I played him was at Chatrier, he kicked my butt,” said McDonald, who took only four games off Nadal in the second round of the French Open in 2020. “It’s tough to hit through on clay but I liked my chances on hard, I really wanted to take it to him on hard court. I’m really glad I got my chance and got away with it.” After Nadal’s time-out, he returned to court to a big ovation and earned another round of applause when he held serve. His gloomy expression told the story, though, and he declined to retrieve a drop-shot in the next game, shaking his head at his worried entourage. McKenzie took the second set when Nadal whacked a forehand into the net, and the Spaniard thudded his racket into his chair at the change of ends. Leaning heavily on serve and relying on touch, Nadal dragged McDonald deep into the third set but was finally broken to 6-5 when the American bolted forward to flick a passing shot past him. Nadal attacked the net in a desperate last stand but there was to be no repeat of the “Miracle of Melbourne”, when he came back from two sets down in last year’s classic final to beat Daniil Medvedev. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/important-step-for-press-freedom-countries-praise-rappler-tax-evasion-acquittal/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – Foreign governments across the world welcomed the Philippine Court of Tax Appeals’ (CTA) decision to acquit Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC) of tax evasion charges filed by the Duterte government in 2018, praising it as an “important step” in upholding the rule of law in the country. In a tweet on Wednesday, January 18, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell Fontelles said the regional bloc hoped that pending cases against Rappler and Ressa would also be resolved soon. “We trust that remaining charges will be resolved quickly. We continue to support journalists’ crucial work,” Fontelles said. A separate statement from the Media Freedom Coalition, co-chaired by Canada and the Netherlands, echoed this, saying the outcome “marks an important and positive step towards upholding the rule of law and media freedom.” “We…are encouraged that this decision will help guide future implementation and regulation that impacts media freedom to effectively safeguard and protect it,” they added. Rappler Holdings and Ressa’s acquittal was a rare legal victory for the embattled newsroom and journalist, who for years have been subject to a slew of legal attacks. The series of cases filed against Rappler and Ressa threatened to jail the Nobel laureate and strip the media outlet of its license to operate. With the tax evasion case filed in March 2018, the former Duterte government accused RHC and Ressa of evading tax payments when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors North Base Media (NBM) and Omidyar Network (ON). It argued that income tax and VAT should have been paid in the issuance of Philippine Depositary Receipts or PDRs to the two entities. PDRs are financial instruments commonly used among media companies to allow foreign investment without violating a constitutional rule that media companies should be 100% Filipino-owned. On Wednesday, the court ordered the acquittal, saying the prosecution had failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Rappler’s lawyers said that in the last 20 years, the BIR has treated PDRs as derivatives of stock for which only documentary stamp tax was due to be paid. In an 80-page decision, the CTA said, “No gain or income was realized by accused in the subject transactions.” The CTA also said, “There is nothing in the wordings of the PDR instruments and the PDR subscription agreements that would show the foreign entities NBM and ON will become owners of the shares of stock of Rappler.” On Twitter, German Ambassador Anke Reiffensteul hailed the acquittal as a “victory for journalists, press freedom, and the rule of law in the Philippines.” The Media Freedom Coalition is a network of 51 countries advocating for media freedom and the safety of journalists in their respective countries and abroad. The coalition said it uses a mix of diplomatic interventions, advocacy, support for legal reforms, international events, and providing funding for such initiatives to promote press freedom worldwide. Its members include Australia, the United States, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, and Ukraine, among others. Foreign governments watching the case closely took note of the court’s decision and said it was “encouraged” that the ruling would guide the future implementation of laws in the Philippines which impact media. “Any measure that undermines the independence and freedom of the press must be strictly scrutinized with the highest standard of law and human rights,” they said. After the junking of its tax evasion case, Rappler and Ressa now have three active court cases pending. This includes the appeal of Ressa and former researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. in their conviction for cyber libel pending at the Supreme Court, a lone tax case at the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, and the appeal on the closure of Rappler pending at the Court of Appeals. Ressa, facing the media after the CTA’s decision to acquit her, said: “Today, facts win, truth wins, justice wins.” – with reports by Lian Buan/Rappler.com"

In a tweet, former vice president Leni Robredo expressed hopes for more legal victories for the veteran journalist and the long-embattled newsroom. “Truth and light prevailed today,” Robredo wrote on Wednesday, January 18. Senator Risa Hontiveros shared a similar sentiment, adding that the crackdown on Rappler “only wastes government funds.” “I hope that the other charges against Maria Ressa and Rappler will soon be similarly dropped, as these were only intended to silence and intimidate members of the media from reporting on and speaking against the excesses of the previous administration, particularly on the bloody, abusive and failed war on drugs,” Hontiveros, deputy minority floor leader in the Senate, said. Former Quezon City 6th District Representative Kit Belmonte also bared his elation on social media after learning the news of Ressa’s acquittal. “Konti na lang (only a few more cases left)! Congratulations, Maria Ressa!” he wrote on Twitter. Personalities from the militant Makabayan bloc asserted that the legal challenge faced by Ressa and her newsroom were bogus in the first place. “We know that the case filed by the Duterte administration was a harassment suit, similar to the trumped-up charges filed against activists and members of the opposition,” House deputy minority leader France Castro of ACT Teachers said in a statement. “Let this serve as a reminder that dictatorships will never succeed. We must not let our guard down as fascists who are intolerant of dissent are again occupying key positions in the Marcos Jr. administration, itching to ram their kind of thinking on the populace,” former congressman Neri Colmenares, who still chairs Bayan Muna party, added. The tax appellate court, in its decision, said the prosecution failed to prove that Ressa and RHC were guilty beyond reasonable doubt of tax evasion when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors North Base Media (NBM) and Omidyar Network (ON). The charges were filed by the Duterte administration. Reacting to the CTA ruling, Ressa said: “Today, facts win, truth wins, justice wins.” There are still pending court cases against Ressa: the appeal of Ressa and former researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. in their conviction for cyber libel pending at the Supreme Court, the lone tax case at the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, and the appeal on the closure of Rappler pending at the Court of Appeals. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/ring-of-honor-wrestling-star-jay-briscoe-dies/,['DELFIN DIOQUINO'],"MANILA, Philippines – American wrestling star Jay Briscoe died on Tuesday, January 17 (Wednesday, January 18, Manila time) following a car accident just a week before his 39th birthday.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/families-urge-blinken-use-china-trip-free-detainees/,[],"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Katherine Swidan, whose son Mark has been imprisoned in China for over 10 years, has not seen even a photograph of him over the last decade. The last time she heard his voice was in 2018. She and the families of other Americans, who according to the US government are wrongfully held in China, are hoping that the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken can push the Chinese authorities for the release of their loved ones as he visits Beijing next month. “My message for Blinken is: say their names,” said Katherine Swidan in a phone interview from her home in Luling, Texas. “They’re American citizens. They’ve been wrongfully detained. Enough is enough.” Mark Swidan, a Texas-based businessman, was convicted by a Chinese court on drug-related charges despite a lack of evidence and in 2019 given a death sentence with reprieve. A United Nations working group has concluded he was arbitrarily detained in violation of international law. The Biden administration’s recent high-profile prisoner swaps, such as basketball star Brittney Griner’s release from Russia in exchange for a convicted Russian arms dealer, have spurred calls for Washington to do more for US citizens held in China, some of whom have languished for over a decade with little consular contact. But the detainee issue often gets lost within the wider complexity of the US-China relationship, which in recent years has sunk to its lowest point in decades. And, unlike Griner, the US citizens held in China are not well known to the American public. Families of detained Americans say the freedom of their relatives should not be bundled up with challenging policy issues and should instead be addressed in a separate track focused on humanitarian matters. “This cannot be treated as a long-term policy exercise,” said Harrison Li, the son of Chinese-American Kai Li who has been detained in China since 2016. “My dad, he is not a complex policy issue. It’s a very clear cut-and-dry issue of an innocent American citizen being used as a pawn by the Chinese government to extract something,” Li said. A Chinese court handed his father a 10-year jail sentence in 2018 for espionage. Kai Li denies the charges. There have been talks in recent months, Li said, between Washington and Beijing over the Americans detained in China but they did not go anywhere. “And that’s why it’s so important for Secretary Blinken to use his upcoming trip next month to keep this issue in the spotlight and keep the negotiations going.” Senior Biden administration officials, including Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink during a December visit to China, have told Chinese counterparts that securing the release of U.S. citizens who are wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in China is a personal priority for the U.S. president. While President Joe Biden raised the issue when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, he did not mention the specific names of the detained Americans, according to sources familiar with their talks. One person familiar with plans for Blinken’s trip to China said the top US diplomat does intend to raise the names of high-profile detainees, including Mark Swidan, Kai Li and David Lin – an American pastor detained in China since 2006 – as well as others during talks. The State Department declined to offer details of “ongoing diplomatic conversations” when asked about efforts to secure prisoner releases, but a department spokesperson told Reuters that Blinken “is personally focused on and prioritizes bringing home US nationals wrongfully detained” in China. The United States does not provide an official figure for how many citizens are detained abroad, but The Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for the release of political prisoners in China, estimates there are more than 200 Americans in China alone who are wrongfully detained or facing coercive measures, such as exit bans. John Kamm, the chairman of Dui Hua, believes that China could be ready to compromise on detainees for the sake of the overall relationship with the United States. Former U.S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit last year to Taiwan severely strained bilateral ties, but U.S. officials have said they believe China wants to stabilize relations as it faces domestic economic headwinds and spiking COVID-19 cases. “The area where China can make concessions to improve the relationship – which is what they say they want to do – is in the area prisoner releases,” Kamm said. “We have an opportunity. I hope that’s being pushed very, very hard.” – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/technology/getty-images-sues-stable-diffusion-creators-stability-ai/,['VICTOR BARREIRO JR.'],"MANILA, Philippines – Getty Images announced in a press statement on Tuesday, January 17, it was suing Stability AI, the makers of artificial intelligence-powered art tool Stable Diffusion, for infringing on its copyright by scraping images and processing them for use with Stable Diffusion. The Getty Images statement said it had “commenced legal proceedings in the High Court of Justice in London against Stability AI claiming Stability AI infringed intellectual property rights including copyright in content owned or represented by Getty Images.” Getty Images asserted that “Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright and the associated metadata owned or represented by Getty Images absent a license to benefit Stability AI’s commercial interests and to the detriment of the content creators.” The Verge, in its report, added that Getty’s CEO, Craig Peters, told them it had given Stability AI a “letter before action” – or a formal notification of impending litigation in the United Kingdom. It is unclear if the litigation will also be done in the United States. “We don’t believe this specific deployment of Stability’s commercial offering is covered by fair dealing in the UK or fair use in the US,” Peters said. “The company made no outreach to Getty Images to utilize our or our contributors’ material so we’re taking an action to protect our and our contributors’ intellectual property rights.” A representative for Stability AI, Angela Pontarolo, meanwhile told The Verge, “Stability AI team has not received information about this lawsuit, so we cannot comment.” The full details of Getty Images’ lawsuit aren’t public yet, but Peters said the charges include copyright violation and violation of the site’s terms of service, which in this case would mean web scraping. A 2022 analysis of the Stable Diffusion dataset by an independent party noticed images from Getty, as well from other stock image sites, made up some of the contents of the dataset. The analysis from August 2022 noted, “Unsurprisingly, a large number came from stock image sites. 123RF was the biggest with 497k, 171k images came from Adobe Stock’s CDN at ftcdn.net, 117k from PhotoShelter, 35k images from Dreamstime, 23k from iStockPhoto, 22k from Depositphotos, 22k from Unsplash, 15k from Getty Images, 10k from VectorStock, and 10k from Shutterstock, among many others.” Additionally, Getty Images’ presence is visible, as the AI software’s can sometimes recreate the Getty watermark when it makes new renderings. Getty Images appears to be looking towards creating a new legal ruling in terms of AI art tools and the licensing of images. Getty has said it “provided licenses to leading technology innovators for purposes related to training artificial intelligence systems in a manner that respects personal and intellectual property rights.” It added that Stability AI “did not seek any such license from Getty Images and instead, we believe, chose to ignore viable licensing options and long‑standing legal protections in pursuit of their stand‑alone commercial interests.” The Getty Images suit follows the filing of a class action lawsuit by a number of artists against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for creating “products that infringe the rights of artists and other creative individuals under the guise of alleged ‘artificial intelligence.'” – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/last-of-us-break-bad-video-game-adaptation-curse/,[],"Even if you’re not a video game player, you might have heard about the just released and highly anticipated television series based on beloved and acclaimed video game The Last of Us. However, to say video game adaptations are often awful is an understatement. It’s a long running joke just how terrible film and television series based on video games inevitably are. And yet, more adaptations of video games keep being churned out by studios. From 1993’s Super Mario Bros film which regularly features on lists of the worst films of all time, to the three Lara Croft Tomb Raider films released from 2001 to 2018 – the first of which was given the lowest score possible (“Disaster”) by video game review site? IGN – the list goes on. More recently, 2022’s Halo and Uncharted television and film adaptations have received mixed receptions and criticism for deviating from their video game sources. Frustratingly, there is no reason for this terrible track record. Video games have long been able to tell exciting, emotional stories with rich worlds and beloved characters. All the ingredients, you would think, needed for a television or film hit. But the litany of terrible adaptations demonstrate these ingredients have never been properly used. The Last of Us might be able to break the last three decades’ track record of disastrous adaptations. When the game was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, it received unanimous critical and popular acclaim and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The Last of Us is set in a post-apocalyptic United States of America. Human civilization has collapsed and is contained in quarantined zones after the spread of a highly contagious fungal infection that transforms victims into mindless and aggressive monsters. Players control Joel, a smuggler who lost his only child during the early stages of the outbreak and is escorting teenager Ellie across the country. The game’s characters were played by talented voice actors and motion caption technology was used to ensure the characters were believable and well developed. The emotionally gripping and compelling story and characters won the hearts of video game players, and helped prove video games could tell deep, emotional stories with complex characters. In a 2013 review, IGN called the game a “masterpiece” with a stellar narrative that never slows down or disappoints, and compared it with Cormac McCarthy’s literary work The Road. The success of The Last of Us led to a comic book series, a live reading of parts of the script, downloadable content, a sequel, and a remaster and remake of the first game. A film was announced in 2014 before falling through. When HBO announced in 2020 a television series was in the planning stages, this was met with some scepticism. However, HBO did a lot of things right. One of the original creators of the game, Neil Druckmann, was involved and HBO itself, a network known for premium and compelling content, had the right reputation and values. The show also cast some highly talented actors in Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. Of course, talented actors don’t guarantee a fantastic video game adaption, as the casting of Michael Fassbender, Pablo Schreiber, and Tom Holland in Assassin’s Creed, Halo, and Uncharted illustrate. But what might ensure a successful and well-made video game adaption is just what The Last of Us seems to be using: respect for its video game source material. The Halo and Uncharted adaptions met with a mixed reception partly due to the changes to their source material. The characters and overall narrative were deemed too dissimilar to their original video game sources, leaving viewers frustrated. When a video game adaption is trading on the brand and reputation of its source material, not winning over the original fans and players can leave them with few other audiences. And not ensuring the adaptation is respectful and authentic to the source is the fastest way to lose the original fans. For example, the Halo television series did not cast the original and beloved voice actress from the games for the role of Cortana, a CGI character, on the show before eventually reversing that decision after fan outrage. The Uncharted and The Last of Us video games were developed by the same studio so they might also have learnt from the first adaptation of their games. Dialogue from the video games was used in the scripts, and videos on social media have highlighted how similar clips from the show are to scenes in the video games. Keeping the “soul” of the video games while employing the changes needed to take the story to a different medium was a key aspect of production for Neil Druckmann. And the early rave reviews for The Last of Us praising everything from the writing to the acting suggest that the curse of horrible video game adaptions might have been not just broken but obliterated. It makes sense that The Last of Us, with its compelling characters and story, is just as groundbreaking and acclaimed in another medium.

Audio of a woman moaning was played at high volume just as host Gary Lineker was seeking the opinion of fellow pundit Alan Shearer ahead of Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. “I don’t know who’s making that noise,” said Lineker with a laugh. “Somebody’s sending something on someone’s phone, I think. I don’t know whether you heard it at home.” The former England striker later said a phone had been taped to the back of the studio set as a prank. “As sabotage goes it was quite amusing,” Lineker said on Twitter.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/procrastination-linked-poor-health-study/,[],"University students have a lot of freedom but not much structure. This can be bad for habitual procrastinators. Studies have shown that at least half of university students procrastinate to a level that is potentially harmful to their education. But this may not be the only negative result of putting things off until a later date. Studies have found a link between procrastination and poor health. It is associated with higher levels of stress, unhealthier lifestyles and delays in seeing a doctor about health problems. However, these studies – by the nature of their design – cannot tell us the direction of the relationship. Does procrastination cause poor physical and mental health because people, say, put off starting a new exercise regime or seeing a doctor about a health problem? Or is it the other way around? Does poor physical health, say, lead people to procrastinate because they don’t have the energy to do the task now? To try to solve this riddle, we conducted a longitudinal study – that is, a study that followed people for a period of time, taking measurements at various points in the study. We recruited 3,525 students from eight universities in and around Stockholm and asked them to complete questionnaires every three months for one year. Our study, published in JAMA Network Open, aimed to investigate if students who procrastinate have a higher risk of poor mental and physical health. Of the 3,525 students we recruited, 2,587 answered the follow-up questionnaire nine months later, where several health outcomes were measured. To understand how procrastination relates to later health outcomes, students with a greater tendency to procrastinate (as scored on a procrastination scale) at the start of the study were compared with students with a lower tendency. The results showed that higher levels of procrastination were associated with somewhat higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress nine months later. Students with higher levels of procrastination were also more likely to report disabling pain in the shoulders or arms (or both), worse sleep quality, more loneliness, and more financial difficulties. These associations remained even when we took other factors that could affect the association into consideration, such as age, gender, parents’ level of education, and previous physical and psychiatric diagnoses. Although no specific health outcome was strongly associated with procrastination, the results suggest that procrastination may be of importance for a wide range of health outcomes, including mental health problems, disabling pain, and an unhealthy lifestyle. As mentioned above, in earlier studies, participants were only assessed at one point in time, making it hard to know which of the conditions came first: procrastination or poor health. By getting students to answer questionnaires at several time points, we could be sure that high procrastination levels were present before we measured their health. But it is still possible that other factors not accounted for in our analysis could explain the associations between procrastination and subsequent poor health outcomes. Our results are not proof of cause and effect, but they suggest it more strongly than earlier “cross-sectional” studies. There is good news for habitual procrastinators. Clinical trials (the gold standard of medical research) have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy is effective at reducing procrastination. The treatment helps the person overcome procrastination by breaking up long-term goals into short-term goals, managing distractions (such as turning off mobile phones), and staying focused on a task despite experiencing negative emotions. This requires some effort, so it is not something a person can do while trying to meet a specific deadline. But even small changes can have a large effect. You can try it yourself. Why not start today by leaving your mobile phone in another room when you need to stay focused on a task. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Eva Skillgate is an Associate Professor, Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet.

Jeremy Sochan scored 16 points, all in the first half, for San Antonio, which snapped a five-game losing streak. Tre Jones added 13 points while Jakob Poeltl had 12 points and 8 rebounds in the win. TJ Warren led the Nets with 19 points, who played without Kevin Durant (right knee sprain) and Kyrie Irving (right calf soreness). Brooklyn took its third straight loss despite getting a triple-double – 10 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists – from Ben Simmons. Brooklyn’s Seth Curry scored 16, Nic Claxton added 15 points and 11 rebounds, Cam Thomas also hit for 15 points, and Edmond Sumner tallied 13.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-shell-protect-verde-island-passage/,[],"The United Nations Biodiversity Summit, known as COP15, reached a milestone at the end of 2022. Dubbed “30×30,” a landmark deal saw countries agree to work towards achieving the ambition of conserving 30% of the world’s land and 30% of the ocean by 2030. This signaled an intensified campaign for tackling biodiversity loss which our country has been suffering from in the past decades. However, it appears that the urgency of protecting life on earth still escapes the attention of corporations whose profits seem to outweigh any environmental responsibility. As we enter the new year, my fellow advocates from the Protect VIP, a network of civil society and faith-based groups, youth, and community stakeholders committed to ensuring the incomparable Verde Island Passage whose biodiversity is akin to an “Amazon of the oceans,” brace for the long fight ahead of us. Out to add yet another destructive project along VIP is Shell Energy Philippines. Shell aims to build a P3.5B ($6M) liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in Barangays Libjo, Malitam, and Tabangao-Ambulong in Batangas, a facility that will aim to supply natural gas for power generation allegedly to address the impending depletion of the Malampaya gas field. The project comprises a floating storage and regasification unit with a capacity of 3.8M tons per year, conversion of the jetty, subsea, and onshore gas pipelines, and a pressure reduction metering station. Already a carbon major – that is, a company among the world’s worst fossil fuel polluters – Shell is promoting further pollution and destruction in the Philippines’ climate and waters with its massive gas project. Shell has been under fire for years as one of the carbon majors linked to 71% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, and has been mandated since 2021 by the court of the Netherlands to cut down its emissions by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030. A first-of-its-kind climate investigation by the Human Rights (CHR) has also revealed that there are legal grounds to hold carbon majors like Shell accountable for bringing about climate disasters. Originally, Shell proposed an LNG import terminal project in 2013 which was granted an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Due to development costs and market conditions, the project was put on hold. But Shell has now set its wheels in motion again with a public hearing, which Protect VIP strongly condemns due to the lack of information and significant effort to ensure meaningful participation of stakeholders. It is clearly stated in our law that at the minimum, “people whose socio-economic welfare and cultural heritage are to be affected by the project especially vulnerable sectors and indigenous populations” shall be the audience of any project proponent’s information and education campaign. This wasn’t the case in Shell’s public scoping activity last August 23, 2022, where it failed to invite stakeholders including non-government organizations, people’s organizations, church representatives, hospital representatives, and fisherfolks that stand to be displaced. It is important to note that Shell has consistently failed to invite fisherfolk’s interest groups during the public consultations which will be most affected by the Exclusion Zone SEPH intends to put in effect around its LNG import facility’s Floating Storage Regasification Unit. Another glaring exclusion is that of the Badjao community, an indigenous peoples group whose lives and livelihoods depend on the sea. Isn’t it only just and fair for them to participate in such events when it is their source of livelihood that is on the line? On its website, Shell proudly claims to “aim to be a good neighbor wherever we work, by contributing to the well-being of neighboring communities. We work closely with them to manage the social impacts of our business activities, address any concerns about our operations, and enhance the benefits that we are able to bring.” How can we entrust Shell to live to its word when it blatantly prohibits our participation? How can they work closely with the communities when we are not given a chance to have a public discussion on the impacts of their proposed project? How can they manage the social impacts of their business activities when they don’t listen to the voices of those who will be severely affected? Protect VIP launched its #ShellOutOfVIP campaign last year to amplify its opposition to this gas project and others in the pipeline. This campaign puts forward the voices that must be heard – and which Shell ignored – to convey genuine representation and call for the protection of God’s creations. It is clear that to maintain the integrity of all ecosystems, human activities that contribute to the destruction of our common home must be stopped. As we embrace the promise of new beginnings that come with the turning of the year, so does our commitment to oppose destructive fossil gas projects. We begin the year driven by this conviction: Shell is not welcome in the Verde Island Passage. – Rappler.com Fr. Edwin Gariguez is a long-term advocate for environmental justice and protection.

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/vegan-filipino-barbecue-vegetarian-kitchen-quezon-city/,['STEPH ARNALDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Planning a plant-based Filipino feast at home or for your next potluck? Whether you’re vegan, vegetarian, or trying out a more plant-based diet, here’s a worthy addition to the vegan party – The Vegetarian Kitchen’s (TVK) Vegan Pinoy-style Barbecue! It looks just like the Filipino party staple – glistening in its signature brownish-red sauce, perfectly char-grilled. However, no meat is used here; TVK uses soy protein as a plant-based substitute. The texture is not like pork of course, but it’s got a chewy, firm, and malaman bite that easily absorbs the addictive marinade it’s generously coated in. The distinctive taste is just like your favorite Pinoy barbecue (maybe even better) – savory, sweet, a tad tangy, and smoky. Dip it into spicy vinegar for extra oomph! You’ll definitely be hankering for another cup of rice. TVK uses its own blend of lime soda, soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, cane vinegar, dark brown sugar, banana ketchup, salt, and pepper for the marinade. The process includes rehydrating soy protein by boiling it to a firm consistency and washing it until the aftertaste is gone. The soy protein is then marinated for two days, “so that the flavors will be fully absorbed,” TVK founder Tita Soliongco told Rappler. After this process, she skewers the plant-based meat in bamboo sticks and grills them normally, while glazing them with oil and the marinade reduction. “We wanted to make a dish that was familiar to the Filipino taste, so it could be enjoyed not only by vegans but also non-vegans. First, we introduced the barbecue in our menu using gluten. We decided to use soy protein because the appearance and texture was closer to the meat version,” Tita said. The Pinoy-style Barbecue has been on the menu since the business’ reopening in 1990. “The general feedback is that it ‘tastes like meat’ or ‘are you sure this isn’t pork?’ Most of our customers appreciate that they can eat as much as they want without worrying about the cholesterol. They say it goes well with rice as well as a pulutan,” Tita added, which is true! The Vegetarian Kitchen’s Pinoy-Style Barbecue costs P80 per ala carte stick. It can also come as a meal, with ensaladang talong brown rice. A Half Party Tray costs P620 for 10 sticks, and a Whole Party Tray costs P1,180 for 20 sticks. You can also get a 300-gram frozen pack of six skewers. The Vegetarian Kitchen is also known for serving a moist vegan fruitcake, as well as other “plant-based comfort food” using locally grown produce that aims to bring back memories of home through healthy dishes and baked goods. The restaurant is located along Mother Ignacia Avenue, Quezon City, available only for pick-up and delivery orders as of now. To order, you can message The Vegetarian Kitchen on Facebook or via Viber at 09156434348. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/chinese-lunar-new-year-rabbit-cat-depending-where-live/,[],"On January 22, 2023, more than a billion people globally will welcome the Year of the Rabbit – or the Year of the Cat, depending on which cultural traditions they follow – as the start of the Lunar New Year. In the New York City public school district, Lunar New Year has been observed as a school holiday since 2015. The Lunar New Year is sometimes called the Chinese New Year, because it follows a calendar that was developed in China; but it is also celebrated in various parts of Asia, such as Korea and Vietnam. Tibetan and Mongolian cultures follow a similar calendar that will start the Year of the Rabbit about a month later, on February 20. While this calendar is sometimes just called “lunar,” it adds an extra month every few years to stay in sync with the solar cycle, so it’s technically lunar and solar, or lunisolar. This means that the date of the Lunar New Year in the Gregorian calendar changes from year to year but always falls in January or February. The Gregorian calendar is the solar calendar used today in most parts of the world, including the United States. As a scholar of East Asian religions, I am familiar with the wide range of lunar and lunisolar calendars used in different religions and cultures, and especially with the religious significance of the East Asian lunisolar calendar. The lunisolar calendar that developed in China combines two categories: 12 earthly branches, each of which corresponds to an animal, and 10 heavenly stems, each of which corresponds to one of the five elements – fire, water, wood, metal, and earth – and either the feminine yin or masculine yang force. While this lunisolar calendar brings people together, different countries and cultures have their own legends and customs surrounding the New Year. Even the animal associated with the year can vary. In most parts of East Asia, the new year that begins on January 22 corresponds to the rabbit, and also to the element of water and the feminine yin force. The cycle takes 60 years to complete, so 60th birthdays across East Asia are times for special celebrations. However, the animal associations of the zodiac can vary: In Vietnam, January 22 will usher in the Year of the Cat instead. The most recent Year of the Cat, in 2011, saw a baby boom in Vietnam because of the good luck associated with that zodiac sign. One explanation among scholars for why Vietnamese culture celebrates it as the Year of the Cat is that the earthly branch corresponding to “rabbit” is pronounced mao in Mandarin and meo in Vietnamese, which sounds similar to the Vietnamese word for “cat.” Another explanation comes from two variations of a popular legend about how the 12 zodiac animals were chosen. According to that legend, either the Buddha or the Jade Emperor, head of the Chinese pantheon, organized a race across a river to choose the zodiac animals and their order. In the Chinese version, the cat and rat were riding across a river on an ox when the rat, in its drive to be first, pushed the cat into the water so that the cat arrived last and was disqualified. The rabbit was crossing the river by hopping on stones sticking out of the water, but with one lucky leap it landed on a floating log that swiftly carried it to shore, so that the rabbit finished fourth. However, in the Vietnamese version – which lacks a rabbit – the cat could swim and ended up arriving fourth. In the Chinese tradition, people born in particular zodiac years have some of their animal’s characteristics. Since the late 20th century, Chinese regions have seen birth rates spike during Years of the Dragon because dragons are powerful symbols of good fortune and success. Some animals carry strongly gendered meanings: the Year of the Tiger is widely seen as a good year for male births, but female tigers are stereotyped as overly aggressive. In Korea, the Year of the Horse is similarly perceived as a bad time for girls to be born. Conversely, the Year of the Rabbit is seen as a better year for girls because the rabbit’s qualities of kindness, empathy, and patience are stereotypically feminine virtues. Moreover, rabbits have been associated with male homosexuality since the 18th century, and the word “rabbit,” tuzi in Mandarin, is a slur for male sex workers. The stigma surrounding homosexuality in Chinese cultures means that, for some people, having a boy in the Year of the Rabbit would be less ideal. However, some members of Chinese LGBTQ+ communities are rejecting this stigma by reclaiming the Rabbit God as a patron deity. The Rabbit God is not always understood as a god of male same-sex love. He can also be a symbol of longevity. Chinese lore holds that a rabbit and toad on the Moon work with the moon goddess Chang’e to refine the elixir of immortality. The Year of the Rabbit will feature rabbit decorations, rabbit-themed marketing, and an abundance of new pet rabbits. However, the celebration will remain the same as in other years. Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations emphasize family togetherness as well as good luck and prosperity for the coming year. In China, the Lunar New Year marks the world’s largest annual human migration, as people who work in big cities travel home to see their families for the two-week holiday. The new year officially ushers in the spring, so it is also called Spring Festival, or Chunjie in Mandarin. To start the New Year on the right foot, people get haircuts, clean their houses, and wear new clothes. These new clothes, like most New Year’s decorations, are red, which symbolizes good fortune. New Year’s foods also aim to bring good fortune. Among the dishes commonly eaten at New Year’s is fish, because in Mandarin “having fish,” you yu, is a homophone for “having a surplus.” Eating a dessert of glutinous rice balls in sweet soup, known as tangyuan, represents the family being complete, because the word for round, yuan, also means “complete.” Family is the focus of New Year celebrations, which traditionally take place in the home of the husband’s family. Adults generally give gifts of money in red envelopes to younger relatives who are still in school. On the second or third day of the new year, families often travel to the wife’s family home to see the in-laws. The Lantern Festival, Yuanxiao jie, wraps up the festivities two weeks after the New Year begins with the first full moon of the year. As the name suggests, people celebrate with decorated lanterns, which often have riddles attached. In addition to guessing the answers to these riddles, people celebrate by eating tangyuan or similar round dumplings called yuanxiao, and watching dragon and lion dances. The global Asian diaspora means that Lunar New Year is now celebrated around the world, including in the United States. Chinese American, Korean American, and Vietnamese American communities will mark the beginning of the Lunar New Year with a variety of celebrations, some welcoming the Year of the Rabbit and others welcoming the Year of the Cat. – Rappler.com Megan Bryson is an Associate Professor of Religious Studies, University of Tennessee.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/millions-chinese-workers-travel-lunar-new-year-2023/,[],"BEIJING, China – Millions of urban workers were on the move across China on Wednesday, January 18, ahead of the expected Friday peak of its Lunar New Year mass migration, as China’s leaders looked to get its COVID-battered economy moving. Unfettered when officials in December ended three years of some of the world’s tightest COVID-19 restrictions, workers streamed into railway stations and airports to head to smaller towns and rural homes, sparking fears of a broadening virus outbreak. Economists are scrutinizing the holiday season, known as the Spring Festival, for glimmers of rebounding consumption across the world’s second largest economy after new GDP data on Tuesday, January 17, confirmed a sharp economic slowdown in China. While some analysts expect that recovery to be slow, China’s Vice Premier Liu He declared to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Tuesday that China was open to the world after three years of pandemic isolation. National Immigration Administration officials said that, on average, half a million people had been moved in or out of China per day since its borders opened on January 8, state media reported. But as workers flood out of megacities, such as Shanghai, where officials say the virus has peaked, many are heading to towns and villages where unvaccinated elderly have yet to be exposed to COVID and health care systems are less equipped. As the COVID surge intensified, some were putting the virus out of their mind as they headed for the departure gates. Travelers bustled through railway stations and subways in Beijing and Shanghai, many ferrying large wheeled suitcases and boxes stuffed with food and gifts. “I used to be a little worried (about the COVID-19 epidemic),” said migrant worker Jiang Zhiguang, waiting among the crowds at Shanghai’s Hongqiao Railway Station. “Now it doesn’t matter anymore. Now it’s okay if you get infected. You’ll just be sick for two days only,” Jiang, aged 30, told Reuters. The infection rate in the southern city of Guangzhou, capital of China’s most populous province, has now passed 85%, local health officials announced on Wednesday. In more isolated areas, state medical workers are this week going door-to-door in some outlying villages to vaccinate the elderly, with the official Xinhua news agency describing the effort on Tuesday as the “last mile.” Clinics in rural villages and towns are now being fitted with oxygenators, and medical vehicles have also been deployed to isolated areas. While authorities confirmed on Saturday a huge increase in deaths – announcing that nearly 60,000 people with COVID had died in hospitals between December 8 and January 12 – state media reported that heath officials were not yet ready to give the World Health Organization (WHO) the extra data it is now seeking. Specifically, the UN agency wants information on so-called excess mortality – the number of all deaths beyond the norm during a crisis, the WHO said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the official People’s Daily, quoted Chinese experts saying the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention was already monitoring such data, but it would take time before it could be released. Doctors in both public and private hospitals were being actively discouraged from attributing deaths to COVID, Reuters reported on Tuesday. – Rappler.com"

He will get a chance to do the same for Gilas Pilipinas in the sixth and final window of the FIBA World Cup Asian Qualifiers in February after becoming a naturalized Filipino. Fulfilling a dream that took years in the making, Brownlee pledged his oath of allegiance as a Filipino citizen at the Philippine Senate in Pasay on Monday, January 16. “As a citizen, I will try my best to make the Filipino people proud. I want to keep making you guys proud and to do whatever I can to help the national team,” said Brownlee. Brownlee delivered stellar numbers in the Commissioner’s Cup finals as the Gin Kings prevented the Dragons from becoming the first guest team to win a PBA title in over four decades. In the best-of-seven series that went the distance, the three-time Best Import put up 32.1 points, 11.4 rebounds, 7 assists, 2.4 steals, and 2 blocks to capture his sixth championship with Ginebra over nine conferences with the team. Overall, Brownlee is a perfect 6-of-6 in the finals. “Representing Ginebra, of course, is a huge thing – it’s a big deal as far as basketball is concerned over here in the Philippines,” he said. “But representing the country is an even bigger deal. That’s why in that series [against Bay Area], it felt like we were representing the whole country.” The 34-year-old will don the national colors for the first time when Gilas Pilipinas hosts Lebanon and Jordan on February 24 and 27, respectively, at the Philippine Arena in Bulacan to wrap up the Asian Qualifiers. “I feel great and I’m pretty excited to be representing the country,” he said.

Miranda and Abarrientos take over for PBA legend Olsen Racela, who parted ways with the illustrious UAAP program after the Tamaraws bottomed out to seventh place in Season 85 – their worst finish in 26 years and the first non-Final Four run since 2012. “Of course, I’m grateful for the opportunity FEU gave me.

I’m excited to be a rookie coach going up against heavyweights. You know my identity as a player. It’s all hard work.” Miranda will take over a team in flux, but still led at the moment by LJay Gonzales, Cholo Anonuevo, Xyrus Torres, and Bryan Sajonia.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/korean-popular-music/asian-leg-itzy-checkmate-tour-start-show-manila-january-2023/,['RUSSELL KU'],"MANILA, Philippines – “Icy but I’m on fire” may just be a line from ITZY’s sophomore title track “ICY,” but it also defines how the K-pop girl group became leaders of the fourth generation through the members’ powerful performance and cool attitude. ITZY continued to show that persona to Filipino MIDZYs as the group became one of the first K-pop acts to perform in the Philippines this year, bringing their CHECKMATE world tour to the Mall of Asia Arena on January 14 and 15. Member Lia said that the Manila stop was an “amazing start” to the Asian leg of the tour. The group had brought the CHECKMATE tour to Seoul and the United States before coming to the Philippines. Concert promoter Live Nation Philippines had added the January 15 show after tickets sold out for ITZY’s initial January 14 concert. “Having a solo concert [has] always been our dream so we put more into this concert than ever before to achieve our dream and prepared new performances that our MIDZYs would like to see,” member Chaeryeong added. Before the show, ITZY also witnessed deafening cheers from MIDZYs at their press event on January 13. ITZY started the concert with a bang with “Mafia in the morning,” followed by “Sorry Not Sorry,” “SHOOT!” “365,” and “What I Want.” ITZY also greeted MIDZYs in Filipino, drawing cheers from the concert crowd. The group also used English for most of the show to communicate with fans. Leader Yeji was impressed by Filipino MIDZYs, saying that when she was supposed to ask them to stand up, they were already standing for the next set of songs. ITZY followed the opening set with “Cherry,” “ICY,” “Free Fall,” and their viral B-side track “#Twenty.” Filipino MIDZYs chanted and sang their hearts out as ITZY saved their most famous and energetic hits, such as their debut song “Dalla Dalla,” “Wannabe,” and “Sneakers,” for the second half of the show. Lia and Ryujin admitted that this part of the show was “difficult,” as they had to put a lot of energy into their performances. But their struggles didn’t show as the group gave precise, synchronized, and impactful moves throughout the concert. The members also shared that the weather in Manila at that time was “very nice” as it helped keep their throat conditions in tip-top shape for the concert. In between group performances, the ITZY members presented solo stages, covering songs that highlighted the members’ distinct flavors and personalities. MIDZYs witnessed Lia’s passionate rendition of “Red,” Ryujin’s charismatic performance of “Boss Bitch,” Yuna’s bubbly cover of “Maniac,” Chaeryeong’s sexy interpretation of “bloodline,” and Yeji’s attractive version of “Hotter Than Hell.” Yuna said she was thankful for the cheering from MIDZYs as she would tend to feel “awkward” when performing her solo stage. After ITZY performed all of their solo performances, the group finally performed their latest single “Cheshire” for the first time on tour, donning new denim outfits. The outfits were a change from their preppy attire worn during the same part of their US concerts. As ITZY moved towards the end of their official set with title tracks “LOCO” and “Not Shy,” Filipino MIDZYs said, “Walang uuwi (No one is going home)” as the members challenged them to mission challenges for their encore stage. After MIDZYs completed the missions, ITZY sang “Domino,” fan-dedicated song “Trust Me (MIDZY),” their English single “Boys Like You,” and “Nobody Like You.” As the show came to a close, the ITZY members thanked Filipino MIDZYs for waiting for more than three years to see them live once more. “I always see Filipino MIDZYs in [our] video calls and they always wanted us to come in [the] Philippines so bad and now we finally [came]. Sorry [if] it [took] a little long time, but thank you for greeting us like this,” Ryujin said. “I think after COVID and with more chances like this [in] actually getting to meet our MIDZYs, that kind of motivated me more to have more greed and passion,” Lia added. Filipino MIDZYs pulled out all the stops to make the Manila show an emotional experience for them and for ITZY. A group of fans called the #ITZYinMANILA Fan Union, also known as the Filo MIDZY Alliance, prepared several projects to show how the group would forever be etched on their hearts. “If we truly want to make their stay here in the Philippines memorable, we will go to any lengths to make that happen. We won’t really think about the difficulties; we’ll just get things done,” said Kai, one of the admins of Filo MIDZY Alliance. Aside from having to gather resources and approval from JYP Entertainment and Live Nation Philippines, the admins told Rappler that their “toughest challenge” was having to balance these duties with their everyday tasks. On the second day of the concert, the group prepared a surprise video for ITZY which showed their journey from their debut during their encore set, moving the members to tears. “I was able to realize that all our efforts and hard work that we have poured so all of these fans could gather to see us today, I really thought that it’s all worth it,” Yeji said in Korean. Star, the video editor for the project, told Rappler that she was “literally [on] cloud nine” and was thankful for how ITZY reacted to her work. She was not able to make it to the concert as she is based in the United States. Chaeryeong, fighting back tears, expressed how the Manila stop reminded her of the reason why she is a performer today. It was also at that point when she noticed a banner that FMA made along the upper box section which read: “Beyond the spring, summer, fall, winter seasons. Until the moment, we meet again.” “Being in a place filled with MIDZYs only and listening to all of your cheers and chants for us, I was really really happy,” she added. ITZY’s reactions also touched the hearts of the FMA admins. “No words can truly summarize how we feel…. If given another shot, I’d do it all over again,” Zippy said. As confetti flew around the Mall of Asia Arena during the show’s closing moments, ITZY and MIDZY gathered their hands (and light rings) together to chant “ITZY, MIDZY, Nalja (fly high)” as a promise for both the group and Filipino fans to keep working hard to achieve their dreams. “MIDZY, mahalaga kayo sa amin. Kita tayo ulit, Manila (MIDZY, you are important to us. Let’s see each other again, Manila),” the group said in a tweet. – Rappler.com"

Catriona, together with American Ninja Warrior co-host Zuri Hall, served as a backstage commentator for the 71st Miss Universe coronation night at New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, on Saturday, January 14 (morning of January 15 in Manila). Miss Universe 2012 Olivia Culpo and television host Jeannie Mai Jenkins were the coronation night’s main hosts. “Achievement unlocked,” she wrote. “It’s always been a dream to be in the hosting line-up of Miss Universe.” The photos saw Catriona in the two ensembles she wore for the finals night: a powder blue gown with asymmetrical cuts and a golden yellow dress with a high slit. She also shared a behind-the-scenes video with Zuri, saying that she “[loved] working with [an] amazingly talented being.” “Between the laughs and the dancing, it almost didn’t feel like work at all,” she added. Zuri, meanwhile, commented on Catriona’s post with: “You are so talented and such a light! Thank you for being such a fun, gracious co-host, my dear.” While Catriona has hosted several coronation nights for national pageants, this marked the first time for the Filipino-Australian beauty queen to host for a Miss Universe event. She was last seen in the pageant’s international stage in 2019 when she crowned her successor, Zozibini Tunzi of South Africa. The Philippine’s bet, Celeste Cortesi, failed to advance to the pageant’s Top 16. USA’s R’Bonney Gabriel won the crown.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/macau-court-sentences-junket-mogul-alvin-chau-prison-term/,[],"HONG KONG – A local court sentenced a top Macau gambling boss to 18 years in prison after he was found guilty of charges including enabling illegal gaming, Hong Kong broadcaster TVB reported on Wednesday, January 18. Alvin Chau was chairman of Macau’s Suncity junket – which brokered the gambling activity of Chinese high rollers – until December 2021, a month after his arrest. The sentence marks a dramatic turnaround for the businessman, who was also found guilty of running a criminal syndicate and money laundering, and who once presided over the gambling hub’s VIP industry. Chau denied all wrongdoing during his two-month trial, which was watched closely by many in the former Portuguese colony, where he has a celebrity-like status. Chau must pay the Macau government more than HK$6.5 billion ($830.66 million) as well as HK$178 million to HK$770 million to casino operators MGM China, Wynn Macau , Sands China 1268.HK, Galaxy Entertainment, and SJM Holdings, TDM said. Macau is the only city in China where citizens are permitted to gamble in casinos. Tax revenues from its casinos account for more than 80% of government income. Chau’s lawyers had argued that he did not operate any illegal gambling or commit money laundering and that his business in the Philippines was permitted by local authorities there. No one from Suncity Group had promoted gambling on the mainland, his lawyers said. Junket operators help facilitate gambling for wealthy Chinese in Macau, extending them credit and collecting on their debt on behalf of casino operators. Marketing or soliciting gambling in mainland China is illegal. Chau’s Suncity was a major player in Macau until 2019, before prior the coronavirus outbreak, accounting for about 25% of total gaming revenues, industry executives said. That year, Macau casinos generated $36 billion in revenue. The junket industry has collapsed in the former Portuguese colony since Chau’s arrest, with all of Suncity’s VIP rooms shuttered. Many other operators folded, hurt by poor sentiment and a lack of business due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Macau’s government still permits junkets to operate but they face far more scrutiny after new legislation approved in December last year which regulates their licensing and activities. Junkets are now only allowed to partner with a single casino; before they could work with as many as they wanted with little oversight. – Rappler.com $1 = HK$7.8251"

Rescue teams used drones and rappelled down deep gorges on Tuesday, January 17, to sift through the charred remains of the Yeti Airlines ATR 72 turboprop, which was carrying 72 people when it crashed near the tourist city of Pokhara on Sunday morning. “There is no possibility of finding any survivor. We have collected 71 bodies so far. The search for the last one will continue,” Tek Bahadur K.C., a top district official in Pokhara, said on Wednesday. Identifying bodies and accounting for all 72 people has been difficult because of the state of the remains, said Ajay K.C, a police official at the rescue site. “Until the hospital tests show all 72 bodies, we’ll continue to search for the last person,” Ajay K.C said. Search teams found 68 bodies on the day of the crash, and two more were recovered on Monday before the search was called off.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/statements-press-freedom-advocates-acquittal-tax-evasion/,['RYAN MACASERO'],"MANILA, Philippines – Press freedom advocates from the Philippines and around the world celebrated the acquittal of Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, chief executive officer of Rappler, and Rappler Holdings Corporation by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on Wednesday, January 18.

“The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines welcomes the acquittal of Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation at the Court of Tax Appeals,” the NUJP said in a statement on Wednesday morning, following news of the acquittal. The NUJP called the verdict “a win for journalists and the rule of law.” “The cases against Maria and Rappler illustrate the increasing use of the law for reprisal against and for intimidation against journalists and civil society,” the group said. “We congratulate Maria and Rappler for this legal victory and for their resoluteness and perseverance in the face of the cases. While colleagues similarly face legal challenges – from libel to made-up terrorism charges – in relation to their work, we take inspiration from this acquittal that if we stand up and hold the line, we can win.” The NUJP echoed the earlier statement of Ressa, who said her victory was “not just for Rappler” but for every Filipino “who has been unjustly accused.” Ressa mentioned others who are still waiting for verdicts in their cases such as community journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, who was 21 when she was arrested in Tacloban City, Leyte, in February 2020, and former senator and justice secretary Leila de Lima, who was arrested under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. “It’s a ray of sunshine, hope – for those like journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, who begins her fourth year in prison in February and Leila de Lima, who begins her seventh year in prison in February as well,” Ressa said. The acquittal comes four years after the previous Duterte government filed the cases against Ressa and Rappler. (READ: LIST: Cases vs Maria Ressa, Rappler directors, staff since 2018) The International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), which is part of the Hold The Line Coalition steering committee, said the verdict shows “it is possible for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to hit reset on his predecessor’s vast campaign of media repression.” “We hope we are seeing the beginning of an end to the previous administration’s strategy to instrumentalize the courts as a means to undermine independent news organizations and damage journalists’ credibility. As an immediate next step, we call for all remaining cases against Rappler and Ressa to be closed and their constant persecution to be stopped once and for all,” ICFJ and the Hold The Line Coalition steering committee said. Meanwhile, Philippine environmental organization Kalikasan PNE said: “We join human rights advocates in celebrating the acquittal of our partners from Rappler! The fight continues against disinformation and attacks against the critical journalism crucial in our era of economic and ecological crisis.” Human Rights Watch senior researcher Carlos Conde said the acquittal of Ressa and Rappler was “very welcome news.” “It is a victory for press freedom in the Philippines. We’re happy that the Court of Tax Appeals saw no basis for the charges. We have always maintained that these were bogus and politically motivated. We hope the courts rule similarly in the other questionable cases Maria and her colleagues at Rappler have been forced to face,” Conde said. The CTA voted 3-0 to decide the “non-taxability of the issuance of PDRs to North Base Media and Omidyar Network.” The court added, “No gain or income was realized by accused in the subject transactions.” (READ: FAST FACTS: Who are the PH tax court justices who cleared Maria Ressa, Rappler Holdings?) The junking of the four tax cases at the CTA leaves three active court cases against Rappler and Ressa: the appeal of Ressa and former researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. in their conviction for cyber libel pending at the Supreme Court, the lone tax case at the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, and the appeal on the closure of Rappler pending at the Court of Appeals. Global human rights watchdog Amnesty International lauded the CTA’s verdict, adding that it is also time for other cases against Ressa and Rappler to be dropped. “Amnesty International welcomes the decision to drop charges of tax evasion against prominent journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa. We call on authorities to now drop cyber libel and other additional charges looming over Ressa so she can continue doing her job,” Butch Olano, Amnesty International Philippines section director, said in a statement. “The cyber libel provision of the Cybercrime Prevention Act continues to be misused and abused by the authorities to intimidate journalists and harass human rights defenders speaking truth to power. This practice threatens the right to freedom of expression and the press, and further drives impunity in the government,” he added. Women’s rights group LILAK said in a statement it would stand and hold the line “to defend press freedom and uphold our freedom to speak truth and battle lies.” “We hope that other cases filed against journalists and the media, including the case of journalist Frank Cimatu, will be dropped, the perpetrators of the killings of journalists will be prosecuted. Justice delayed is justice denied,” LILAK added. A Quezon City court convicted Baguio City journalist and Rappler contributor Frank Cimatu of cyber libel in December 2022 over a Facebook post. Meanwhile, the Movement Against Disinformation (MAD) challenged the Marcos administration to “reverse repressive actions of his predecessor, particularly those that impede freedom of the press.” “Truth is one of the most fundamental pillars of democracy, and the ability of journalists to report freely on matters of public interest is crucial. MAD will continue to stand with journalists in their struggle for press freedom,” MAD said. – Rappler.com As we celebrate the triumph of facts over politics, we want to thank you, our readers, for holding the line with us through the years.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/golden-state-warriors-advocate-celebrate-latest-title-white-house-ceremony/,[],"Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors celebrated another NBA championship at the White House on Tuesday, January 17. At the invitation of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is from the Bay Area and was a US senator from California, the Warriors were at the White House for the first time since 2016. They were honored for their NBA Finals victory over the Celtics in June 2022. Curry and Golden State defeated Boston to claim their fourth title in eight years. An invitation to the White House was withdrawn by then-President Donald Trump in 2017 after Curry said he wouldn’t attend if asked. “It’s something we don’t ever take for granted. Seven years ago we were here last celebrating our first championship,” Curry said. “Now we’re back here celebrating our fourth. To have this opportunity to reflect on this accomplishment last year, to bring everybody together to celebrate that, to also acknowledge that sports bring people together from all walks of life, backgrounds to provide inspiration, love, togetherness. That’s what our journey was last year. To have the opportunity to celebrate that means a lot to us.” Curry thanked Biden and his staff for bringing WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner back to the US from Russian captivity. “It means a lot to know that she’s here and home safe with her family,” Curry said. Veterans Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson also joined head coach Steve Kerr in a roundtable with White House staff members regarding gun control reform and measures planned to impact the hardest-hit communities. Kerr’s father, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated by terrorists who shot him outside of his office at the University of Beirut, where he was campus president, in 1984. “We learned a lot about what this administration is doing to help create a safer environment in our country, something that’s very close to my heart,” Kerr said. Kerr spoke before Curry on Tuesday and said his message to the team was an obvious one. “It’s a great reminder of how lucky we are to be Americans, to live in a country where we can chase our dreams,” Kerr said. It was the first time that a sitting US president had received the team since Biden’s fellow Democrat Barack Obama in 2016, after Trump revoked their invitation in 2017 and declined to extend one a year later. Thompson and other members of the team chuckled and looked down sheepishly as Biden said, “Let me just say that the Golden State Warriors are always welcome in this White House,” adding emphasis to “this.” The Warriors’ title win in June capped a remarkable turnaround for the franchise, after the previous two seasons had ended in disappointment. “You struggled in 2020, missed the playoffs in ’21 and critics wondered if this team was gone for good as a championship team,” said Biden, who twice before unsuccessfully ran for president. “Fellas, I know what it feels like. I’ve been there.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the Warriors had a record of 22-22 this season, seventh in the Western Conference standings. The team remained in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after defeating the Wizards Monday night and next head to Boston to face the Celtics on Thursday night. – Rappler.com"

We earn a commission every time you shop through the affiliate links below. Sometimes, shorter is better. POV: You’re staring at your bookshelf and trying to will yourself into getting back into that novel you’ve been trying to finish for weeks, nay, months. You stare at all the books you’ve read and the ever-growing TBR pile. You resign back to your phone, accepting the fact that you’re in a reading slump. Hey, we’ve all been there. Taking a hiatus from reading doesn’t mean you’re no longer a bookworm, and it certainly doesn’t mean you can’t bring back that drive to read. If one of your New Years’ resolutions is to reignite that fire, a short story or essay collection could be your best bet to get back on the saddle. Unlike grandiose novels, short pieces with fascinating characters and quick resolutions could likely get you back to reading well after the pages are done. They could also help if you’re feeling overwhelmed with long prose.  Bite-sized entries will help you keep track of your reading count (if you’re that type of reader). Prepare your shelves, here are some captivating short reads that will have you grabbing the next book… and the next… and the next. Who doesn’t love reading about the rise and fall of relationships – what more if it’s in the context of Filipino references like Jolly Spaghetti, (metaphorically) cold bus rides to the province, and every emotion in between? This short yet hard-hitting collection of stories from up-and-coming writer Jade Mark Capiñanes captures how everyday objects can remind us of loves lost, found, and forgotten. It’s a quick yet memorable read for book lovers and, well, lovers in general. Sometimes, you just need a “WTF did I just read” moment to get you back into reading. ‘Severance’ Author Ling Ma is back with eight wonderfully weird stories of the human condition that will likely keep you up all night. They’re not weird because they’re particularly out-of-this-world, mind you, but because of how real she tackles toxic relationships, motherhood, and more. Do you remember your childhood home? Your playmates, the families, the first crushes? Though there’s much to be said about the spaces we had growing up, no one writes it quite like Sandra Cisneros. This delightfully warm short read chronicles the people and experiences she had as a young girl before she moves into ‘A House of My Own.’ Though it’s technically a novel, the parts are broken up into very short sections that will have you finished in no time. Similar to ‘Bliss Montage,’ this short story collection also tackles the human condition, but introduces wacky high-concept elements that perfectly captured this sci-fi lover’s heart. The stories range from someone working in the “grief industry,” a first-person narrative about a video game protagonist, to a how-to on asking out your coworker… in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. No matter your take on John Green and his widely famous “I was a drizzle, she was a hurricane” quotes, one can’t deny that he knows how to write. Here, John takes a pause from fiction to write reviews about, well, everything. With the Anthropocene meaning our current geological age, John takes time to thoughtfully review everything from Halley’s Comet, QWERTY keyboards, air conditioners, to the notes app. His reviews are both rich in detail and fascinatingly personal, as he wrote most of the book amid the pandemic. As an avid John Green reader in my teens, reading this also felt like talking to an old friend again. He and I might have changed over the years, but I could still listen to him talk for hours. In the words of Green himself, I give ‘The Anthropocene Reviewed’ five stars. Whether you have a target count this year or simply want to get back to the craft, these collections will prove that reading is a love that you can return to at any time.  – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/timeline-bir-tax-evasion-complaint-maria-ressa-holdings-corporation/,[],"This story was first published on April 17, 2018. We have updated it to reflect latest developments, specifically the acquittal of the accused, Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation. MANILA, Philippines – The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) 1st Division on Wednesday, January 18, acquitted Rappler chief executive officer and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC) of four charges of tax evasion. The decision involved a tax evasion case filed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) against RHC – part of a series of complaints from government agencies that have been going after the social news network since then-president Rodrigo Duterte accused it of being foreign-owned and funded by the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency. The BIR argued that RHC, as a dealer in securities – a claim disputed by Rappler – is subject to income tax and value-added tax. As defined in the tax code, a dealer in securities is “a merchant of stocks or securities, whether an individual, partnership or corporation, with an established place of business, regularly engaged in the purchase of securities and the resale thereof to customers; that is, one who, as a merchant, buys securities and re-sells them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom.” RHC has said it issued Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) amounting to P188 million only and did so to raise capital and grow its business. It did not make a profit from the issuances. On January 18, 2023, the CTA ordered the acquittal of Ressa and RHC for “failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” The CTA justices said “no gain or income was realized” by Ressa and RHC through the PDR transactions. Here’s a rundown of events surrounding the tax evasion complaint and its conclusion after more than four years: Rappler Holdings issues 12,028,718 PDRs to investment firm North Base Media Limited. (READ: TIMELINE: The case of Rappler’s SEC registration) A PDR is a financial instrument that allows foreigners to invest in a Filipino company, without owning any part of it. This is consistent with the Constitution, which states that mass media in the Philippines should be wholly owned by Filipinos. A PDR is not equivalent to a share in the company. It does not amount to ownership. Rappler is the first media startup in the Philippines to join broadcasting network giants ABS-CBN and GMA in offering PDRs to international investors. Rappler Holdings publishes a report announcing its partnership with North Base. Rappler Holdings files Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-1 – for confirmation of exempt transactions – for the 264,601 PDRs sold to North Base. Rappler Holdings files a subsequent SEC Form 10-1 for the 11,764,117 PDRs sold to North Base. Rappler Holdings issues 7,217,257 PDRs to Omidyar Network Fund LLC. Rappler Holdings publishes a report announcing Omidyar Network’s investment. Rappler Holdings files SEC Form 10-1 for the 7,217,257 PDRs issued to Omidyar Network. The SEC revokes Rappler’s license to operate because the PDRs of Omidyar Network supposedly violate the constitutional restrictions on ownership. Omidyar Network announces it has donated its PDRs to 14 Filipino managers of Rappler, in an effort “to address the unwarranted ruling” made by the SEC. Five days after the PDR donation, the BIR delivers to the Rappler office a notice dated March 2, requesting for various documents related to a tax examination of Rappler Holdings. In just three days, the BIR publishes a press release on its website announcing a tax evasion complaint against Rappler Holdings, alleging that the firm, together with its president Maria Ressa and treasurer James Bitanga, willfully attempted to evade tax payments, as well as failed to provide accurate information in its income tax and value-added tax returns for 2015. BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay writes a referral letter to Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II that “RHC, Ms. Ressa, and Mr. Bitanga are being charged for willful attempt to evade or defeat tax and deliberate failure to supply correct and accurate information for taxable year 2015.” Rappler Holdings finds out via Twitter that the BIR filed a tax evasion complaint against the firm, even if the firm has not submitted to the BIR any documents for assessment and investigation as of this period. Rappler Holdings questions the BIR’s grounds for filing a criminal complaint against its two executives for allegedly evading P133.8 million in taxes. The firm’s lawyer Francis Lim says Rappler Holdings cannot be considered a dealer in securities when it issued the PDRs to Omidyar Network and North Base. “Rappler was the issuer; it did not buy the PDRs.” (READ: Rappler lawyer cites loopholes in BIR’s tax complaint) Lim also says Rappler Holdings did not resell the shares it bought from Rappler Incorporated. He points out that the PDRs of Rappler Holdings are different from the Rappler Incorporated shares. “Those two are distinct financial iinstruments.” Lim, senior partner at Angara Abello Concepcion Regala and Cruz Law Offices, also argues that the capital raised from issued PDRs had not yet been booked by Rappler as income. Rappler Holdings receives the tax evasion complaint from the BIR. Ressa and Bitanga also receive a subpoena from the Department of Justice (DOJ) over the complaint. The subpoena is signed by Assistant State Prosecutor Zenamar J.L. Machacon-Caparros on April 11. The assistant state prosecutor orders Ressa and Bitanga to submit their “counter-affidavit and other supporting documents” or affidavits by witnesses, if any, at 11 am. Two dates are listed: April 24 and May 7. The seven government offices that have taken action against Rappler include the Office of the Solicitor General, SEC, DOJ, National Bureau of Investigation, Malacañang, Department of Education, and now, the BIR. The DOJ indicts Rappler Holdings and Maria Ressa for tax evasion and failure to file tax returns, stating that through PDRs the company “gained close to P162.5 million from the transaction, which it failed to declare in its tax return.” Assistant Prosecutor Caparros signs the indictment. The DOJ makes public the resolution indicting Rappler Holdings and Ressa. “The National Prosecution Service (NPS) has found probable cause to indict Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC), its President Maria Ressa and its independent Certified Public Accountant Noel Baladiang for violation of the National Internal Revenue Code or the tax code,” the justice department says in a statement. The DOJ files three counts of failure to file tax returns and one count of tax evasion against Rappler Holdings and Ressa before the CTA. The justice department proceeds with the filing of cases despite the respondents’ filing of a motion for reconsideration. Judge Danilo Buemio signs an arrest warrant for Ressa who has been charged with violating Section 255 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. The arrest warrant, however, is released to the public by Pasig City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 265 on December 3. Ressa posts bail of P60,000 at Pasig City RTC Branch 265 for alleged violation of the tax code. In posting bail, Ressa does not waive her right to question the jurisdiction of the Pasig City court over this case. Rappler Holdings and Maria Ressa file a motion to quash before the Pasig City court, asking it to void the charges, if not remand the investigation to the DOJ – or at least suspend proceedings while they avail of appeal remedies. Ressa posts bail at the CTA over four charges of alleged violation of the tax code. She posts P204,000 (about $4,000) in bail ahead of the issuance of warrants of arrest. Citing lack of jurisdiction and absence of due process, Rappler and Ressa ask the CTA to nullify the tax evasion case filed against them and remand it to the DOJ. The CTA denies Rappler and Ressa’s appeal and decides to proceed with the trial over four counts of alleged tax violations. The CTA says the motion to quash is moot as the DOJ already denied the appeal in November 2018. Ressa testifies before the CTA, the first time she takes the stand after a series of cases filed during the Duterte administration. She is the last witness to be presented by the defense. The case is submitted for decision. The CTA acquits Ressa and Rappler Holdings of four charges of tax evasion. The victory ends more than four years of trial of a case filed in March 2018 during the Duterte administration. – with reports by Chrisee dela Paz and Rappler Research/Rappler.com More information on Rappler’s cases: TIMELINE: The case of Rappler’s SEC registration

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/faces-people-sinulog-2023/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – For Cebuanos, 2023 started with a bang: the return of the Sinulog, the most highly celebrated event in Central Visayas’ main island. For two years, the COVID-19 pandemic had forced devotees of the Señor Sto. Niño to keep indoors, attending the Novena Masses via their television sets, computers, and mobile phones. The streets of Cebu were absent of the processions, street parades, and the dancing and singing crowds emblematic of the Sinulog. On Sinulog day, January 15, Rappler talked to some of the faces in Cebu City’s streets. Van Clinton Pilla crossed the sea to offer a performance to the Sto. Niño. He is part of the eleven-person creative team of Omega de Salonera of Surigao del Norte. Rappler talked with him before the Grand Ritual Showdown, and before the awarding ceremony where his team — all first-timers to Sinulog were declared winners in the Grand Ritual Showdown -Free Interpretation. “Ang among giari is to showcase our culture in Bucas Grande island. This is called the “Hinabangay.” So kung baga, helping together,” he told Rappler. (We came here to showcase our culture in Bucas Grande island. This is called “Hinabangay.” This means helping each other.) Hinabangay is a month-long festival celebrated in Bucas Grande Island in honor of Señor San Nicolas de Tolentino. During the month-long celebration, members of the community offer their labor for free in the spirit of helping or “tinabangay.” In line with their wish to showcase this culture of offering and giving, the team behind Omega de Salonera’s performance offered their services for free. “Tanan trabahante namo, from props making, pintor, wa nay bayad tanan. Sama sa kanta, ‘ihalad ang kinabuhi aron malipay ang Ginoo’. Which is literal gyud nga nahitabo sa amoa,” he said. (Every single one of the people behind this team, from props-making, to painters, offered their services for free. It’s like how the song goes, ‘offer your life to make God happy’. Which is literally what happened to us.) Despite the difficulty of traveling to Cebu, Pilla said the team was grateful and eager. Asked about the controversial venue of Sinulog 2023, he said they are used to rain and mud. They had been practicing tirelessly since November of 2022, he added. “Even though the SRP location, naa’y issue na maot kaayo, lapok kaayo, for us… grabe nindot kaayo ang venue para sa amoa. We really think that it is made for us because perfect kaayo iyang sizing and space… so para namo, perfect timing ang pag intra namo sa Sinulog,” he said. (Even though the SRP location has been marred with issues that it’s bad or muddy, for us… it’s great. We really think that it is made for us because the sizing and the space is perfect. For us it’s really perfect timing that we entered Sinulog.) And he was not wrong. Apart from winning the coveted Ritual Showdown (Free Interpretation Category), they were also declared Best in Street Dancing, Best in Costume, and placed second for Musicality. Jesson Morata is an external assistant manager for marketing in a business process outsourcing (BPO) company in Cebu. Despite the heat of the sun and the slow pace of the parade, Morata and his co-workers tirelessly danced beside their company’s float, taking pictures with the crowd of spectators, and keeping the energy high. This, he said, was their company’s seventh year of joining the Sinulog Grand parade. “This is our 7th time to join Sinulog and this is for the books so to speak because we’re used to the old route and medyo comfortable na and this is the first time,” he said, referring to the new venue. “There were so many challenges a few days before but now we are… but so far so good,” he added. The BPO industry is a large contributor to the city’s economy and one of its biggest job generators. Morata’s company employs 8,000 workers. To be able to achieve such a wide workforce, the BPO industry needs to be inclusive, Morata “Regardless of your age, race, and sexual orientation, beliefs, we welcome everyone with open arms. The BPO industry is one of the most vibrant and most promising. We all know that all industries are affected with what happened by COVID and Odette but here we are, still providing opportunities for everyone,” he told Rappler. Jin-jin Ouano is from the City of Mandaue, a local government unit neighboring Cebu City. Under the heat of the noon sun, she sat by the sidewalk, a couple of blocks from the Basilica Minore del Sto. Niño De Cebu. She formed part of the sea of devotees entering and leaving the packed Basilica, praying to the Sto. Niño before they carry on with the revelry. “Mawala imong kapoy magbaktas kay mahingag ka sa uban. Katong pag-pandemic kay live ra man to. Sa TV screen ra magtan-aw,” she said. (Your exhaustion from walking would go away because of all the people surrounding you.  In the pandemic we only watched the celebration live from our TVs.) “Sukad sa pandemic, karon ra ko kabalik. Kay katong wala pa’y pandemic, sige mi’g laag sa Sinulog. Sa plaza ra mi,” she added. (This is my first time back since the pandemic. Before the pandemic, we used to be out during Sinulog. We used to stay at the plaza.) She says her family opted out of their traditional watching the Sinulog Grand Parade due to distance of the new venue. But she joins the rest of the devotees in praying for the continuation of the yearly Sinulog celebration. “Unta hatagan mi og maayong panlawas unya mapadayon ni hangtod sa hangtod nga walay kakulian. Padayon ang pagpangaliya sa mga katawhan. Ana ra. Mao ra ug grasya adlaw-adlaw,” she told Rappler (I pray for good health and that thus continues forever without interruption. For the continued intercession of everyone. That’s all. As well as that we be blessed with graces every day.) – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/things-to-know-court-tax-appeals-justices-maria-ressa-cases/,['JODESZ GAVILAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Who comprise the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) 1st Division that decided in favor of Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation in the tax evasion case filed during the Duterte administration? The CTA 1st Division that handed down its decision on Wednesday, January 18, is composed of three justices: Associate Justice Catherine Triunfante Manahan, Associate Justice Jean Marie Bacorro-Villena, and Associate Justice Marian Ivy Reyes-Fajardo. It is only Manahan who was part of the original set of justices who first tried the case at the CTA. During the May 29, 2019 hearing, CTA Presiding Justice Roman del Rosario recused himself from the cases after he expressed his view that RHC as an entity should be arraigned, a stand that the two other justices disagreed with. Justice Manahan was asked to preside over these cases. (Editor’s Note: In an earlier version of this article, we reported that Presiding Justice Roman del Rosario inhibited when he was nominated to the Supreme Court. This has been corrected.) Associate Justice Esperanza Victorino retired in the middle of the trial. Villena replaced Victorino. Who are Manahan, Villena, and Fajardo? Here’s what we know: Manahan joined the CTA as associate justice on December 16, 2016. Manahan obtained both her undergraduate degree in political science and law degree from the University of the Philippines (UP), where she also taught part-time. She also holds a graduate degree in business administration from the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU). Manahan, who joined the Bar in 1985, has more than three decades of experience as a tax lawyer and has worked in private practice, including the law offices of Romulo Mabanta Buenaventura Sayoc & De Los Angeles and companies like Isla Lipana & Co. Manahan’s stint at the CTA is not her first foray into government service. Prior to being appointed CTA justice, Manahan served as chief legislative officer under the office of Senator Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, according to her profile on the court’s website. She worked at various government agencies such as the Department of Finance and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), and was a consultant who helped establish the international audit office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Manahan, considered a tax expert, has authored several law books centered on taxation. She wrote a column in BusinessWorld for at least seven years. She also served as president of the Tax Management Association of the Philippines, was a member of the committee on taxation under the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and was a member of the Revenue National Accreditation Board as appointed by the BIR. Villena joined the CTA as associate justice in July 2019. She was one of the youngest justices appointed to the tax court, according to her profile on the CTA’s website. She obtained her undergraduate degree in journalism from UP and her law degree from Arellano University. Villena, who was admitted to the Bar in 2001, had almost two decades of judicial experience prior to joining the CTA in 2019, including seven years as law clerk in the Supreme Court, working under SC associate justices Jose Vitug and Renato Corona, and 11 years as trial court judge. She headed Branch 6 of the Manila Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) for four years beginning in March 2008, before becoming presiding judge of Branch 28 of the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) in 2012. According to her CTA profile, Villena “maintained one of the lowest case dockets” in the MeTC and RTC. She has also received several awards, including being named as one of the most outstanding RTC judges in Manila in 2016 and outstanding first level court in Manila in 2011. Aside from government service, Villena has been teaching in law schools since 2001, focusing on criminal procedure, public international law, and insurance law, among others. Fajardo joined the CTA in May 2021. She obtained her undergraduate degree in psychology from UP and her law degree from ADMU, where she finished 14th in class. Prior to joining the tax court in 2021, Fajardo ran her own law firm that she established in 2008, according to her curriculum vitae uploaded on the Tourism Board of the Philippines website. She worked for almost seven years under two law firms – Castillo Laman Tan Pantaleon & San Jose and the Medialdea Ata Bello & Guevarra law offices – after passing the Bar in 2000. Fajardo also served as associate dean of Philippine Christian University’s College of Law. She taught in several universities, including the law schools of New Era University and Centro Escolar University. She is affiliated with the ASEAN Law Association and International Bar Association, among others. – Rappler.com As we celebrate the triumph of facts over politics, we want to thank you, our readers, for holding the line with us through the years.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/nobel-peace-prize-winners-urge-marcos-jr-ensure-justice-maria-ressa/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – Eleven Nobel Peace Prize winners urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to ensure justice and a fair trial for Rappler chief executive officer Maria Ressa, their fellow Nobel laureate, who faces several charges that may land her in jail for a lifetime. The Nobel Peace Prize laureates said in a letter released to media on Tuesday, January 17, that Ressa has been subjected to a “vicious and widespread campaign of hate and even threats on her life on social media, particularly on Facebook.” “Such campaigns have become far too common on social media, and have become dangerous tools to provoke violence and weaken democracy,” they said. Ressa has faced criminal charges for alleged tax evasion, violation of the anti-dummy law, and cyber libel, which she, Rappler, and her supporters believe to be politically motivated. They were all filed during the previous administration under Rodrigo Duterte. “We hope to see the Philippines leave the mistakes of its past behind. We ask you to assist in bringing about a rapid resolution to the unjust charges against Maria Ressa and Rappler,” the Nobel laureates said. The following were signatories of the open letter: On Wednesday, January 18, a day after the Nobel laureates’ letter was released, the Court of Tax Appeals acquitted Ressa and Rappler of tax evasion charges. After the acquittal, Ressa said that there was still more work to do. “Thank you, Court of Tax Appeals, our shareholders who stood by us during the darkest times – and were themselves harassed, our partners who stuck their necks out, and for all Filipinos who believe in the values that keep a vibrant democracy alive,” she said. In their open letter to Marcos, the laureates said they supported Marcos in his goal to unite and heal the nation, as well as his efforts to bring peace and prosperity to the Philippines. “It is our hope that your plans will include strengthening one of the bedrocks of global democracy, a free and independent press. The free media, increasingly under threat by autocrats and would-be autocrats, is rightfully fiercely protected by democracies across the globe,” they said. The laureates reminded Marcos that Ressa has become the international face of the free press in the Philippines. Her credentials also brought her international recognition even before she co-founded Rappler. “She is an asset to the nation, and an inspiration to her fellow journalists and democracy builders around the world,” they said. But, at home, apart from the “vicious and widespread campaign of hate,” the Nobel winners said that Ressa’s arrests, indictments, and possible prison sentences were “political persecution.” One of Ressa’s charges for cyber libel, they said, “[opened] the door to unchecked harassment and imprisonment by government officials of journalists, columnists, and virtually any online critics of the Philippine government.” The laureates appealed to Marcos to ensure justice for Ressa, and to initiate negotiations to clarify Rappler’s issues as a company. “The welcome result would be a strengthening of the rule of law and a rebirth of respect for the fundamental pillars of democracy in the Philippines,” they said. Ressa and Muratov won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 “for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace.” Read the full open letter here. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/about/ways-support-after-acquittal-tax-evasion-case/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – On Wednesday, January 18, the Court of Tax Appeals acquitted Rappler Holdings Corporation and Maria Ressa of tax evasion charges filed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in 2018, under the Duterte government. The court dismissed the BIR’s findings that we profited from raising capital. It was, after all, a novel case where the BIR singled out Rappler and prosecuted it for raising capital via Philippine Depositary Receipts which other media companies, such as ABS-CBN and GMA Network, had tapped for the same purpose.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-staged-engineer-testimony/,[],"A 2016 video that Tesla used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer. The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.” But the Model X was not driving itself with technology Tesla had deployed, Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, said in the transcript of a July deposition taken as evidence in a lawsuit against Tesla for a 2018 fatal crash involving a former Apple engineer. The previously unreported testimony by Elluswamy represents the first time a Tesla employee has confirmed and detailed how the video was produced. The video carries a tagline saying: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.” Elluswamy said Tesla’s Autopilot team set out to engineer and record a “demonstration of the system’s capabilities” at the request of Musk. Elluswamy, Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot. The Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features “do not make the vehicle autonomous,” the company says on its website. To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said. Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said. “The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters. When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.” Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems. The US Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported. The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources. When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, “It does not.” Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. Andrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Huang’s wife and who questioned Elluswamy’s in July, told Reuters it was “obviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk.” The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Huang’s fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla’s “ineffective monitoring of driver engagement” had contributed to the crash. Elluswamy said drivers could “fool the system,” making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not. But he said he saw no safety issue with Autopilot if drivers were paying attention. – Rappler.com"

Ngunit tatlong araw lamang ang nakalipas – at kahit wala pang naisusumiteng papeles ang RHC – inanunsiyo ng BIR sa website nito na nagsampa ito ng tax evasion complaint laban sa RHC. Nobyembre 2018, kahit pahapyaw lang nilang natingnan ang mga rekord ng RHC, nagsampa laban dito ng mga kasong kriminal sa CTA ang BIR at ang Department of Justice (DOJ).

The Museum of Cinema in Turin said it handed the prize in recognition of Spacey’s “personal aesthetic and authorial contribution to the development of the art of drama.” For the occasion, the 63-year-old was invited to speak at the museum. “I am surely blessed and grateful and humbled and my heart is very full tonight toward the Museum of Cinema for having had le palle (the guts) to invite me tonight,” he said. Spacey won Oscars for performances in American Beauty and The Usual Suspects, but his career largely ended a few years ago, after more than 20 men accused him of sexual misconduct. In the run-up to the award ceremony, the Turin-based La Stampa newspaper ran an editorial headlined “Italy, land of plenary indulgence”. Last week, Spacey appeared by video link before a court in London, pleading not guilty to several charges of sexual misconduct against one man about 20 years ago. The charges were joined to an earlier five-count indictment related to alleged sex offences against three men between 2005 and 2013, for which Spacey previously professed his innocence. In another case that played out in the United States, Spacey defeated in October a sexual abuse claim brought against him by actor Anthony Rapp. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/pacific-island-nations-urge-japan-delay-release-fukushima-waste-contamination-fears/,[],"SYDNEY, Australia – Pacific island nations are urging Japan to delay the release of water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant over fears fisheries will be contaminated, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) said on Wednesday, January 18. The Japanese government said last week that water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant could be released into the sea “around this spring or summer,” raising concerns from island nations still grappling with the legacy of nuclear testing decades ago. Japan had approved the future release of more than 1 million tons of water from the site into the ocean after treatment in April 2021. The PIF, a regional bloc of 17 island nations, argues the release of the water could have a major impact on fishing grounds that island economies rely on, and where up to half of the world’s tuna is sourced. “Our region is steadfast that there be no discharge until all parties verify it is safe,” PIF Secretary General Henry Puna said on Wednesday at a livestreamed public meeting in Suva, Fiji. “We must prevent action that will lead or mislead us towards another major nuclear contamination disaster at the hands of others,” he added, saying Pacific islanders continued to endure the long-term impacts of the nuclear testing legacy on a daily basis. The United States conducted nuclear testing in the Pacific islands in the 1940s and 1950s and the Marshall Islands continues to campaign for more compensation from Washington over lasting health and environmental effects. France conducted atomic testing between 1966 and 1996 at Mururoa Atoll in French Pacific territories. Ken Buesseler, a scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, told the forum on Wednesday that a PIF scientific expert panel was urging Japan to reconsider the waste release because it was not supported by data and more information was needed. Radioctivity moves across the ocean with currents and tides and risks contaminating fish, he said. Japan’s foreign ministry has previously said that regulators deemed it safe to release the water, which would be filtered to remove most isotopes but would still contain traces of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen hard to separate from water. – Rappler.com"

It’s a ray of sunshine, hope – for those like journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, who begins her fourth year in prison in February and Leila de Lima, who begins her seventh year in prison in February as well. I had a good feeling about today – not only because not one shred of evidence supporting these charges was presented in court – but also because of the way Justice Catherine Manahan ran the trial. She was tough. When I testified, she was joined by Justice Bacorro-Villena. But of course, we’ve lived in the upside down so long that I was prepared for the worst. So thank you, thank you, Court of Tax Appeals, our shareholders who stood by us during the darkest times – and were themselves harassed, our partners who stuck their necks out, and for all Filipinos who believe in the values that keep a vibrant democracy alive. We have a lot more work ahead! – Rappler.com"

On Wednesday, January 18, the 1st Division of the Philippine Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) acquitted Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC) of the tax evasion charges filed by the past Duterte government. We thank the court for this just decision and for recognizing that the fraudulent, false, and flimsy charges made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) do not have any basis in fact. An adverse decision would have had far-reaching repercussions on both the press and the capital markets. A politicized BIR under the Duterte administration deliberately ignored evidence that ran counter to its false conclusions that Rappler Holdings was a dealer in securities, made a profit from raising capital, and failed to pay the proper taxes from these supposed earnings. The BIR began a lightning tax probe into RHC and Ressa in January 2018, sought documents on March 5, 2018, and after three days published a press release on its website announcing its tax evasion complaint against them. This, in the absence of any documents submitted by Rappler. By November of the same year, even without a physical and thorough examination of RHC’s books and records, the BIR and the Department of Justice (DOJ) caused the filing of criminal cases at the CTA. This is brazen harassment and abuse of power. How many more companies, businesses, and even private individuals have been subjected to this kind of harassment and unethical conduct of government officials and agencies? How many have been victimized and what recourse do they have? The CTA saw through the shenanigans and decided against the BIR and the DOJ. We welcome the professionalism and the sense of justice and fairness that marked the court’s decision. Rappler will continue to dream big and explore what technology can offer. This is what fired our vision when RHC sought to increase capital and grow the business through Philippine Depositary Receipts in 2015. We believed then, as we do now, that journalism, technology, and empowered communities will be the guardrails of any democracy. Maria Ressa and RHC may have won today. But so did the ordinary taxpayer and businessman being unjustly harassed by the BIR. With you, we will continue to #HoldTheLine. – Rappler.com As we celebrate the triumph of facts over politics, we want to thank you, our readers, for holding the line with us through the years.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-gen-z-poses-challenge-xi-jinping-post-covid/,[],"SHANGHAI, China – The first weekend after COVID-19 restrictions ended in December, dozens of young Chinese jostled in the dark at a heavy-metal concert in a tiny Shanghai music venue that reeked of sweat and hard liquor. It was the kind of freedom young Chinese had demanded in late November in protests against the zero-COVID policy that became the biggest outpouring of public anger in mainland China since President Xi Jinping took power a decade ago. After three years of lockdowns, testing, economic hardship, and isolation, many of China’s Generation Z – the 280 million born between 1995 and 2010 – had found a new political voice, repudiating their stereotypes as either nationalist keyboard warriors or apolitical loafers. Pacifying a generation faced with near-record youth unemployment and some of the slowest economic growth in nearly half a century presents a policymaking challenge for Xi, who is just beginning a precedent-breaking third term. Improving young people’s livelihoods without abandoning the country’s export-led growth model poses inherent conflicts for a government that prioritises social stability. This generation is the most pessimistic of all age groups in China, surveys show. While the protests succeeded in hastening the end of COVID curbs, the hurdles Chinese youth face in achieving better living standards will be harder to overcome, some analysts say. “As the road ahead for the youth gets narrower and tougher, their hopes for the future evaporate,” said Wu Qiang, a former politics lecturer at Tsinghua University who is now an independent commentator in Beijing. Young people no longer had “blind confidence and adulation” towards China’s leaders, he added. Some Chinese youth who spoke to Reuters reflected the sense of frustration. “If they didn’t change the policy, then more people would protest, so they had to change,” said 26-year-old Alex, who declined to give her last name for fear of retribution from the authorities, in an interview before the Shanghai concert. “But I don’t think young people will go back to thinking that nothing bad ever happens in China.” Young people, especially in cities, are often at the forefront of protests globally; students led China’s biggest pro-democracy uprising in 1989, which Beijing crushed in a military crackdown. But China’s Gen Z has its own characteristics that present a dilemma for Xi, some analysts said. In recent years, some young Chinese social media users have drawn international attention for their ferocity in attacking critical views about China online, including of Beijing’s COVID policies. They became known as “little pinks,” a term associated with the color of a nationalist website, and drew comparisons with China’s aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomats and the Red Guards of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. With the economy slowing under the weight of pandemic restrictions, a countertrend emerged, but not quite of the liberal type that pushes against growing nationalism in the West. Many young Chinese have been choosing to “lie flat,” a term used to describe people who have rejected the corporate rat race by adopting a minimalist lifestyle and doing just enough to get by. There is no data on how many Chinese are inclined towards those perspectives. Brewing under the surface before the protests, however, was one unifying factor: growing discontent with their perceived economic prospects. A survey of 4,000 Chinese by consultancy Oliver Wyman found Gen Z to be the most negative about China’s economic outlook of all the age groups. Their peers in the United States, by contrast, are more optimistic than most preceding generations, according to a study by McKinsey. Some 62% of China’s Gen Z worried about job security and 56% worried about prospects for a better lifestyle, far more than older generations, according to the Wyman survey conducted in October and released in December. In the United States, the study released in October showed 45% of 18-to-24-year-olds worried about job stability, but scored better on McKinsey’s gauge of perceptions of future economic opportunities than all groups except those aged 25-34. Earlier in the Xi era, things were looking brighter. In 2015, a Pew Research Center study found seven in 10 of Chinese people born in the late 1980s felt positively about their economic situation. A whopping 96% felt their living standard was better than their parents’ at the same age. “It’s educated pessimism. It’s based on the facts and the reality that they’re witnessing,” said Zak Dychtwald, founder of research firm Young China Group, which examines trends among Chinese youth, of the mood among young adults. “I don’t think these protests would have happened ten years ago, but this young generation believes they ought to be heard in a way that older generations didn’t.” He said further unrest appeared unlikely in the near term, but the ruling Communist Party was under pressure to offer “some hope and direction” to the country’s youth at an annual legislative meeting in March. Failure to deliver such solutions could reignite protests in the long term, he said. In a New Year speech, Xi acknowledged the need to improve the prospects of China’s youth, without mentioning the protests against his zero-COVID approach. “A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive,” Xi said, without elaborating on potential policies. For China’s stability-obsessed Communist Party, giving Gen Z more political agency is unthinkable. Instead, analysts say Chinese policymakers need to create well-paid jobs for young people and ensure they thrive economically, like their parents’ generation, who accepted limited freedoms in exchange for promised prosperity. But achieving that is harder in a slower economy, and some of the policies that could improve living standards for younger Chinese are in conflict with other priorities for the world’s second-largest economy: ensuring the engines behind its 15-fold expansion over the past two decades keep running, some political analysts and economists say. Meeting Gen Z’s expectations for higher wages would make Chinese exports less competitive. Making housing more affordable could mean allowing a sector responsible for a quarter of China’s economic activity in recent years to collapse. Xi’s second-term crackdown on tech and other private sector industries has also led to job losses and fewer opportunities for young people. For all the government’s talk about “common prosperity”, levelling the playing field for this new generation seems impossible, said Fang Xu, an urban sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Their parents were able to accumulate such a massive amount of wealth from the housing market, from private entrepreneurship, and that leap is not likely to be repeated,” Fang said. “Levelling the playing field means devaluing the property market enough that it’s not impossible for young people to buy a house, but that would be a huge blow to older generations.” Given the risk of arrest, most of those who took part in the protests against COVID restrictions are laying low. It is unclear what their hopes and plans are or how they vary. But some young people feel driven to pursue their ambitions elsewhere. University student Deng, 19, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of partial anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, has little hope that she will be able to thrive in China. “If I want to stay in China, I have these two choices: stay in Shanghai to work and take an average office job or listen to my parents, return to my hometown, take the public servant exam, lie flat,” said Deng, adding she planned to emigrate instead. Data from internet giant Baidu shows online searches for studying abroad were five times the 2021 average during the two-month lockdown of Shanghai’s 25 million residents last year. Another spike occurred during the November protests. Neither Deng nor Alex see much room for further dissent in the near future. “You can either accept the system or leave China. You can’t change the system here, the authorities are too powerful,” Alex said. A few days later, at the Shanghai venue, Alex found a vantage point among fellow metal fans for the first time since COVID rules eased. She took in the sounds of the band, Rat King, her concerns for the future put aside for one night. – Rappler.com"

The regional governor said 29 people were also hurt, including 15 children, when the helicopter came down in a residential area in Brovary, on the capital’s northeastern outskirts. Several dead bodies draped in foil blankets lay in a courtyard near the damaged nursery. Emergency workers were at the scene. Debris was scattered over a playground. National police chief Ihor Klymenko said Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi had been killed alongside his first deputy, Yevheniy Yenin, and other officials in a helicopter belonging to the state emergency service. “There were children and…staff in the nursery at the time of this tragedy,” Kyiv region governor Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on Telegram. Officials did not give an immediate explanation of the cause of the helicopter crash. There was no immediate comment from Russia, whose troops invaded Ukraine last February, and Ukrainian officials made no reference to any Russian attack in the area at the time. Monastyrskyi, responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine, would be the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. Separately, Ukraine reported intense fighting overnight in the east of the country, where both sides have taken huge losses for little gain in intense trench warfare over the last two months. Ukrainian forces repelled attacks in the eastern city of Bakhmut and the village of Klishchiivka just south of it, the Ukrainian military said. Russia has focused on Bakhmut in recent weeks, claiming last week to have taken the mining town of Soledar on its northern outskirts. After major Ukrainian gains in the second half of 2022, the frontlines have hardened over the last two months. Kyiv says it hopes new Western weapons would allow it to resume an offensive to recapture land, especially heavy tanks which would give its troops mobility and protection to push through Russian lines. Western allies will be gathering on Friday at a US air base in Germany to pledge more weapons for Ukraine. Attention is focused in particular on Germany, which has veto power over any decision to send its Leopard tanks, which are fielded by armies across Europe and widely seen as the most suitable for Ukraine. Berlin says a decision on the tanks will be the first item on the agenda of Boris Pistorius, its new defense minister. Britain, which broke the Western taboo on sending main battle tanks over the weekend by promising a squadron of its Challengers, has called on Germany to approve the Leopards. Poland and Finland have already said they would be ready to send Leopards if Berlin allows it. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/republican-told-gunmen-aim-lower-attacks-new-mexico-democrats/,[],"A failed Republican candidate in New Mexico was charged on Tuesday with contracting four gunmen to shoot at the homes of Democratic officials after he visited them to dispute his 2022 election defeat. Solomon Pena, who lost a November state House of Representatives race, faces at least a dozen charges for masterminding Albuquerque drive-by shootings on residences of two county commissioners and two state legislators since December 4, according to the county prosecutor’s office. Pena, described as a “radical right election denier” by Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, was arrested on Monday, January 17. No one was hurt in the shootings, which followed sometimes heated arguments as Pena visited the homes of three county commissioners and state Senator Linda Lopez to allege fraud in a House race he lost by 47 percentage points, police said. In the final attack on the home of Lopez on January 3, the legislator’s 10-year-old daughter was awoken and felt dust fall on her face as bullets hit her bedroom ceiling, a criminal complaint said. Pena was annoyed no one was hit in previous attacks and told gunmen to carry out the shooting, which he took part in, earlier in the evening, according to the filing. “Solomon wanted them to aim lower and shoot around 8 pm because occupants would more likely not be laying down,” the complaint said, citing an unnamed source. Police said a person involved in the conspiracy is cooperating with investigators. At least two gunmen are in custody. Pena, who has previously been convicted of felonies such as burglary, faces a 1 p.m. pre-trial detention hearing on Wednesday. It was not immediately possible to identify lawyers representing suspects in the case. Pena on November 15 tweeted a photo of himself wearing a “Make America Great Again” sweatshirt and a message saying “researching my options” as he was not conceding his election. Pena is a supporter of false theories spread by prominent New Mexico-based election denier David Clements, according to Pena’s website and messages in a Telegram group run by Clements’ wife. “Hang them until dead!” Pena wrote in July in the New Mexico Audit Force Telegram group in response to a claim of fraud in Nevada. “They helped overthrow Donald J. Trump.” Clements, an evangelist for myths about rigged voting machines, did not immediately respond to a request for information about his links to Pena. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/greta-thunberg-released-brief-detention-german-mine-protest/,[],"LUETZERATH, Germany – Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg was detained alongside other activists on Tuesday, January 17, during protests against the demolition of a village to make way for a coal mine expansion but was released after an identity check, according to police. Thunberg was held while protesting at the opencast coal mine of Garzweiler 2, some 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from the village of Luetzerath, after police warned that the group would be removed by force if they did not move away from the edge of the mine. The village in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia is being cleared to allow for the expansion of the mine. The mine’s owner, RWE, agreed with the government that it could demolish Luetzerath in exchange for its faster exit from coal and the saving of five villages originally slated for destruction. Activists have said Germany should not be mining any more lignite, or brown coal, and should focus on expanding renewable energy instead. Riot police backed by bulldozers removed activists from buildings in the abandoned village last week, with only a few left in trees and an underground tunnel by last weekend, but protesters including Thunberg remained at the site staging a sit-in into Tuesday. “We are going to use force to bring you to the identity check, so please cooperate,” a policeman said to the group, according to Reuters footage. “Greta Thunberg was part of a group of activists who rushed towards the ledge. However, she was then stopped and carried by us with this group out of the immediate danger area to establish their identity,” a spokesperson for Aachen police told Reuters, adding that one activist had jumped into the mine. Thunberg was carried away by three police officers and held by one arm at a spot away from the edge of the mine and was then escorted back towards police vans. The Swedish climate activist addressed the around 6,000 protesters who marched towards Luetzerath on Saturday, calling the expansion of the mine a “betrayal of present and future generations.” “Germany is one of the biggest polluters in the world and needs to be held accountable,” she said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippine-tax-court-clears-nobel-laureate-maria-ressa-rappler-of-4-cases/,['LIAN BUAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on Wednesday, January 18, acquitted Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and Rappler Holdings Corporation (RHC) of four charges of tax evasion that were filed in 2018 by the previous Duterte government. The CTA 1st Division decided to acquit Ressa and RHC, Rappler’s holding company, in the Duterte government’s charge that it evaded tax payments when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors North Base Media (NBM) and Omidyar Network (ON). This involved the issuance to the two entities of Philippine Depositary Receipts or PDRs, financial instruments commonly used even among media companies like ABS-CBN and GMA Network. In an 80-page decision, the court ordered the acquittal of Ressa and RHC for “failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” The decision was signed by Associate Justices Catherine Manahan, Jean Marie Bacorro-Villena, and Marian Ivy Reyes-Fajardo. Presiding Justice Roman del Rosario inhibited from the proceedings but certified the decision. The victory ends more than four years of trial of a case filed in March 2018, two months after the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission issued a closure order against Rappler on the basis of the Duterte government’s charge that it broke the law by being foreign-owned. Rappler is a 100% Filipino company, a point asserted by the company in its appeal of the SEC order at the Court of Appeals (CA). An emotional Ressa said after the verdict: “Today, facts win, truth wins, justice wins,” calling for freedom of detained former senator Leila de Lima and jailed journalists like Frenchie Mae Cumpio. De Lima will begin her seventh year in prison in February, while Cumpio will begin her fourth year also in February. The CTA voted 3-0 to decide the “non-taxability of the issuance of PDRs to North Base Media and Omidyar Network.” The court added, “No gain or income was realized by accused in the subject transactions. “Since accused is not required to pay the income tax and VAT on the PDR transactions for the taxable year 2015, the elements of Sections 254 and 255 of the 1977 NIRC as amended, are rendered nugatory and without legal support. The plaintiff therefore failed to prove the guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubt,” said the CTA decision. The CTA also said, “There is nothing in the wordings of the PDR instruments and the PDR subscription agreements that would show the foreign entities NBM and ON will become owners of the shares of stock of Rappler.” Ressa’s lawyer Francis Lim, the former president of the Philippine Stock Exchange, said that if PDRs were declared to be taxable income just to convict Ressa and Rappler, every business seeking to raise capital would be affected. “At the end of the day, it’s our economy, it’s our people through job generation that will benefit. Imagine if Maria was convicted, the repercussions,” said Lim. Lim also said: “We had no doubt this day would come. I told them keep the faith, because in our hearts we knew an acquittal would come. We trust our judiciary, everybody knew where this case came from.” It was former Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) commissioner Caesar Dulay, a Duterte appointee, who initiated the lightning tax probe into Rappler on January 24, 2018; he filed the criminal complaints two months later, in March, before the justice department then headed by Menardo Guevarra, another Duterte appointee. Guevarra charged Ressa and RHC at the CTA in November 2018. The CTA’s acquittal of RHC and Ressa is expected to affect a related case that was filed by the Duterte government against the two before the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, which handles tax cases involving less than P1 million. Rappler is about to wrap up its presentation of evidence for that case; the facts are identical to the four charges that the CTA junked on Wednesday. In general, an acquittal cannot be appealed because of the right against double jeopardy. With the junking of the four CTA cases, there remain only three active court cases against Rappler and Ressa: the appeal of Ressa and former researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. in their conviction for cyber libel pending at the Supreme Court, the lone tax case at the Pasig City RTC, and the appeal on the closure of Rappler pending at the CA. The mother case, the SEC’s closure order that is pending at the appeals court, accuses Rappler of violating the constitutional requirement that Filipino media companies must be 100% Filipino-owned. The alleged violation was supposedly committed when it issued PDRs to foreign investor ON. The court previously said that Rappler was entitled to a curing period, and that ON’s donation of the PDRs to Filipino managers had removed the problem. But the SEC in the last two days of the Duterte term in June 2022, stood firm on its order to close down Rappler – triggering another round of litigation at the appellate court which is still ongoing. In the CTA cases, Rappler’s lawyers said that in the last 20 years, the BIR has treated PDRs as derivatives of stock for which only documentary stamp tax was due to be paid. “This case exemplifies how the power of taxation can be used as a tool to cause a thousand cuts to our democracy. Rappler Inc., which has been at the forefront of providing independent journalism in the Philippines, caught the ire of the Duterte Government. As a result, and for the first time in Philippine history, the BIR classified a holding company that issued PDRs as a dealer in securities and required the payment of income tax and VAT,” Rappler and Ressa said in a final memorandum submitted to the CTA before the judgment on Wednesday. “The Government’s targeted attack and investigations against Rappler, Inc.’s parent company, Accused Rappler Holdings Corporation and RHC’s President Maria Ressa, presents a clear example of how the law can be bent to the point that it is broken,” said Rappler’s memorandum. – Rappler.com"

Some $323 million in crypto had been hacked from FTX’s international exchange and $90 million had been hacked from its US exchange since it filed for bankruptcy on November 11, CEO John Ray said in a separate statement on Tuesday. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been accused of stealing billions of dollars from FTX customers to pay debts incurred by his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges. FTX told a bankruptcy judge in Delaware last week that it had recovered over $5 billion in crypto, cash and liquid securities, nine weeks after declaring bankruptcy. The company provided additional details on Tuesday, saying it had recovered $1.7 billion in cash, $3.5 billion in liquid cryptocurrency and $300 million in liquid securities. FTX did not provide an estimate of total liabilities, but said it had identified important significant shortfalls at both its international and US crypto exchanges. “We are making progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,” Ray said in the statement. The crypto assets recovered to date include $685 million in Solana, $529 million in FTX’s proprietary FTT token and $268 million in bitcoin, based on crypto prices on November 11, 2022. Solana, which was lauded by Bankman-Fried, lost most of its value in 2022. During FTX’s initial investigation into hacks of its system, it uncovered a November asset seizure by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, which led to a dispute between FTX’s US-based bankruptcy team and Bahamian regulators. The two sides settled their differences in January, and Ray said on Tuesday that the Bahamian government was holding $426 million for creditors. Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis referenced the dispute during a Tuesday event at the Atlantic Council in Washington, saying that Ray’s team had “come around” and accepted that the Bahamian asset seizure “was appropriate and perhaps has saved the day for many of the investors in FTX.” – Rappler.com"

The roll-out of the devices using Apple’s latest versions of the M2 chip, which it debuted last year, is an outgrowth of the tech giant’s decision in 2020 to use semiconductors designed in-house after 15 years of relying on Intel’s technology. The new Mac mini starts at $599 and will be available from January 24. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the latest chips start at $1,999, compared with the $1,299 price tag for a 13-inch model fitted with the M2 chip. The new Macbook Pro models were expected for months, but supply-chain issues meant the launch was delayed from last year to early 2023, Bloomberg News reported in October. “This is all connected to the delayed chipset transition… With it being delayed, Apple has been faced with the questions to wait for the traditional, expected launch or actually do something a bit unexpected,” said Canalys analyst Runar Bjørhovde. “This is a great way of throwing things around and surprising the consumers and competitors,” Bjørhovde said, adding that the announcement could generate some hype at a time when the broader personal computer market is in a slump. Shares of Apple rose about 1%, outperforming a broadly weaker market. The stock lost about 27% in 2022, its biggest fall since the 2008 financial crisis. Apple said the new M2 Pro has nearly 20% more transistors than the M1 Pro and double the amount in M2, helping programs like Adobe Photoshop run heavy workloads “faster than ever.” The company, which gets its chips manufactured by Taiwan’s TSMC, replaced chipmaker Nvidia as one of the top ten semiconductor vendors by revenue last year, according to a Gartner report on Tuesday. “We estimate that the value of these (Apple) chips is equivalent to $17.6 billion in 2022. The growth coming from increased cost of ever more complex chips,” said Andrew Norwood, VP Analyst at Gartner.

Ang totoong pinag-usapan: Walang binanggit sa pagdinig sa Senado noong Enero 16, 2023, na kahit na ano tungkol sa last will and testament ni Marcos. Ang naganap sa Senado ay ang pagdinig ng Committee on Agriculture, Food, and Agrarian Reform ukol sa mataas na presyo ng sibuyas. Walang nabanggit ang sinuman sa buong pagdinig na kahit na ano tungkol kay Marcos at sa kanyang last will and testament. Makikita rin sa Facebook page ng Senado ang mga buod ng mga sinabi nina Senador Cynthia Villar, Imee Marcos, Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito, Grace Poe, Raffy Tulfo, Nancy Binay, at Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel. Walang binanggit na kahit na ano ang mga senador tungkol sa dating pangulong Marcos.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/doj-junks-murder-complaint-cops-labor-leader-death-bloody-sunday/,['JAIRO BOLLEDO'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) panel of prosecutors dismissed the murder complaint filed against cops tagged in the killing of a labor leader during the “Bloody Sunday” operations in 2021. In a 23-page decision dated October 5, 2022, the prosecutors dismissed the murder complaint for “insuffiency of evidence” in relation to death of Emmanuel “Manny” Asuncion on March 7, 2021. His wife, Liezel, filed the complaint. Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Rodan Parrocha and Assistant State Prosecutor Moises Yao Acayan signed the resolution. Among the named respondents were the following personnel of the Philippine National Police: The prosecutors also ordered the records to be returned to the National Bureau of Investigation “for the conduct of further investigation to determine the identities of the assailants.” During the simultaneous operations against progressive individuals in March 2021, Asuncion was killed in Cavite. He was the secretary general of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in his province, and a known labor leader and mass organizer in the Southern Luzon. (READ: Labor activists after leaders’ killing: Hope is what’s left for us) At least nine activists were killed, while six others were arrested during the so-called “Bloody Sunday” operations conducted in different locations. The search warrant, issued by Manila First Vice Executive Judge Jose Lorenzo dela Rosa, covered Asuncion and his residence in Rosario, Cavite, where he allegedly possessed a .45 caliber pistol and ammunitions. But, the labor leader was killed in Dasmariñas City – roughly one hour away from where he was slain. Then-justice department, led by now Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, moved to sue the cops involved in Asuncion’s death through the Administrative Order No. 35. The order created the panel to probe politically-motivated killings. Now, under DOJ Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla, the complaint has been dismissed. Meanwhile, the NBI had previously filed complaints against 17 cops who had “deliberate intent to kill” activists Ariel Evangelista and Ana Mariz “Chai” Lemita-Evangelista in Nasugbu, Batangas also during that “Bloody Sunday” on March 2021. The complaint is still pending before the DOJ. In its resolution, the panel of prosecutors said the circumstances presented by the complainant were “insufficient” to establish that the cops committed the crime of murder against Asuncion. “Applying the foregoing in the present case, the undersigned panel finds that the circumstances presented by complainant in support of its accusation against the respondents are insufficient to establish probable cause for the crime of Murder as the complainant Asuncion failed to adequately substantiate her allegations against all the respondents.” The prosecutors noted that although Liezel said she can identify more or less six of the cops, “she did not directly and categorically identify them.” They added that Asuncion’s wife also failed to identify the respective participation of each cop in the alleged crime. “A perusal of complainant Liezel Asuncion’s complaint-affidavit shows that she was not able to establish the identity/ies of the assailant/s. Although she identified the group of people who entered their house to be police officers, nevertheless, she was not able to see their faces…” The resolution also noted that Asuncion’s wife said she was not able to see who shot her husband “because she was already outside the house when she heard the gunshots.” The prosecutors said that there was no eyewitness to the crime, adding that “there was also nothing that directly incriminates the respondents in killing him.” “To reiterate, all that was presented by complainant were circumstantial evidence that does not show an unbroken chain that leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the probability that respondents committed the offense,” the resolution read. On the service of the warrant, the prosecutors claimed that there is evidence proving that implementation of the warrants was legitimate, and that Asuncion “resisted.” First, the prosecutors said the gunpowder nitrates found in Asuncion’s hands proves “the assertions of the respondents that he (Asuncion) fired upon them.” Second, the bullet holes found in the staircase landing wall correlated with the autopsy report stating that Asuncion sustained gunshot wounds in his chest. According to the prosecutors, this proved the cops “made defensive shots from the ground floor” when the slain activist allegedly fired at them from the second floor.  – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/pakistan-prime-minister-conditional-talks-offer-arch-rival-india/,[],"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has made a conditional offer to his Indian
counterpart to open talks on all outstanding issues between them, including disputed Kashmir, which he believes could be facilitated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). “My message to the Indian leadership and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is let’s sit down at the table and have serious and sincere talks to resolve our burning issues, like Kashmir,” Sharif said in an interview with Al Arabiya news channel, telecast by Pakistan’s state run TV on Tuesday, January 17. However, a statement issued by Sharif’s office after the interview aired added that such talks would only be possible if India restored the autonomous status in the part of Kashmir it rules that was revoked in 2019. “Without India’s revocation of this step, negotiations are not possible,” it said. The Indian foreign affairs ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. New Delhi has ignored such calls from Pakistan on Kashmir’s status in the past. In the interview, Sharif said he had taken up the issue with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed on his recent visit to the Emirates. “He’s a brother of Pakistan. He also has good relations with India. He can play a very important role to bring the two countries on the talking table,” Sharif said. The two arch-rival nuclear powers have fought three wars since independence from British rule in 1947. Two of the wars were over Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region, which both the nations claim. Each controls half of the region. The two neighbors came close to war again in 2019, when India launched an air strike inside Pakistan to target what New Delhi said was a militant training facility. Tensions were again inflamed when India unilaterally revoked the autonomous status of its part of Kashmir later in 2019, which Sharif said resulted in “flagrant” human rights violations. India has faced a decades-long insurgency in its part of Kashmir which is accuses Pakistan of stoking – an accusation Islamabad denies. Official talks between the two countries have been suspended since then, although there have been some backdoor diplomacy attempts to resume negotiations – one brokered by the UAE in 2021. Sharif said the wars between the two countries brought nothing except misery, poverty and unemployment. “We want to alleviate poverty, achieve prosperity and provide education, health facilities and employment to our people, and not waste our resources on bombs and ammunition, that’s the message I want to give to PM Modi,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/bpi-sees-boost-gokongwei-network-robinsons-bank-merger/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Bank of the Philippine Islands and Robinsons Bank Corporation are set to merge by January 1, 2024, with BPI as the surviving entity. In a special stockholders’ meeting on Tuesday, January 17, BPI stockholders with shares representing 79.63% of total outstanding shares voted to approve the proposed merger between the Ayala-led lender and Robinsons Bank. BPI plans to absorb the Gokongwei-led bank, subject to regulatory approvals from the Philippine Competition Commission, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and Securities and Exchange Commission. The merger will immediately boost BPI’s position, according to the bank’s president and chief executive officer Jose Teodoro “TG” Limcaoco. “Robinsons Bank is expected to expand BPI’s key balance sheet metrics by between 6.5% [and] maybe 7%,” he said. “We believe that this merger will immediately improve BPI’s industry ranking in deposits to second from third.” Limcaoco added that the merger would “unlock synergies” across their products and platforms, citing the Gokongwei group’s empire, which includes food manufacturing, air transportation, real estate, property development, and retail. “The merger will also expand BPI’s access to the network of the Gokongwei group, especially to the Filipino-Chinese market segment, which has been the significant advantage of our closest competitors,” he said. Once the merger is complete, all Robinsons Bank branches will be converted into BPI branches. But some branches may be closed down following a post-merger rationalization study, taking into account their location and BPI’s increasing digitalization. Despite the possible shutdown of some branches, Limcaoco gave assurances that no layoffs are coming. “Our plan is that the merger should not result in any layoffs on either side. They have an excellent workforce. We believe there is room for everyone in a merger,” he said. Although the target date for the merger to take effect is January 1, 2024, it may happen as early as October 1, 2023, depending on when regulatory bodies give their approval.

Shamcey, who finished as third runner-up in Miss Universe 2011, had nothing but good words for Celeste. “You fought bravely to raise the Filipino flag on that stage and what truly matters is that you gave it your all and made your country proud,” she told the Filipino-Italian beauty queen. Shamcey continued, “This experience is truly a lesson in humility. It is a way to remind all of us to stay grounded for we are all created equal.” She also took the chance to comment that the “new era” of Miss Universe has reminded them of the “true essence of the platform”, saying that it is “breaking stereotypes and embracing diversity.” The 71st edition of the pageant is the first under new owner Anne Jakrakutatip – who declared that the pageant will now be a “global women’s empowerment platform” that will be “for all women around the world.” This, she hinted, will be part of their appraisal of the country’s next representatives in the pageant. “Our work continues to be a venue for women to find a purpose larger than themselves and to use their collective voices to create an unstoppable force for good,” she said.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-davos-world-economic-forum-what-philippines-can-expect-maharlika-fund-pitch/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – In President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s own words, his January 2023 visit to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum (WEF) won’t be too different from his previous trips abroad. This time though, he intends to sell to foreign investors and fellow world leaders the controversial sovereign wealth fund his administration is pushing. “In general, pare-pareho naman ‘yung ginagawa natin dito sa mga trips (what we do in these trips are the same). We talk about the Philippines, what the situation is as an investment destination. Now, as added to that, mayroon na tayong pwedeng pag-usapan na (we can now talk about the) sovereign wealth fund,” he told the media on board the presidential plane on the way to Zurich from Manila on Sunday, January 15. Marcos has been to eight countries, thus far, in his first seven months of office. In early September, for his first state visits as chief executive, Marcos flew to Indonesia and Singapore. Later that month, he spoke for the first time before the United Nations during its first in-person General Assembly. In November, he flew to Phnom Penh and then Bangkok for two high-level meets – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. In December, Marcos flew out for one last time to Brussels for the ASEAN-European Union Summit. In early January, he was in Beijing for a little over 48 hours for his first state visit outside of Southeast Asia. As he hops around the world, his mission – according to the President himself, the administration’s communications arm, and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) – is the same: to sell the Philippines as ready and ripe for investments. But are we? Rappler columnist and economist JC Punongbayan says that while Marcos and his economic team are right – that the Philippines and our neighbors in East Asia are likely to buck the global recession – growth isn’t looking to be any better, either. Marcos flies to Davos as Philippine inflation hits a 14-year high, driven mostly by the rising cost of goods. The President has said the problem is our dependence on imports and that improving local production is important in solving the rise in food prices. Marcos is concurrently agriculture chief, meaning keeping production in check and food prices down is primarily his job, too. According to a survey by the WEF ahead of the meeting, the following are top concerns of Davos attendees: the threat of recession, the cost-of-living crisis, mounting debt distress, and the failure to tackle climate change. This year, the WEF wants to talk about ”cooperation in a fragmented world” – a befitting theme, given one issue that hangs over all attendee’s heads: Russia’s war on Ukraine. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska is among the first and most prominent speakers on the first day of the gathering. The WEF – often referred to simply as “Davos” – is an annual gathering of business and political elite in the idyllic town of Davos in Switzerland. In 2021, the WEF was cancelled because of COVID-19 while in 2022, it was scaled-down and held in the middle of year, months after its usual winter schedule. Its goals – at least on paper – are ambitious. On its website, the WEF says its goal is “solving the biggest issues facing our world.” Filipino magnate Enrique Razon, chairman and CEO of the International Container Terminal Services (ICTS) once vented about the forum in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg. “It’s loaded with bloated self-importance… I’m here to do business, not save the world,” he said then. Razon is among the Filipino businessmen who are in Davos again for the 2023 edition. According to Reuters, WEF isn’t too far off from every other international meet. Delegates, particularly those with white badges which get greater access, listen in on panels and speeches inside the Congress Center. On the sidelines, business executives hold meetings and heads of state organize bilateral meetings, which Reuters notes takes up most of their time. Marcos, however, is not expected to hold bilateral meetings on Davos, at least according to the DFA in its briefing ahead of the President’s trip. Sure, he’s expected to mingle and meet fellow world leaders there, but these will likely be casual exchanges sans the procedure of an actual bilater,al meeting. Previous trips, save for the state visits, always included bilateral meetings in the schedule. At the Davos main promenade, shops and restaurants are rented out by companies and countries. This is where they host parties and discussions on the sidelines of the main WEF events, according to Reuters. Marcos brings with him a team of 16 official delegates, as well as his wife, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos. His delegation, as published in the manual for Philippine media in Davos include: Of the 17 in his delegation, 9 are part of the WEF’s list of “public figures” participating in the event. Information and Communications Secretary Ivan John Uy and Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo are in the WEF’s list but are not in the official delegation list. Like his previous trips abroad, Marcos is traveling with several family members who are also ranking officials in Philippine government. Speaker Romualdez is his cousin and Representative Marcos is his son. Accounts Chairperson Romualdez is the wife of the Speaker. The Presidential Communications Office (PCO), tasked with the government’s communication and messaging, has not released an official delegation list for Davos. The PCO, which was originally named the Office of the Press Secretary at the start of the Marcos admin, has never released the official delegation list of Marcos’ travels, despite repeated requests from media. The Philippines is expected to host on Tuesday, January 17 a “country strategy dialogue,” or an event where economic managers – who make up the bulk of the official delegation – will talk about their plans for the country. They’ve hosted the same sort or event on the sidelines of Marcos’ other trips. Marcos said the Philippines will touch on its plans to develop “resilient infrastructure” to reinforce supply chains and improve food security, as well as its COVID-19 plans. The President is keynote speaker for the event. The bulk of Marcos’ schedule includes meetings with fellow participants, particularly from the business sector. On January 18, Marcos will be part of a panel on “Moving Toward Nutrition Security.” The same day, he will be speaking at a dialogue on “investing in infrastructure for resilience.” As his preliminary schedule suggests, the WEF is mostly talk. In Davos, Marcos is angling to talk much about his pet sovereign wealth fund. “Sasabihin ko (I’ll talk about) exactly what’s happened that we are forming a sovereign wealth fund for investments in the… for big investments in the basic areas such as agri, energy, digitalization, climate change, ‘yun ganon pa rin. But the point being is that now there is a social – there is a wealth,” he told media. But in a gathering that will focus on the threat of recession, the rising cost of goods, and conflict like the war in Ukraine that affects supply chains and the world’s economic stability, will enough ears be listening? – Rappler.com"

It will be a good challenge for us this coming Season 86,” he said. UE’s 5-9 display in Season 85, which included two impressive victories against La Salle, was the program’s best standing in the UAAP men’s basketball tournament since the 2015 team of Season 78 finished with a 6-8 record. The Red Warriors had a shot at making the recent Final Four before a string of late-season losses eliminated them from contention. Santiago said he is “looking for at least two Fil-Ams ready to play right now” but opted not to give their names due to ongoing discussions. He also sees the Red Warriors elevating a maximum of two players from their Team B, which is currently competing in the Pinoy Liga Cup.

Why? Because luxury is relative. Discussions about privilege, wealth, and bags have dominated the social media space since 17-year-old Zoe Gabriel excitedly shared a TikTok video unboxing her “first luxury bag” — a gift from her father. The Filipina teenager did not expect people to mock her for her perceived luxury. A mean “who’s gonna tell her?” remark forced Gabriel to address the hate. “Your comment spoke volumes on how ignorant you seem because of your wealth. To you, an $80 bag may not be a luxury. But for me and my family, it is a lot,” Gabriel said. “And I’m so grateful my dad was able to get me one. He worked so hard for that money. I can’t believe I got hate over a bag I was so excited to have.” Gabriel’s reply has earned her respect on social media, with users giving encouraging words, some even offering the Singapore-based teen their own bags for handling the hate maturely, and brands reaching out to her family. Even Singaporean fast-fashion brand Charles & Kieth invited Gabriel to a tour of its headquarters and sent her customized bags as a way thanking the teen, a move that netizens felt she deserved. Gabriel’s situation strongly resonated with social media users, who shared their two cents on what common people think luxury is. “Beyond the discussion of luxury brands, is a much larger discussion about the inequality in society that fuels misunderstandings and reduced empathy, and we need to be willing to transcend beyond such misunderstandings to advocate for a fairer and more equal system that can allow greater empathy and understanding to occur,” Roy Ngerng shared. “Buying onions in the Philippines is luxury.” For Gerry Cacanindin and other users, luxury is relative. Sef noted that especially in this economy, buying anything that is not a basic need should be considered luxury. Some TikTok users also came in defense of Gabriel. “Charles & Keith is not a luxury bag, but who cares?” user leonaziyan said. “A lot of people look down on affordable products, but let me tell you, just because you have the money, just because something is expensive, doesn’t mean that it is actually classy.” CJ Reyes said he considers his trusty shoebag a luxury because of its use and convenience. “Let’s learn how to appreciate things,” he added. Faris Abdurrachman notes brands like H&M and Uniqlo feel like a luxury given their price tags. Others shared photos of their version of ‘luxury’ bags, ranging from cartoon totes, bulky backpacks, and complete knockoffs. Inspired by Gabriel’s story, others also shared their own stories of buying “luxury” items. A Twitter user pointed out the discussion goes beyond how people perceive luxury, as it also reveals the wealth disparity and attitude of some wealthy Southeast Asians. American model Wisdom Kaye and other users also noted how social media has encouraged people to hate even the most innocent of things that people share. What are your thoughts on this? – Rappler.com"

Samar province on January 17 joined Northern Samar and Eastern Samar, which had earlier approved resolutions declaring a state of calamity. The Samar state of calamity resolution said flooding had affected 214,160 individuals in 256 barangays, or 27% of the province’s population. The provincial agriculture office said more than half of 13,119 hectares of farmlands were damaged, with losses amounting to P214.2 million. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Northern Samar, in a special session, declared the province under state of calamity on Monday, January 16 on the request of the disaster council chaired by Gov. Edwin Onghuan. Eastern Samar declared a state of calamity on January 13. Officials said that with the declaration of a state of calamity, local government units can use their calamity funds to distribute aid to constituents and control the prices of basic commodities. The latest floods in Eastern Visayas were due to heavy rain from a shear line and low pressure area, a repeat of conditions in the region during the Christmas season. The RDRRMC said two persons were killed in floods and 778,422 individuals temporarily displaced, including in Leyte and Southern Leyte. In Northern Samar, PDRRM Officer Rei Josiah reported that at least 238,322 individuals or 55,789 families were heavily affected by the calamity. Six municipalities – Catubig, Las Navas, Catarman, Laoang, Mondragon and Lope de Vega – had the most number of affected individuals. Officials of Catubig had earlier placed the town under a state of calamity.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-president-phuc-quits-january-2023/,[],"HANOI, Vietnam – Vietnam President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has resigned after the ruling Communist Party blamed him for “violations and wrongdoing” by officials under his control while prime minister, the government said on Tuesday, January 17. Phuc, 68, who was premier from 2016-2021, has held the largely ceremonial position of president for less than two years and is the highest-ranking official targeted by the party’s sweeping corruption crackdown. Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four “pillars”: the powerful party’s secretary, the president, the prime minister and the chair of the legislature. “Fully being aware of his responsibilities before the party and people, he submitted an application to resign from his assigned positions, quit his job and retire,” the government said in statement, citing the party’s powerful Central Committee. Phuc’s office could not immediately be reached for comment and it was not clear if the party, which has accepted his resignation, has identified a candidate to replace him. There had been widespread speculation in recent weeks that Phuc would quit following January’s dismissals of two deputy prime ministers who had served under him, as the party doubles down on a “blazing furnace” anti-corruption drive led by the its long-serving chief, Nguyen Phu Trong. The raft of investigations and dismissals signal an intensification of the crackdown, despite concerns it is
paralyzing routine transactions as officials fear being entangled in probes. In 2022 alone, 539 party members were prosecuted or “disciplined” for corruption and “deliberate wrongdoings,” including ministers, top officials and diplomats, according to the party, while police investigated 453 corruption cases, up 50% from 2021. To become effective, Phuc’s resignation requires approval from the National Assembly. Sources with knowledge of political and parliamentary affairs on Monday told Reuters the legislature would hold a rare extraordinary meeting this week. Phuc was chosen in April 2021 to be president, and was widely tipped to succeed the party’s General Secretary, the state’s most prestigious job. He served for five years as a pro-business prime minister, overseeing a further acceleration of an economic liberalization drive that included trade deals with the European Union and Pacific powers, including Japan and Australia. Despite his downfall, the government on Tuesday praised him for his achievements. “As prime minister for the 2016-2021 term, he has made great efforts in leading, directing and administering the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, achieving important results,” it said. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/senators-call-full-time-department-agriculture-secretary-hearing-january-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Some senators are now beginning to ask whether it is about time to find a full-time agriculture secretary, as volatile onion prices now threaten to stifle the livelihoods and lives of farmers. Department of Agriculture (DA) senior officials faced the Senate on Monday, January 16, after miscalculations in onion demand and supply, late imports, unchecked smuggling, and a lack of cold storage facilities all worked to push onion prices skyrocketing to historic highs. Yet, while soaring onion prices have dominated headlines, an onion shortage is not the only problem the DA faces. Recently, prices of eggs have shot up 45%. The country is also weathering shortages in salt and sugar. As these issues surfaced during Monday’s Senate committee hearing, Senator Grace Poe asserted that it was time to have an agriculture secretary that would address the “agricultural crisis” head on. “Panahon na rin siguro talaga na magkaroon ng DA Secretary na aako sa kawalan ng action sa agricultural crisis na ito. Asukal noong una; sibuyas naman ngayon. I-hehearing ata natin lahat ng kailangan sa kusina,” she said. (It’s probably time to have a DA Secretary who will take responsibility over the lack of action in this agricultural crisis. Before it was sugar; now, it’s onions. We’ll end up having a hearing for everything in the kitchen.) President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has left the country for his eighth foreign trip in seven months, is the incumbent department secretary. Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel also agreed with the idea of looking for a new secretary. He said that the country would benefit from having an expert sit as secretary of the department, something that would not prevent Marcos from still focusing on agriculture. “There is nothing which prevents the President from making agriculture his priority, even if he has a full-time secretary,” Pimentel said in an ANC Headstart interview on Tuesday, January 17. “It has long been time. I have been calling for the need for a regular agricultural secretary to be appointed. Nothing to lose – it’s an additional expert person to help the President focus on agricultural issues and problems,” he added. Pimentel worried that leaving crucial decisions, such as when to import onions, up to lower level bureaucrats may make it more difficult to get conclusive answers for agricultural issues. Earlier in January, the DA had allowed the importation of 21,060 metric tons of onions, months after industry groups had called for the move. And while the DA defended the decision as a way to stop soaring prices, farmers’ groups claim late imports may only aggravate the situation – driving price manipulation and exploitation of onion farmers by traders. Romel Calingasan, the municipal agriculturist of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, said that any imports implemented now come far too late. He asserted that the DA should have imported onions in late 2022 to ease prices at the market while also not clashing with the local harvest season. “Dapat September pa lang, nag-issue na kayo ng importation permit para ‘yung presyo sa merkado, nagkaroon ng kalaban ‘yung local at ang imported. Pinagsamantalahan na patungan ng almost 1,000%. Tapos ngayon na mag-aani na si Juan na magsasaka, sasabayan ng importation,” Calingasan said. (You should have issued importation permits as early as September so that there would be a balance of forces between local and imported. They took advantage and marked up prices at almost 1,000%. And now that farmer Juan will be harvesting, [the government] also starts importing.) Pimentel was also astounded that the DA failed to foresee the consequences of allowing late imports. “How old is the Department of Agriculture? It’s more than a hundred years old … It should have institutional memory na the world has seasons, farming has seasons,” he said in the Headstart interview. “Alam na dapat nila that these are lean months, but the world supply is there. But they did not allow importation.” During the Senate hearing, AGAP Representative Nicanor Briones also highlighted how the recent high prices were a result of manipulation. “Mapapansin po ninyo ang anihan ng sibuyas ay January to April. Talagang minamanipula ng importer. Tiniming nila na malapit na ang anihan, nagimport sila ng marami na ibagsak ang presyo ng sibuyas,” he said. (You’ll notice that the onion harvest is from January to April. Importers are really manipulating it. They’re timing it such that they can import a lot just as the harvest starts so that the price of onions will crash.) He said that once prices fall and no new imports are allowed in, traders swoop in to take advantage. “Noong mapabagsak nila ang presyo, mamimili sila, ilalagay nila sa cold storage, hindi muna sila mag-iimport. Kaya naging P600 – P700 ang kilo ng sibuyas, dahil hawak nila ang lahat ng sibuyas. Napakalinaw na merong cartel.” (When they manage to crash prices, they’ll buy onions, place it in cold storage, and stop imports. The reason why onions reached P600 – P700 per kilo was because they hold all the onions. It’s very clear that there’s a cartel.) But even if the DA didn’t allow imports for the latter half of 2022, onions from other countries still managed to slip in. “Obviously, maraming imported onions sa market despite the fact na walang issue na import permits since July of last year. Malalaki yung pulang sibuyas (kumpara sa maliit na local onions) at maraming puting sibuyas ganung hindi pa naani ang mga puting sibuyas,” said Jayson Cainglet, executive director of Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG) in a January 8 statement. (There are a lot of imported onions in the market despite the fact that no import permits have been issued since July of last year. There are large red onions (compared to the small local onions), and there are many white onions even though white onions have yet to be harvested.) Senators pointed to smugglers that were illegally hauling in onions by the tons. Senator Cynthia Villar, who presided over the hearing, had specifically tagged four alleged smugglers whose names had surfaced in a previous Senate inquiry in April 2022. Of the four smugglers, none were prosecuted. Villar suspected that corruption and a conflict of interest in the Bureau of Customs (BOC) were among the reasons why no big-time smugglers were convicted in the six years since the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act had taken effect. “Walang nakasuhan kasi ang gumawa ng IRR [implementing rules and regulations], Bureau of Customs. Tapos nilagay nila sa IRR e sila ang magdedecide kung economic sabotage or not. So parang nagka-conflict because ang nag-decide kung economic sabotage or not is the one doing the crime,” she said. (No one was charged because the one made the IRR was the Bureau of Customs. And then they placed in the IRR that they will be the ones to decide if it is economic sabotage or not. So it’s as if there’s a conflict of interest because the one who decides if it’s economic sabotage or not is the one committing the crime.) To make matters worse, the BOC chased down individuals with small amounts of undeclared fruits and vegetables while big-time smugglers went unpunished, Senator JV Ejercito said. Earlier this January, ten Philippine Airlines (PAL) flight crew members were caught by the BOC after they brought in undeclared agricultural products – onions and fruits totalling $100. “Ang nakakalungkot itong ating pinuntirya Philippine Airlines crew na tag-dalawang kilo, isang kilo. Pero ‘yung mga container na nakakalusot e parang may pampabulag na tayo, pampalabo ng mata. Ano ba ang nangyayari sa atin?” Ejercito said. (It’s sad to see the focus on this Philippines Airlines crew that had only one or two kilos each. But the container-loads of smuggled goods slipped past them as if they were blind or their vision clouded. What’s happening to us?) Tulfo also chided the DA for allegedly turning a blind eye on smugglers. “Itong mga maliliit na pasalubong lang para sa kanilang pamilya, hinuhuli at papahiyain. Itong mga big-time, hindi pinahuhuli. Siguro kainuman niyo gabi-gabi, baka ka-coffee niyo. Siguro nandyan pa sa opisina niyo baka naka-dekwatro pa, nakataas pa siguro ang paa sa mesa habang kinakausap kayo tapos siguro may dalang sako-sakong salapi,” Tulfo said. (These small gifts for their family are being seized, and they’re being shamed. But the big-time offenders, no one arrests them. Maybe you’re out drinking with them every night, maybe you’re meeting over coffee. Maybe they’re at your office, cross-legged, or with their feet up your table while talking to you, and then they bring with them sacks of money.) Poe also raised concerns about how these smugglers – whose names had long been floating around – seemed impervious to charges. “‘Yung mga matatagal na kumilos na nagsmusmuggle ng mga bagay na ‘yan ay maikulong na sana kasi hindi pa rin po natututo. At tama ‘yung sinabi ni Senator Tulfo, baka naman kabarkada ng mga DA ang mga ‘yan,” Poe said during the hearing. (Those smugglers should be thrown in jail, since they never learn. And what Senator Tulfo said was right, maybe they’re all cozy with the DA.) BOC Assistant Commissioner Vincent Maronilla defended the agency, saying they were taking actions. (READ: Customs seizes P171 million in agri products, including onions, smuggled from China) “Meron po kaming 86 containers na nahuli recently (We caught 86 containers recently). These are onions. Dinaan po sa port ng (They passed through the port of) Mindanao Container Terminal, Subic, and Davao,” he said. But Villar laughed this off, saying that the 987 metric tons flagged by the BOC was “very small” and “irrelevant” compared to the actual number of smuggled goods. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/barangay-ginebra-jamie-malonzo-hungry-more-after-first-title/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Jamie Malonzo quickly proved that his trade to Barangay Ginebra was a match made in heaven as he helped the Gin Kings win the 2022 PBA Commissioner’s Cup title after a seven-game battle against the Bay Area Dragons. Acquired in a mid-season trade with the NorthPort Batang Pier for a package centered around Arvin Tolentino, Malonzo steadily earned his spot in head coach Tim Cone’s rotation, and gradually got more playing time as the playoffs rolled around. Despite having off nights expected from a second-year player, the 26-year-old high-flyer showed up when it mattered most and capped off the conference with a 22-point, 17-rebound eruption in the title-clinching Game 7 in front of 54,589 fans at the Philippine Arena. After winning his first PBA title, a visibly giddy Malonzo told reporters that there is so much more in store for him and his fast-growing fan base. “First conference is just scratching the surface together. For sure, I left it all on the line tonight. Game 7 in my first finals so I just want to get the job done. I was telling my teammates, ‘Anything we got to do to win,'” said the former one-and-done La Salle recruit. “I started slow, I had 4 points and then saw me erupt there. Stacked up some good possessions. But man. It was a good game. It was a good game.” Seen by many as the successor to the uber-athletic, yet aging and ailing Japeth Aguilar, Malonzo will have some big shoes to fill as he continues to play for the PBA’s most popular team and second-winningest franchise behind San Miguel. “I still feel like I’m still growing. So much left to work on, so much to take on this off-season. Break for a couple of weeks. I just want to keep my foot on the gas. I just think I’m getting better every conference,” he said. In his first run with Ginebra, Malonzo finished with averages of 12.2 points, 7.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.7 steals, and 0.9 blocks – stellar numbers for a local in an import-laden conference. – Rappler.com"

Have you been to the new Gyud Food Market yet? The newly-opened University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman Food Hub and its lineup of local concessionaires are now serving hungry students, families, barkadas, and communities looking for comfort grub any time of day. The spacious food court located along E. Jacinto Street near the College of Fine Arts opened in mid-January, operating daily from 7 am to 10 pm (not all stalls are open that early, though). The open-air structure has two levels, and is located beside a breezy garden that showcases pretty lights at night and has several picnic tables for comfortable al fresco group dining. Gyud Food Hub – which is a project helmed by Jose Magsaysay Jr. of Potato Corner, digital creator of Our Awesome Planet Anton Diaz, and other partners – simply means “Good Yummy Destination.” The neighborhood food market didn’t want to be a “mall” – that is why there are hardly any mall-based franchises here. Instead, the food businesses are hand-picked by Anton, with each one needing to have its own “story.” Most are mom-and-pop, lesser known names that serve high-quality food. The goal of Gyud Food Hub is for it to be an almost 24/7 food experience – that customers will be able to hit their “3-4 times a day meals” here. Have breakfast, lunch, merienda, and/or dinner at this location, plus dessert!

The first floor is reserved for dining, with all stalls set to open by end of January. Note that the price points aren’t ALL student budget-friendly – some meals can range up to P350 here – but there’s enough variety to go around. The food hub is meant to not only cater to students, but also to families out for the weekend, cycling communities stopping by, or alumni barkadas reuniting on their home turf. It’s a chill and no-frills place to enjoy a well-rounded feast with friends and family, or to relax in the fresh air while having a filling merienda by yourself.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-development-workers-gumanao-dayoha-families-ask-witnesses-send-photos-vidoes-abduction/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – The parents of development workers Dyan Gumanao and Armand Dayoha are appealing to witnesses of their pierside abduction to send any photos or videos of the incident that could help track down the perpetrators. Dennis Abarrientos of human rights group KARAPATAN-Central Visayas said in an ANC Rundown interview on Tuesday, January 17, that Gumanao and Dayoha’s families and friends were looking into “legal options” in relation to the alleged abduction. “Right now, we are looking at multiple legal angles. There are many legal options we can take. We are now evaluating all these prospects with our team,” Abarrientos said in a mix of Filipino and English. Danilo Gumanao, Dyan’s father, said this was why they needed more evidence to aid them in deciding which legal actions to pursue. “[K]aya patuloy ang pananawagan naming sa publiko, lalo na ‘yung nakawitness, nakakuha ng photos at videos, na kung puwede ipadala sa amin. Para madagdagan ang ebidensya sa amin sa pangyayari na ‘yun,” he said. (Which is why we continue our appeal to the public, especially to those who witnessed it, took photos and videos, to please send them to us. So that so we can have more the evidence of what happened.) The older Gumanao affirmed that videos shown were really his daughter and her partner, noting that they had friends who also took the same vessel and witnessed the abduction. Central Visayas police spokesperson Gerard Ace Pelare denied police involvement in the reported abduction. “It’s not the policy of the police to do these things,” he told ANC. “We arrest people after we have found evidence against them, then we charge them in court.” Activists, however, noted the similarities between the case of Gumanao and Dayoha and that of Davao Today journalist Margarita Valle who was arrested at the Laguindingan Airport in Misamis Oriental in June 2019. Valle was detained and deprived of liberty for 12 hours, without being shown any warrant or allowed access to a lawyer. Police released her after media and human rights networks raised the alarm, and acknowledged her detention as a  case of “mistaken identity.” When asked if he would order the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the case, Justice Secretary Boying Remulla replied: “NBI naman basta meron kayong notice (as long as you give notice), we will inform them. But I need details to inform them. Siguro (maybe), if you send me the details, I can ask the NBI in Cebu to look at the matter.” In a press conference on Monday, January 16, where it was announced that Gumanao and Dayoha had reunited with their families, a video of their alleged abduction reportedly sent by a witness was played to Cebu media. The footage shows persons struggling against multiple men shoving them into a light-colored vehicle. The crowd could be heard asking for help, while authorities appeared to merely look on. Gumanao’s father says they have not identified the car’s plate number. Gumanao and Dayoha were reunited with their family on Monday, in the northern Cebu town of Carmen, 42 kilometers from Cebu City, where they were allegedly taken. They were found six days after their disappearance on January 10. Abarrientos said that the two development workers were undergoing treatment for their trauma. “We hope that they will be able to recover very soon,” he said. – Rappler.com"

With all the different technical requirements, the safety concerns, and missteps, I apologize to you guys as well,” the actor and recording artist said. The event was held between January 13 and 14 at the North Reclamation Area in Mandaue City, Cebu. Many local fans came to watch both international performers and local artists, which include Pink Sweat$, Ben&Ben, December Avenue, and Denise Julia. While ticket prices were initially at P2,770 for general admission and P8,000 for VIP, Reid announced free entry to the public on the first day of the event, which upset some fans. To make up for it, ticket holders were told that they would receive P2,000 worth of free drinks, but these were only available on the second day of the event. Prior to this, organizers announced that there would be a free “plus one” festival pass for tickets bought between November 24, 2022, and January 12, 2023. Then, on January 14, Sepia Times, The Sundown, and Three Legged Men apologized to fans in separate statements on their official Facebook pages for being unable to perform on the first day of the music festival. In all three of the statements, the Cebu-based artists cited factors that were “beyond their control.” “We’ve prepared a good show for everyone but we’ll make it up to you guys,” wrote Three Legged Men. “We also appreciate everyone who messaged us to let us know that they’re out there waiting for us to perform while braving the crowd and the venue situation,” wrote The Sundown. “We really did want to see all your faces and play our music for you,” wrote Sepia Times. Three days later, on January 17, the organizers of the music fest released a statement explaining what had happened during the event. “Our event venue, staging, and programming were significantly impacted due to the poor weather conditions all over Cebu,” read their statement. Because of the aforementioned conditions, the organizers said they were forced to compress show time and cut the artists from the initial performance lineup. “We would like to stress that it was never our intention to insult the International, Cebu, and Manila artists who have graciously accepted our invitation. Nonetheless, we apologize to everyone, especially to the affected artists and their disappointed fans,” organizers said. – Rappler.com"

The Bucks, playing without two-time MVP and 31-point-per-game scorer Giannis Antetokounmpo for a third consecutive game due to knee soreness, used a dominant fourth quarter to avoid a three-game losing streak. Milwaukee outscored Indiana 39-21 in the final period thanks to a 14-of-18 shooting effort over the final 12 minutes. Holiday scored 11 points of his game-high total in the fourth quarter, while Grayson Allen knocked down a pair of 3-pointers early in the period en route to eight of his 17 points during the stanza. Allen’s performance, which also included five rebounds, four assists and two steals, was part of an all-around balanced effort for Milwaukee. Five Bucks scored in double figures, with Brook Lopez adding 19 points and Jordan Nwora coming off the bench to shoot 4 of 4 from 3-point range and finish with 14 points. George Hill returned for his first appearance since Jan. 6 and shot 4-for-6 from the floor for nine points. Hill also distributed six assists, with 32 of Milwaukee’s 48 made field goals coming off assists. The Bucks shot 48 of 91 from the field overall, including 23 of 46 from beyond the arc. Holiday, who went 5-for-8 from deep, led seven Milwaukee shooters connecting on at least two treys. Allen, Lopez and Portis each made three 3-point attempts. Indiana — playing its third consecutive game without NBA assists leader Tyrese Haliburton — dropped its fourth straight, marking the Pacers’ longest losing skid of the season.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/dfa-admits-low-aquittal-rate-ofws-facing-cases-abroad/,['MICHELLE ABAD'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) told a Senate hearing on Tuesday, January 17, that very few Filipinos accused of crimes abroad get acquitted despite available legal assistance from the Philippine government. At the hearing of the Senate committee on migrant workers, Senator Joel Villanueva flagged data from the DFA showing that there were zero acquittals of Filipinos facing criminal cases from January to June 2022. Senator Raffy Tulfo, committee chairman, asked Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega for the number of acquittals of Filipinos abroad in the last 5 to 10 years. “They don’t get a lot of acquittals, that’s the fact: We don’t get a lot of acquittals…. Usually, maximum, maybe less than a dozen a year, maybe? Kasi ang nangyayari diyan, most of the time, ang nangyayari paano natutulungan [ang] Filipino – nase-settle, hindi na dumidiretso pa sa kaso,” said De Vega. (Because, what happens there is that most of the time, how we help our Filipinos – these are settled and no longer prosper into cases.) According to the same chart, 1,278 Filipinos were convicted with finality out of the 5,141 monitored cases in that time period. Villanueva and Tulfo said this was “not acceptable.” “If there are no acquittals, what the hell are we doing here? We don’t even evaluate the things that we do. So, the next question would be, why zero acquittal? Is it weak evidence-gathering?” Villanueva said in a mix of English and Filipino. “Or mahina ‘yung mga abogadong nakuha ng ating DFA na para idepensa ‘yung sa Pilipino nationals na may problema sa abroad. Baka ‘yung mga tatakbuhin, sorry ah, pipitsuging abogado ang nakuha niyo, hindi ‘yung mga de kampanilya. Kaya parang zero acquittal lumilitaw,” said Tulfo. (Or the DFA is getting weak lawyers to defend Filipinos who have problems abroad. Maybe the ones they run to for help – sorry – are inept, not quality lawyers. That’s why we get zero acquittals.) The data was brought up during the hearing set to hear interpellations on a bill expanding the use of the DFA’s legal assistance fund (LAF) for overseas Filipino workers. While De Vega agreed with the senators that low acquittals are unacceptable, he also defended the DFA’s position, “The bottomline is they get legal representation kaysa wala (instead of nothing).” This did not reassure the senators. “Parang, ‘Sige, mayroon kayo, tapos bahala na kayo sa buhay ‘nyo,'” added Villanueva. (It’s like saying, “Okay, you can have lawyers, but after that, you’re on your own.) “Huwag ‘yung basta’t kuha lang tayo ng abogado basta’t magkaroon ng abogado. Dapat ‘yung abogado na magaling, abogadong de kalibre na alam ‘yung kaso, ‘yung kayang ipanalo ‘yung kaso,” said Tulfo. (You shouldn’t just be getting lawyers just for the sake of having them. You should get lawyers that are talented, quality, who are familiar with the cases, who can win the cases.) According to De Vega, the DFA conducts reviews after the lawyers render service, and is “always in touch” with posts regarding legal assistance via virtual meetings. The senators asked the DFA to submit documents on post-service reviews. In the Tuesday hearing, lawyer David Castillon of advocacy group Advocates & Keepers Organization-OFW (AKO-OFW) called on the government to monitor when OFWs are accused of theft, as abusive employers sometimes file theft cases to keep their Filipino workers from running away. “Hindi naman po talaga minsan totoong nagnakaw…. Ang gusto ng mga recruitment agency diyan, tulungan po ng ating POLO (Philippine Overseas Labor Office) na agad-agad masampahan po ng reklamo sa ministry ‘yung ating mga employer para hindi na po sila makaporma at mag-file pa po ng theft. Napakarami po niyan – imbis na ang napaparusahan, ‘yung amo, nababaliktad pa po,” said Castillon. (Sometimes, [the workers] don’t actually steal… The recruitment agencies want our POLOs to help immediately file cases against employers with the ministry so that they can’t strategize and file a case of theft. There are so many of those – instead of the employer getting punished, it’s the other way around.) The Department of Migrant Workers, now with its first annual budget, has legal assistance available with its Agarang Kalinga at Saklolo para sa mga OFWs na Nangangailangan (AKSYON) Fund. Because the AKSYON fund is for OFWs, the DFA has said that its LAF would be used for non-OFWs, like migrants, students, and Filipinos married to foreigners. However, De Vega said that the DFA may still use its LAF for OFWs in host countries that do not have Migrant Workers Offices, formerly known as POLOs. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-lunar-new-year-travel-offers-economic-rebound-from-covid-19/,[],"SHANGHAI, China – Urban workers crowded train stations across China’s largest cities on Tuesday, January 17, as the country’s mass migration for Lunar New Year holidays hit high gear, an early sign of economic recovery as officials confirmed a historic plunge due to COVID-19 curbs. The world’s second-largest economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, data showed on Tuesday, dragging 2022 growth down to one its worst performances in nearly half a century after three years of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns. With mass travel for the Lunar New Year possible for the first time in nearly three years after the relaxing of some of the world’s tightest COVID-19 curbs, the economy stands to gain from hundreds of thousands of people a day spending more as they return to China’s hinterland. While many analysts say a return to economic normality will be gradual as the impact of COVID-19 weakens, some see the Lunar New Year as a welcome early consumption boost. “Peak infections passed in major cities in January, and with the Spring Festival coming, tourism is back, and the signs of a
recovery in consumption are obvious,” said Nie Wen, a Shanghai based economist at the investment firm Hwabao Trust. But even as workers move out, health experts fear a broadening and deepening of its COVID-19 outbreak, leaving the elderly in rural villages particularly vulnerable. Despite Chinese authorities confirming a huge increase in deaths on Saturday – announcing that nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospitals between December 8 and January 12 – World
Health Organization (WHO) officials are seeking a more sweeping accounting of death rates. The WHO earlier welcomed Saturday’s announcement after last week warning that China was heavily under-reporting deaths from the virus. Specifically, the UN agency wants information on so-called excess mortality – the number of all deaths beyond the norm during a crisis, the WHO said in a statement to Reuters. “This is especially important during periods of surges when the health system is severely constrained,” the statement said on Monday. The WHO added that it would continue working with China to provide advice and support, but had not yet fixed another formal meeting with Chinese officials after WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke with Ma Xiaowei, director of China’s National Health Commission, at the weekend. The Ministry of Transport has estimated the rush will see a total of 2.1 billion passenger trips nationwide between January 7 and February 15 as many Chinese city dwellers make the most of their first chance for Lunar New Year trips to see extended family in home regions since the pandemic began. Chinese officials jettisoned Beijing’s “zero COVID” policy – an approach previously championed by ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinping – in early December, letting the virus run unchecked across its population of 1.4 billion people. Those stringent policies have further damaged China’s demographic outlook, now at the start of a historic decline with government figures released on Tuesday showing the population fell for the first time in six decades. State media reported that some 390,000 passengers were expected to travel from Shanghai train stations on Tuesday alone for what is known as the Spring Festival holiday – seen as the world’s largest annual mass migration before COVID. As travellers moved through stations in Shanghai, China’s largest city, some expressed optimism despite the risks. “I am not worried about the virus. Because we are young, our immunity is okay,” 37-year-old migrant worker Zhou Ning told Reuters outside the Shanghai Railway Station as he prepared to head back to his home area in Bazhong in the northeastern province of Sichuan. “Back in my hometown, there are many people who have tested positive, but I am not worried about it.” On a train leaving Shanghai, fellow migrant worker Feng Hongwei, aged 21, said he was “so happy, so excited” as he began a trek home to Puyang, Henan. “I haven’t seen my parents in two years”. The holiday season has also sparked a revival in domestic air travel with more than 70,000 flights across China between January 7-13, according to industry data reported by Shanghai Securities News on Monday. That’s equivalent to more than 80% of the levels seen before the pandemic. International air links are also recovering. Emirates Airlines on Monday became the latest carrier to announce it would resume services from its Dubai hub to Shanghai this week, and would operate daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from March. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/science/discoveries-inventions/scientists-unearth-megaraptors-feathered-dinosaur-fossils-chile-patagonia/,[],"Scientists in Chile’s Patagonia region are unearthing the southernmost dinosaur fossils recorded outside Antarctica, including remains of megaraptors that would have dominated the area’s food chain before their mass extinction. Fossils of megaraptors, a carnivorous dinosaur that inhabited parts of South America during the Cretaceous period some 70 million years ago, were found in sizes up to 10 meters long, according to the Journal of South American Earth Sciences. “We were missing a piece,” Marcelo Leppe, director of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), told Reuters. “We knew where there were large mammals, there would also be large carnivores, but we hadn’t found them yet.” The remains, recovered from Chile’s far south Rio de las Chinas Valley in the Magallanes Basin between 2016 and 2020, also include some unusual remains of unenlagia, velociraptor-like dinosaurs which likely lived covered in feathers. The specimens, according to University of Chile researcher Jared Amudeo, had some characteristics not present in Argentine or Brazilian counterparts. “It could be a new species, which is very likely, or belong to another family of dinosaurs that are closely related,” he said, adding more conclusive evidence is needed. The studies also shed more light on the conditions of the meteorite impact on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula that may have triggered the dinosaurs’ extinction some 65 million years ago. INACH’s Leppe pointed to a sharp drop in temperatures over present-day Patagonia and waves of intense cold lasting up to several thousand years, in contrast to the extremely warm climate that prevailed for much of the Cretaceous period. “The enormous variation we are seeing, the biological diversity, was also responding to very powerful environmental stimuli,” Leppe said. “This world was already in crisis before (the meteorite) and this is evidenced in the rocks of the Rio de las Chinas Valley,” he said. – Rappler.com"

Murray’s determination never wavered, though, and he held his nerve in the deciding 10-point tiebreak, closing out the match with incredible fortune as his bunted forehand return caught the net and left Berrettini no chance.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-extravagant-swiss-junket-marcos-davos/,[],"Amid a worsening economic crisis highlighted by a spike in the price of onions, eggs, and pork, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. sees it fit to bring 70 delegates with him to the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, Switzerland from January 15 to 20, 2023. This is the biggest delegation attending the forum, and it includes a coterie of senators, congressmen, cabinet secretaries, businessmen, showbusiness celebrities, and the President’s sister, Irene Marcos Araneta. Mr. Marcos will be the only leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the forum. Other states are sending much leaner delegations, and only a few of them include the country’s chief executive. Apparently, Klaus Schwab, WEF founder and executive chairperson, invited Mr. Marcos to the event on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia last November 12. It took a month for the President to finally decide to accept the invitation. By the time he did, hotels in Davos were already fully booked, and only hotels in nearby Zurich were available at a price range of P10,000 to P39,000 per room per day, according to a Vera Files commentary by social anthropologist Antonio J. Montalvan II. To book a delegation of 70, the Philippine government will have to spend taxpayers’ money worth anywhere from P4.2 million to P16 million on hotel rooms alone for a six-day stay. Amid economic hardships back home, should Filipinos be spending this much for the hotel accommodations of their President and his 70-member entourage abroad? “We want to hear the story of the Philippines,” Schwab reportedly told the President. One wonders if Mr. Marcos needs 70 people to tell that story, whatever it is, in Davos. One also wonders if the impending hotel bookings at Zurich are a coincidence. The city happens to be hosting the offices of Swiss Credit Bank, where the President’s father, Ferdinand Sr., and mother, Imelda, opened multimillion-dollar accounts in the names of William Saunders and Jane Ryan during their dictatorship, as per records of the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The accounts have since been frozen and turned over to the Philippine National Bank. Switzerland also happens to be the host of seven private foundations set up by the President’s parents, and to which the former First Couple channeled multimillion-dollar investments to benefit them and their beneficiaries, namely the incumbent President and his two sisters, Senator Imee Marcos and Irene, who is in the President’s entourage on this trip to Davos. The Sandiganbayan has since convicted the President’s mother for maintaining the private foundations. Now in view of such wanton corruption, what kind of story will the President and his entourage be talking about while in Switzerland? Malacaňang was quick to deny that this trip would revive the issue of ill-gotten wealth against the Marcoses. Likewise, amid social media reports that one of its flights to Vancouver was canceled and commandeered by Mr. Marcos for the trip to Switzerland, Philippine Airlines was quick to issue a denial. But the nation’s flag carrier remained silent on reports that pilots involved were made to sign a non-disclosure agreement on the matter. What will the Philippines gain from this highly expensive junket? Only promises of future investments, if any. Mr. Marcos also announced that he intends to use the WEF to do a soft launch of his controversial Maharlika Investment Fund, which has been criticized by business groups and economists as a foolish move. Aside from the questionable benefits it will supposedly bring to the Philippine economy, this soft launch is far from responsive to the immediate and recurring problems now besetting the nation. “I am undecided yet. It’s traveling too much,” the President admitted when asked about the WEF invitation during last November’s ASEAN Summit. “That’s already the end of January. I’m going to China on the third. Parang…like my mom says, ‘Kailan ka nag-oopisina (When do you go to the office)?’” It is not clear what made Mr. Marcos change his mind. Perhaps he should have trusted his instincts the first time he thought about this trip. In fact, his administration will have to seriously reconsider its priorities and the way it is using the trillion-peso national budget, including confidential funds exceeding the limits of plunder, on expensive foreign trips and other frivolities. – Rappler.com Daniel Agoncillo has worked as an editor in various newspapers for 17 years.

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/wavy-baby-beyond-what-means-bisaya-musicians-treated-collateral-damage/,[],"The following is Rappler music contributor Kara Angan’s personal take on the Wavy Baby controversy. Over the weekend, three Cebu-based acts that were slated to perform at Careless Music’s Wavy Baby Festival released statements on their removal from the festival’s lineup. It was the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the James Reid-led Sinulog music festival. Inclement weather in Cebu last Friday forced organizers to delay the opening of Day 1. In response, the Careless Music team made entry for the first day free to the public, with festival-goers struggling to walk through the muddy concert grounds. This then led to the original schedules for the music festival being shuffled to accommodate the delays. As a result, some of the acts were abruptly stopped from performing altogether. Careless Music’s original lineup was billed as the “first of its kind” for Sinulog, with a number of international and Manila-based artists performing for the first time in the Queen City of the South. Among these acts were Korean-American rapper Dumbfoundead, Filipino-Canadian rap duo Manila Grey, GOT7 member Bambam, and Korean singer Sunmi, just to name a few. Careless Music also featured several of their own artists, such as new signees Destiny Rogers, August Wahh, and SOS (formerly known as She’s Only Sixteen). At the bottom of the bill was some of Cebu’s most prominent acts — rapper Cookie$, alt pop duo Sepia Times, Wanderbattle 2020 winners The Sundown, Three Legged Men, Mandaue Nights, and The Wonggoys. For the local Cebuano fan, these bands are mainstays in the scene, each with their own strong community of fans and fellow artists. It made sense that they would be included in a festival that proudly used Sinulog as part of its marketing. In an official TikTok posted by the label, James Reid shared that they specifically chose Cebu as a venue because “Sinulog is one of the biggest cultural festivals in the country.” However, on January 14, Sepia Times, The Sundown, and Three Legged Men each issued statements on their sudden removal from the festival lineups. All the reasons were similar, with each act citing that they were unable to perform “due to circumstances beyond their control.” In their statement, Sepia Times shared that they were already at the venue “when the events started to unfold.” Following this, local folk musician and guitarist of The Sundown Vincent Eco shared on Facebook in a mix of Bisaya and English, “Yet again, [they] hold concerts in Cebu but made Cebu bands disposable.” Out of the original eight non-Careless affiliated Cebuano acts slated to perform during the festival, only four were able to: Pinoy rock mainstays Urbandub and Franco, rapper Cookie$, and Mandaue Nights. Cebuanos were quick to call out the inconsistencies of the festival in treating their invited artists: if time constraints were an issue, then why did the organizers allow for acts that weren’t able to perform on Day 1 (SOS, James Reid, and Manila Grey) to perform on Day 2 instead? For a festival that capitalized on our festival, on our culture, it was quick to turn Cebu-based acts into collateral damage to accommodate delays. On January 17, James Reid and Eventscape Productions Manila released statements apologizing to the bands cut from the lineup as well as to their fans. In a video, Reid said, “I would like to sincreley apologize to our Cebu artists, [the] Wonggoys, Three Legged Men, The Sundown, and Sepia Times for not being able to share the stage with you this time. But thank you for allowing us to come to your hometown and throw this amazing experience. I promise we’ll make it up to you. You guys are all legends, thank you.” The Eventscape Productions statement shared a similar sentiment, emphasizing that some Manila and international artists were also not able to perform, “not just Cebu bands.” They continued by saying that “it was never [their] intention to insult the international, Cebu, and Manila artists who have graciously accepted our invitation.” While the apology is welcome, this issue has shed light on the divide between the Manila-centric mainstream and the music scenes of Visayas and Mindanao. Last October, the Vispop Music Festival issued a strongly worded statement appealing for the support of Cebuanos for its annual Sinulog festival. Cebuano songwriter and co-founder of Vispop Jude Gitamondoc wrote, “…Right now, Manila organizers are gearing up their machinery to stage multiple music festivals during Sinulog Week […] Sugod pa lang karon [As early as now], we’re beseeching our fans and supporters to stand by, with, and for Vispop Music Festival. We may not have as much funding and clout as these more established music festivals, but we trust that we will have you, our audience, to rally with us and for us amidst the noise by bringing people to our show. This is our chance to prove that Bisaya music deserves its long overdue space in OPM.” One of the strongest sentiments of the statement is this: “We will not be forever relegated to the sidelines. We will not be a mere afterthought in a scheme to please the locals. We will not remain just front acts to Manila’s main event.” The cultural, economic, and social divide between Visayas-Mindanao and “Imperial Manila” manifests itself in all aspects — even music. In an interview between HipHopDX Asia and Bisaya rap OGs Midnasty, the latter shared how in the past, Bisaya rap would be treated as “novelty songs.” They shared, “That’s the reason why, kami sad, nagseryoso mi sa music na gi-Bisaya mi kay ganahan mi mag-push gyud further ang Bisaya. Kami sad sa Midnasty, our responsibility is how to put something new, something unique nga sound para sa Bisaya pud na music.” (That’s the reason why, even us, we make it a point to rap in Bisaya because we want to push the language further. Even us in Midnasty, our responsibility is how to put something new, a unique sound, into Bisaya music.) The problem isn’t the lack of Bisaya musicians. In fact, there are more than enough Bisaya musicians in every genre across Visayas and Mindanao. For example, Midnasty’s Paraisla movement has built a network and community providing support for Bisaya rappers and producers. This has spawned its own record label and different collectives that provide Bisaya rappers with a platform for their music. Multiple Cebu-based record labels such as 22 Tango Records and Melt Records have continually pushed to provide opportunities for budding artists across the region. Vispop Music Festival, which also organizes Vispop, a songwriting competition and camp for Bisaya songwriters, has been organizing events for the past 10 years. When Cebuano — and by extension, Bisaya— acts are turned into collateral damage, it further deepens the existing divide that is prevalent in our country. Issues surrounding the quality of life and rate of development in different provinces outside of Metro Manila goes beyond numbers. Music, art, and culture is sacred because these are what drive and represent our identity. Whether you like it or not, the concept of identity in the Philippines is ethnocentric, meaning that every province has a unique identity associated with their cultures. For example, in Cebu, some of the pillars of what makes us “proudly Cebuano” are things like Sinulog, lechon, our language, and other common experiences that are uniquely ours. Cultural festivals are the pride of every community and are often defined by them — whether it’s Ati-Atihan, MassKara, Nazareno, and more. When Manila-based labels and acts disrespect our musicians, they disrespect our identities as Cebuanos, regardless of their intentions. More than that, when a festival like Wavy Baby capitalizes on our cultural festival yet removes a platform for Cebuanos to showcase their experiences through music, it goes back to the very problem that Midnasty pointed out before: that Bisaya music is treated as a novelty. In a way, the controversies surrounding Wavy Baby Festival has brought to light the importance of carving out spaces for Bisaya music to shine in the mainstream and beyond the communities that are already loyal to them. What could have served as an avenue to highlight Cebuano talent in the heart of the Visayas was turned into an encroachment into a scene that has been regularly pushed to the sidelines. The challenge for Manila-based labels and organizers moving forward is simple: if you’re going to brand yourself as inclusive and diverse, then the least you can do is let our acts perform. – Rappler.com"

She faces a possible jail term of up to 15 years. Following a crackdown on protesters, she became the head of an opposition-in-exile and denounced the election after Lukashenko, in power since 1994, declared himself the winner. Tsikhanouskaya, who now lives in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, told Reuters in the Swiss resort of Davos that she did not expect the trial to be fair. “In Belarus there are no honest trials. We live in absolute lawlessness in our country so tomorrow’s trial will be a farce and a show but not real justice,” Tsikhanouskaya said on Monday in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. She said she had asked for the necessary documents from the court-appointed lawyer, but had not received anything. The BelTa state news agency said the trial had started on Tuesday morning. Tsikhanouskaya and several others were to be tried on charges of treason and attempting to seize power, the court said before the trial. “Tsikhanouskaya, while on the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, proclaimed herself the winner of the last election… and the only national leader elected by the Belarusian people,” the General Prosecutor’s Office said. A day before the trial was due to begin, Belarus brought new criminal charges against Tsikhanouskaya’s jailed husband, a 44-year-old video blogger, who was arrested in 2020 while attempting to run for office against Lukashenko himself. His arrest prompted Tsikhanouskaya to run for office in his place despite having no public profile, and she was allowed onto the ballot. Rights activists estimate about 1,500 people are in jail in Belarus on politically motivated charges. Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia who has been in power since 1994, is a pariah in the West and a close ally of Russia. Belarus also put rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Byalyatski, and two others, on trial this month on charges of financing protests and smuggling money. They could face from seven to 12 years in jail on charges of financing protests and smuggling money. – Rappler.com"

A parade, which featured colorful floats and traditional Chinese costumes, marked the second day of the week-long festivities in the city ahead of the start of the Lunar New Year or the Chinese New Year. It was highlighted by the dragon dance which was well-received by the crowd who cheered and took photos of the performance. For the Chinese, the traditional dance by a group that moved the silk and paper dragon in a serpentine manner to the rhythm of the drums and gongs symbolized good luck and prosperity. Tuesday’s grand parade to greet the coming Year of the Rabbit started in front of city hall and ended at the Bell Church, a Chinese temple that is a major cultural site in Macasandig, Cagayan de Oro. The week-long celebration will come to a close with a grand fireworks display at the Bell Church on the eve of the Lunar New Year on Saturday, January 21. As part of the celebration, city hall employees will be treated to tours around the temple starting on Tuesday afternoon. Cagayan de Oro information officer Ivy Guantero said the local government has teamed up with the Chinese-Filipino community here to greet the Lunar New Year with a week of festivities. “We are hoping the Year of the Rabbit will usher prosperity and hope, and a rebound for the local business community. We are crossing our fingers, and wish that the rabbit will be kind to us this year,” Guantero said. Guantero said the local business community, Chinese-Filipinos included, took a beating during the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. She said there will be more dragon dance performances on major streets in the city throughout the week, and a dragon boat race – a popular traditional sport in China – is expected to draw a large crowd along the Cagayan River on Saturday. Cagayan de Oro is known for its diverse culture and vibrant festivals, and the beginning of the Year of the Rabbit celebration is one of the most awaited events of the year. Mayor Rolando Uy expressed the city government’s appreciation for the contributions of Chinese Filipinos, adding that they have long been an integral part of the city’s growth and development. From small businesses to large-scale investments, the Chinese have played a significant role in shaping the local economy, he said. Despite its relatively small size, the Chinese-Filipino community in Cagayan de Oro has made a significant impact on the city’s economy and culture. They have established many successful businesses, and their contributions to Cagayan de Oro’s development have been recognized by the local government. In terms of education, the local Chinese-Filipino community also established schools, such as Kong Hua School, to teach Chinese and culture to the next generation. In Mindanao, grand celebrations are being held this week in cities with larger Chinese populations such as Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Zamboanga, and General Santos. The merrymaking is characterized by lion and dragon dance performances, fireworks, parades, lantern displays, traditional Chinese music, cultural shows, and food festivals. Uy said all these were a way to showcase Chinese culture and tradition and help bring Chinese and Filipino communities together, promoting understanding and appreciation for each other’s heritage. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-charles-keith-status-signaling-filipina-teen/,[],"I have made it a habit to check the happenings on various social media platforms. This, I believe, should be standard practice for professors in the Social Sciences disciplines in order to stay updated about the “pulse” of the people. I, then, integrate “what is viral” into my lessons. I find this more effective in engaging my students. One of the things that have gone “viral” recently is the debate on the “luxuriousness” of goods. This happened after Zoe Gabriel, a 17-year-old Singapore-based Filipina teenager, called Charles & Keith a luxury brand. Some netizens questioned Zoe’s claim that a Charles & Keith tote bag is a luxury brand. Some even labeled Zoe as pretentious and ridiculous. Thereafter, a debate on the subjectivity of luxury emerged on various social media platforms. The uproar on the subjectivity of luxury reminded me of a study titled Signaling Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence. This study proposed a taxonomy of consumers according to their wealth and need for status. Patricians are essentially the legit wealthy. They are so wealthy that they do not see the point of publicly displaying their wealth. They, however, want to associate themselves with their fellow patricians. They do this through subtle signals that only other patricians would recognize. In the case of tote bags, for example, logos of prominently expensive brands would only either appear subtly (i.e. as small symbols in the goods) or would not be showing at all. Only those who can truly afford and have access to these luxurious goods will know that such a designer tote bag is valued as much as another person’s house, car, and annual income combined! Why are they doing this? Well, they want to gatekeep. They do not want to be associated with the supposedly pretentious middle class, the parvenus. The parvenus are the wealthy middle class who are considered by the patricians as “unpolished.” These parvenus aim to be associated with the patricians, and their way of doing this is through brand associations. They spend sums of money to avail of brands tagged as luxurious. Going back to my tote bag example, the parvenus also buy prominently expensive brands. However, unlike the patricians who like their brands subtle, the parvenus favor designs with brands more visible (i.e. large symbols and texts indicative of the brand), if not shouting. Brand visibility is a statement – “We are beyond your reach!” Poseurs, from the word poser, describes people who pretend to be what they are not. These poseurs aim to be tagged as wealthy, so they want to associate with prominently expensive brands. However, since they do not have the means to afford authentic luxury goods, they avail of Class A or counterfeit goods in lieu of the original. Proletarians are the final group of consumers. They are the poor who do not even bother with status signaling and brand associations since their concern is to have enough to get by each day. Taking into consideration the collective standards of consumers, as well as their personal feelings, tastes, values, and opinions, among others, the subjectivity of luxury debate becomes further complicated. In the context of whether Charles & Keith is a luxury brand debate, will the patricians even engage in such discussion? How about the comment, “Who’s gonna tell her?”  Does it reek of a parvenu who wants to be dissociated from a poseur, or a poseur from another poseur? I suppose, however, the more important question here is why people have the need to show off what they have. To answer this, allow me to briefly discuss another related concept: commodity fetishism.  “Commodity” pertains to something that is bought and sold or exchanged in a market, while “fetishism,” from the word fetish, historically pertains to a man-made object believed to possess some supernatural powers. Combining these two concepts and applying them in the context of the consumers, “commodity fetishism” pertains to how consumers fetishize material objects (such as luxury bags and clothing brands) as well as cultural products (such as attending concerts and traveling the world) since these have highly desirable symbolic value in society. We now live in a society where a huge fraction of our time is spent consuming content on various social media platforms. Much of the content we see today has themes of showing off purchases of luxurious commodities and extravagant lifestyles. This kind of content is functional for the content creator. It creates content and clout – both of which are important, for the content creator’s aim is to attract more followers since such translates to financial rewards and influence. One of the unintended consequences of flexing material objects and cultural products, however, is the creation of a false sense of reality. Consumers of content aspire to live up to the standards set by these content creators. Akin to a poseur to a parvenu or a parvenu to a patrician, followers who have become content creators themselves have mirrored their more popular counterparts in showing off their symbols of success in life. However, since many do not have access to the resources necessary to execute such a lifestyle, they have resorted to what I call “reproduction” and “simulation” of contents. Reproduction of content pertains to the copying of the format as well as the “vibe” or atmosphere of existing content. An example of a common formula for Tiktok content are teenagers showing their purchase “journey” – making the process of their procurement of certain luxury goods the content in itself. Unlike simulation, however, content creators who merely follow a certain formula do not cheat their followers by pretending to have what they do not have. Simulation of content, on the other hand, pertains not only to the copying of the format but also to the altering of the reality by content creators. They mirror the usage of luxurious items by other popular content creators as well as their lavish lifestyles. However, since these creators do not have the means to perfectly copy the original content of those with means, they resort to cheating their followers by pretending to have what they do not have. An example of this is a travel influencer from Buenos Aires who gained hundreds and thousands of followers for posting travel photos on Instagram. She was canceled by many of her followers since they found out that she merely edited herself into various locations around the world. The same scenario happened to this Dubai-based model who was canceled after posting on Instagram that she was in business class when in fact she had only taken pictures of herself in the business-class cabin and thereafter returned to her seat in economy. The more popular example is the case o “bai fu mei” (rich and pretty girls) in China. Here, a group of popular Chinese influencers endeavored to make themselves look rich without spending a fortune by renting luxury items and splitting the costs. For example, they rented a Birkin bag for a month at 1,500 RMB (around P12,200) and divided the amount amongst them. Each of them took turns using the bag, had their photos taken with the bag, and uploaded such photos to their respective social media accounts. In the case of the Philippines, notions of equating happiness, fulfillment, and success to luxury items and extravagant lifestyles are often seen in the scripts of MLM (multi-level-marketing) agents. They entice by posting content on social media of themselves with luxury items such as expensive shoes, bags, and even sports cars, which essentially tells their potential clients these are examples of the rewards to be gained for being open-minded to networking business. Many, however, have become skeptics to the truthfulness of these agents’ claims given their desperation to recruit. Open-minded ka ba sa business? has become a nationwide inside joke for Filipinos, since there was a time when many were deceived by their agent relatives, friends, and acquaintances, who would turn a supposed kamustahan into an ambush orientation to join their networking. In a world filled with pretentions, we have become more guarded, wary that we might be cheated by the content creators that we are following. In the face of clear or suspected pretensions, we do not hesitate to bash, or “cancel” as it is now oftentimes called, the pretender. However, in our quest to root out the poseurs, we might end up hurting people, such as Zoe Gabriel, who merely wanted to celebrate a milestone in life. This now begs the question: how far will we go? – Rappler.com Minami Iwayama is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines."

To reiterate, the rule is that if the deadline falls on a weekend or on a holiday, the deadline is automatically moved to the next working day. Still, it would be prudent to file on or before the deadline set by the BIR, so that you do not have to rush your tax filings. Aside from compliance with the annual BIR requirements, businesses also need to secure their barangay clearance as well as their business or mayor’s permit. Generally, the deadline for the renewal of business permits is on every 20th day of January. Failure to renew your business permit would subject your business to a 25% surcharge penalty and an interest at the rate not exceeding 2% per month of delay. However, in no case shall the total interest on the unpaid amount exceed 36 months. This penalty is imposed by the respective LGU which has jurisdiction over your business. What’s more, you could also be liable to the BIR for the “unlawful pursuit of business.” Under Section 258 of the Tax Code, you will be imposed a fine of P5,000 to P20,000 and an imprisonment of six months to two years.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-population-drop-demographic-crisis/,[],"China’s population fell last year for the first time in six decades, a historic turn that is expected to mark the start of a long period of decline in its citizen numbers with profound implications for its economy and the world. The drop, the worst since 1961, the last year of China’s Great Famine, also lends weight to predictions that India will become the world’s most populous nation this year. China’s population declined by roughly 850,000 to 1.41175 billion at the end of 2022, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics said. Long-term, UN experts see China’s population shrinking by 109 million by 2050, more than triple the decline of their previous forecast in 2019. That’s caused domestic demographers to lament that China will get old before it gets rich, slowing the economy as revenues drop and government debt increases due to soaring health and welfare costs. “China’s demographic and economic outlook is much bleaker than expected. China will have to adjust its social, economic, defense and foreign policies,” said demographer Yi Fuxian. He added that the country’s shrinking labour force and downturn in manufacturing heft would further exacerbate high prices and high inflation in the United States and Europe. Kang Yi, head of the national statistics bureau, told reporters that people should not worry about the decline in population as “overall labor supply still exceeds demand”. China’s birth rate last year was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, down from a rate of 7.52 births in 2021 and marking the lowest birth rate on record. The number of Chinese women of childbearing age, which the government defines as 25 to 35, fell by about 4 million, Kang said. The death rate, the highest since 1974 during the Cultural Revolution, was 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, which compares with rate of 7.18 deaths in 2021. Much of the demographic downturn is the result of China’s one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015 as well as sky-high education costs that have put many Chinese off having more than one child or even having any at all. The data was the top trending topic on Chinese social media after the figures were released on Tuesday, January 17. One hashtag – “#Is it really important to have offspring?” – had hundreds of millions of hits. “The fundamental reason why women do not want to have children lies not in themselves, but in the failure of society and men to take up the responsibility of raising children. For women who give birth this leads to a serious decline in their quality of life and spiritual life,” posted one netizen with the username Joyful Ned. China’s stringent zero-COVID policies that were in place for three years have caused further damage to the country’s demographic outlook, population experts have said. Local governments have since 2021 rolled out measures to encourage people to have more babies, including tax deductions, longer maternity leave and housing subsidies. President Xi Jinping also said in October the government would enact further supportive policies. The measures so far, however, have done little to arrest the long-term trend. Online searches for baby strollers on China’s Baidu search engine dropped 17% in 2022 and are down 41% since 2018, while searches for baby bottles are down more than a third since 2018. In contrast, searches for elderly care homes surged eight-fold last year. The reverse is playing out in India, where Google Trends shows a 15% year-on-year increase in searches for baby bottles in 2022, while searches for cribs rose almost five-fold. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-guide-money-laundering/,[],"Right off the bat, 2023 has immediately ushered in a new set of scandals. But lest we forget, 2022 remains an unmade bed. Falsehood, fake news, public relations spin, historical revisionism, and laundering – money, hidden wealth or otherwise – are conceptual synonyms. The latter two, given recent statutory machinations catalyzed by transactional politics, are intimately related and share parental DNA in many ways. Now that the proposed Maharlika Investment Fund (MWF) has become one of the most toxic of topics, and which for some is incurable despite herculean efforts to cleanse it of inherent flaws, this allows us to illustrate methods to launder illegally gotten wealth. Financial fraud is after all a complex crime. It often includes complementary predicates. Where even former Supreme Court justices have opined on inherent unconstitutionality, where funds might automatically be funneled from pensions from specific constituencies, as lettered economists, bankers, and the country’s most credible business groups and chambers of commerce unanimously express their deepest fears, one of the least discussed is the potential for money laundering. It is the bane of any investment for as long as certain characteristics are worked into it. For those hell-bent on altering history, superimposing new narratives over established facts, any laundering, whether it involves plundered wealth, the cleansing of notorious ignominy, or even simply the misrepresentation of educational records, is an integral part of historical revisionism. Historical revisionism that induces mass amnesia is especially disconcerting where undiscovered billions plundered generations ago remain hidden in some foreign land, especially in the face of our continuing poverty, underemployment, runaway inflation, and an imminent recession half a century hence. It is a cause for concern when generic sovereign investment funds obfuscate sources and thus provide anonymity. But apart from anonymity, there are other characteristics that raise red flags. There is the application of generous doses of fragrance enhancers and odor-eaters in the form of charitable institutions, or philanthropic and developmental objectives claiming to alleviate the plight of the destitute and poor. Note how laundering using lotteries, sweepstakes draws, or foundations can be used to cleanse what would otherwise be dirty. There is also money laundering through games of chance, where the prize money is large and where both benefactors and beneficiaries remain unidentified, their identities as well as sudden one-time surges in personal assets protected. Where bureaucracies have erected the highest walls around the statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth (SALN) requisites, the genus impuratus can confidently compliment by claiming charitable lottery or sweepstakes windfalls. The inconsistencies and ambivalence in enforcing SALN disclosures likewise enable “rich uncle inheritances” as convenient laundering options. A third method is the use of the state-run casino system to bury fruits of plunder among the daily anonymous wins and losses of gaming and gambling. The ultimate objective is to quickly transform plundered proceeds, even unused campaign donations, into other forms of wealth, less obvious and less malodorous. The choices are legion, ranging from missing priceless paintings, even lost Picassos that end up in private collections, to real estate, rare metals, precious jewelry, and cryptocurrencies. Add to the list fabled pre-Spanish era gold and golden-domed New York buildings and apartments. Another, albeit not a mutually exclusive, modus, is to use an alias for Swiss or offshore accounts, and a tax-haven address plus a cryptic post office drop-box. Anonymity is the critical default. The options may involve charitable foundations, estates, holding companies, dummies, and offshore deposits. Remember the infamous example that relates both laundering and revisionism intimately? Historical records show that in 1968, between March 20 and 21, spouses using names like “Saunders” and “Ryan“ opened four offshore bank accounts with instructions that all correspondence be directed through a third party via a Manila Post Office box. The deposit was well over 3,000% of the couple’s known 1968 income. To sum up, employing the critical anonymity factor, it would not be difficult to launder long-plundered hidden wealth as fruits of offshore investments. – Rappler.com Dean de la Paz is a former investment banker and managing director of a New Jersey-based power company operating in the Philippines.

Having also been put through the wringer by the big-hitting Niemeier in their previous meeting, Swiatek raised her game when needed to avoid becoming only the second top seed to fall at the Australian Open’s first hurdle after Virginia Ruzici in 1979. In a rematch of their US Open fourth-round meeting where Swiatek battled from a set and break down to prevail, the Pole revved up her backhand to save two break points before a nervy hold as Niemeier gave her little room to work the angles. But the top seed targeted world No. 68 Niemeier’s serve to grab the decisive break and with it the opening set, before surrendering serve early in the next only to hit back from 2-0 down to level at 5-5 before going on to seal the victory. “I knew I could get my focus up a little bit, the intensity a little bit more. So I did that,” said Swiatek, who has won in the opening round of a major in 15 of her last 16 appearances. “But, yeah, for sure, my goal for the next matches is not being in those situations and not starting the set losing a break. But it happens. “I’m happy I was able to come back. It wasn’t like I needed to really change a lot. I just needed to, as I said, have more intensity.” Swiatek, who has been backed to stamp her authority on the women’s game by winning the title vacated by retired local favourite Ash Barty, will continue her quest for a fourth major when she meets Colombia’s Camila Osorio in the second round. The 21-year-old said she planned to follow the example of Barty and “be in the bubble” to cut down on social media use in a bid to shut out the noise after a period of complacency. “I think the pre-season, and actually using more social media than during the season, not being focused on matches but doing everything I wanted to, it kind of ruined my rhythm a little bit,” Swiatek said. “On the other hand, you also need that time to charge up your energy. I feel right now it’s a little bit harder to have this bubble and not feel all these interruptions and expectations. “But that’s my plan, to be in the bubble. I always enjoyed it.

Malicious actors are offering downloads of the PC version of The Last of Us, which isn’t slated to come out until March 2023, and The Last of Us Part II, which has not been confirmed for the PC. Instead of the game, victims will unknowingly download a malicious file, which “can hide on the computer undetected for years – you will not know that something is wrong because it may not cause any visible harm, it will just silently do its job,” said Kaspersky. “After watching The Last of Us, many viewers will definitely want to play this game and control the actions of their favorite characters themselves. But if they haven’t been fans of this game series before, they are unlikely to know that The Last of Us is exclusive to PlayStation,” Kaspersky said. “Cybercriminals are actively exploiting the public’s lack of awareness.” Before the PC version was announced, the series was previously an exclusive for the PlayStation platform, with the original version coming out in 2013 for the PS3. Another infection vector the researchers discovered was a phishing site offering an activation code for the game. The firm described the process: “To download the file with the code, users are asked to choose one of the “gifts” that they will receive together with the game: for example, to get a brand-new PlayStation 5 or $100 Roblox Gift Card. However, after that users are told to enter their credentials and bank card data to pay the commission fee. In fact, by giving their data to the scammers, fans will have money stolen and will be left with nothing, while their personal data will later be used in other fraud schemes.” Below is a screenshot of one site offering a download of the game: Kaspersky expert Olga Svistunova explained that scams relating to the series may continue to proliferate throughout the year, given its popularity: “The Last of Us will be a real boom in early 2023, considering how many years millions of fans have been waiting for the series. Curiously, now instead of offering pre-access to the series, cybercriminals have chosen a different path and are distributing malicious files under the guise of a game. This shows that gamers, especially the new ones who don’t yet know enough about cybersecurity when playing, are among the main target audience for cybercriminals, and they will come up with more and more ways to exploit them.” To avoid being a victim, the firm recommended the avoidance of links promising early viewings of the show, checking the authenticity of a site that asks for credentials carefully, paying attention to the extensions of files being downloaded as a video file will never have a .exe or .msi file extension, and using trsuted security solutions. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/science/discoveries-inventions/laser-lightning-rod/,[],"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – When Benjamin Franklin fashioned the first lightning rod in the 1750s following his famous experiment flying a kite with a key attached during a thunderstorm, the American inventor had no way of knowing this would remain the state of the art for centuries. Scientists now are moving to improve on that 18th century innovation with 21st century technology – a system employing a high-powered laser that may revolutionize lightning protection. Researchers said on Monday, January 16, they succeeded in using a laser aimed at the sky from atop Mount Santis in northeastern Switzerland to divert lightning strikes. With further development, this Laser Lightning Rod could safeguard critical infrastructure including power stations, airports, wind farms and launchpads. Lightning inflicts billions of dollars in damage on buildings, communication systems, power lines and electrical equipment annually while also killing thousands of people. The equipment was hauled to the mountaintop at an altitude of about 8,200 feet (2,500 meters), some parts using a gondola and others by helicopter, and was focused on the sky above a 400-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) transmission tower belonging to telecommunications provider Swisscom, one of Europe’s structures most affected by lightning. In experiments during two months in 2021, intense laser pulses – 1,000 times per second – were emitted to redirect lightning strikes. All four strikes while the system was active were successfully intercepted. In the first instance, the researchers used two high-speed cameras to record the redirection of the lightning’s path by more than 160 feet (50 meters). Three others were documented with different data. “We demonstrate for the first time that a laser can be used to guide natural lightning,” said physicist Aurelien Houard of Ecole Polytechnique’s Laboratory of Applied Optics in France, coordinator of the Laser Lightning Rod project and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Photonics. Lightning is a high-voltage electrical discharge between a cloud and the ground, within a cloud or between clouds. “An intense laser can generate on its path long columns of plasmas in the atmosphere with electrons, ions and hot air molecules,” Houard said, referring to positively charged particles called ions and negatively charged particles called electrons. “We have shown here that these plasma columns can act as a guide for lightning,” Houard added. “It is important because it is the first step toward a laser-based lightning protection that could virtually reach a height of hundreds of meters (yards) or a kilometer (0.6 mile) with sufficient laser energy.” The laser device is the size of a large car and weighs more than 3 tons. It uses lasers from German industrial machine manufacturing company Trumpf Group. With University of Geneva scientists also playing a key role, the experiments were conducted in collaboration with aerospace company ArianeGroup, a European joint venture between Airbus and Safran. This concept, first proposed in the 1970s, has worked in laboratory conditions, but until now not in the field. Lightning rods, dating back to Franklin’s time, are metal rods atop buildings, connected to the ground with a wire, that conduct electric charges lightning strikes harmlessly into the ground. Their limitations include protecting only a small area. Houard anticipated that 10 to 15 years more work would be needed before the Laser Lightning Rod can enter common use. One concern is avoiding interference with airplanes in flight. In fact, air traffic in the area was halted when the researchers used the laser. “Indeed, there is a potential issue using the system with air traffic in the area because the laser could harm the eyes of the pilot if he crosses the laser beam and looks down,” Houard said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/guide-siem-reap-cambodia-vacation-what-you-need-to-know/,[],"Siem Reap is the second biggest city in Cambodia after the capital Phnom Penh. Siem Reap may not be Cambodia’s capital, but it draws thousands of tourists every year. Its biggest attraction is the famous and stunning Angkor Wat. The latter is an ancient complex that King Suryavarman II had built centuries ago. The complex covers just over 160 acres and was originally a Hindu place of worship before its transformation as a Buddhist temple in the late 12th century. There are also other noteworthy temple ruins near or around Siem Reap such as Bayon, Ta Prohm, Ta Som, and others. Since Cambodia is part of ASEAN, Filipinos can enter the country and visit Siem Reap visa-free. Filipinos can stay for 30 days. If you plan on staying longer, you’ll need to apply for a visa extension. By plane and bus combo There used to be direct flights from Manila to Siem Reap. During my first trip to Cambodia some years ago, I booked flight tickets directly to Siem Reap. This is no longer possible. Only Philippine Airlines (PAL) has direct flights to Phnom Penh. These aren’t everyday so you have to check the schedules when you plan. From Phnom Penh you can take a bus to Siem Reap; the trip takes around six hours and costs anywhere between $11 to $17 depending on the company. By plane You could include Siem Reap as part of a longer trip around Southeast Asia. There are regular flights from major cities in the region such as Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City. Book tickets in advance to get discounted prices. By land Via Bangkok If you’re already in Bangkok, you can travel by land to reach Siem Reap. There are buses that can take you across the border of Thailand into Cambodia. The trip can take around 8 hours or longer depending on traffic and how fast you cross the border from either side. Prices are around $35-$40 one way. Book at least a day before your planned departure. Via Ho Chi Minh City If you’re in Ho Chi Minh City, you can take a bus to Siem Reap. The trip can take 10 hours or longer. This costs around $25. The easiest way to explore Siem Reap is to hire a tuktuk and driver. The drivers can act as guides to tell you something about the temple you’re seeing but the experience they provide you isn’t the same as hiring an actual guide. A full day rental costs around $25+++ depending on the number of places you visit. You’ll save more money if you share the ride with other people. You could also book tours through sites such as Klook, Viator, or GetYourGuide. Most of the attractions in Siem Reap revolve around Angkor Wat and temple ruins. It takes at least three days to see the major ones including Angkor Wat. *This itinerary assumes you start with one full day. Day 1 Start early with a sunrise stop at one of Angkor Wat’s viewing points. FYI: there’s going to be a lot of people here during this time. Angkor Wat is the premier attraction of Siem Reap. This centuries-old complex is huge; both its exterior and interior are fascinating, with statues, bas-relief murals, and structures left in a ruinous state. You could spend an entire day exploring, but you’d want to move on to other temples. The usual additions after a visit to Angkor Wat include the Bayon Temple, Ta Prohm, Terrace of the Leper King, Terrace of the Elephants, Baphuon Temple, and Phimeanakas. After Angkor Wat, Bayon is often cited as a highlight. Bayon’s most distinguishing features are the numerous smiling stone faces that are likely a mix of King Jayavarman or Avalokiteśvara. The galleries in the temple complex depict historical and mythical events, and everyday life of the locals. Another noteworthy stop in your itinerary is Ta Prohm, made famous by Angelina Jolie’s Tomb Raider. Jayavarman VII had the Rajavihara (aka Ta Prohm) built centuries ago. He had it built to honor his family. The site used to be home to more than 10,000 people. The most distinctive feature of this attraction is the roots growing out of some parts of the ruins. Day 2 For your second day, go on another round of temple hopping to learn more about Cambodia’s ancient history. This circuit includes Banteay Srei, Preah Khan, Ta Som, Neak Pean, East Mebon, and Pre Rup. You’ll most likely start with the furthest of the group, which is Banteay Srei. The latter dates to the 10th century and is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. In my opinion, Banteay Srei is the most beautiful temple complex in Siem Reap. The distinctly reddish hue and elaborate and intricate carvings on the structures add to its splendor. King Jayavarman VII dedicated Ta Som temple to his father who was the Khmer King from 1150 to 1160. The temple finished construction in the 12th century. Pre Rup is another Hindu temple constructed as the Khmer King Rajendravarman’s state temple. Preah Khan is another 12th century temple that King Jayavarman VII had built for his father. Day 3 Set aside another day of temple hopping, this time to Beng Mealea, which is a few hours away from Siem Reap. I would recommend a trip here if you’re interested in ancient history. The complex has gained popularity over the years, but still doesn’t see the same number of tourists as the more famous Angkor Wat. Beng Mealea retained its jungle-like appearance despite maintenance works on the ruins. You’ll find a mix of Hindu and Buddhist influence when you explore the complex. You can clamber over the blocks and get overlooking views of the ruins. Tour packages would usually include other stops with Beng Mealea such as Koh Ker, Kulen Mountain, or Tonle Sap. You could also book a tour with just Beng Mealea as your destination. Day 4 By this time, you’re probably “templed out.” You could spend the day visiting some museums in the city such as the Angkor National Museum, Cambodia Landmine Museum, and the War Museum Cambodia. You could also just spend the day souvenir shopping or eating at a café or restaurant before leaving for your next destination. You’ll most likely end all three days or at some point during the day in or around Pub Street. The latter is where you’ll find the city’s bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist-oriented establishments. The tour you booked or the tuktuk and driver you hired will take you to a lunch stop during your day excursions. You might need to pay for your own lunch depending on the package you got. The US dollar is widely used and circulated in Cambodia. You can use it to pay for temple passes, accommodation, food, and drinks in many establishments. The pass for the temple ruins is your biggest expense. A day pass costs $37, a 3-day pass costs $62, and a 7-day pass costs $72. For the itinerary mentioned above, you’ll need a 3-day pass. You’ll spend an average of $75 a day during your stay in Siem Reap. This includes 3 days of temple hopping and maximizing the pass you bought, staying in a hostel dorm room (it’s really cheap in Siem Reap; you can get a bed for roughly $6 a night), hire a private tuktuk with driver every day, book a day trip to Beng Mealea and other attractions, and dine out a few times. You could spend less if you find a group to share expenses with for your tuktuk ride to the temples or just get a one-day pass to see Angkor Wat and nearby temples. Siem Reap is the most expensive part of your trip if you decide to stay longer in Cambodia. Travel tips – Rappler.com"

Tatum shot 15-for-23 from the field, making seven 3-pointers, and connected on all 14 of his free-throw attempts. He holds the franchise record for regular-season games with 50 or more points at five. Derrick White had 19 points and Malcolm Brogdon provided all 16 of his points in the first half. Marcus Smart added 10 points. Boston, which won its seventh game in a row, led by 17 points in the first half, but that margin was down to 100-98 with about nine minutes left. The Celtics’ 20-for-43 shooting on 3-pointers was too much for Charlotte to handle, though. Jalen McDaniels pumped in a career-high 26 points and LaMelo Ball poured in 25 for the Hornets. Mason Plumlee scored 19 points, P.J. Washington added 17 points and Terry Rozier finished with 14. The Celtics completed a sweep in Charlotte after winning 122-106 on Saturday night. Monday’s meeting had some elements that were similar, with Boston’s long-range shooting and Brogdon’s boost from the bench. But the Celtics had to work down the stretch. Boston’s 7-0 run increased its lead to 110-101, beginning with Tatum’s layup. The lead swelled to 121-110 on a pair of Tatum free throws and White’s basket off a drive. Tatum’s 3-pointers with 1:04 and 38 seconds remaining added to his late-game blitz. He also finished with nine rebounds and five assists while playing 40 minutes. The Celtics were 24-for-25 on free throws. Boston led 66-55 at halftime, hitting 10 shots from 3-point range by then. McDaniels made five of Charlotte’s 13 baskets from 3-point range. His previous career-high mark was 24 points in November, also against Boston. Ball also hit five treys. Charlotte ended up with only five turnovers and made 23 of 30 free throws, but the inability to defend the perimeter proved costly. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/european-union-envoys-urges-wider-public-consultations-barmm/,[],"COTABATO City, Philippines – European Union (EU) Ambassador to the Philippines Luc Veron urged Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao officials to hold more extensive public consultations on the BARMM electoral and local government codes. Veron on Monday, January 16, noted that the Bangsamoro was at a crucial stage in its legislative process as its interim officials stepped up work on the special region’s electoral and local government codes, and that wider consultations with marginalized and vulnerable groups in the predominantly Muslim region would enrich the process. Veron came over to lead the turnover of equipment, including mini-buses, which were given to BARMM as part of the Support to Bangsamoro Transition (Subatra) program, a five-year initiative funded by the EU and co-financed by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation. The program aims to support the smooth transition of the region through capacity-building efforts for the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Bangsamoro government, as well as civil society organizations. Veron told BARMM officials, “We hope that more people will be reached, especially those in the remote areas of the region, more voices heard, information widely disseminated, and public service is made more known and efficiently delivered.” He said the EU was confident that after the transition period, a more responsive and capacitated Bangsamoro government would enliven the principles of democratic and inclusive governance as provided in the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL). The 2018 law created the BARMM, which replaced the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), as part of a peace settlement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) which fought for greater autonomy in the Muslim-majority region in Mindanao. BARMM interim Chief Minister Ahod Balawag “Murad” Ebrahim said the European aid served as a “symbol of our mutual trust, and strengthened our collaboration as we approach the fulfillment of the transition period of the BARMM government.” BARMM Deputy Speaker Omar Yasser Sema said the regional government will use the EU donations to reach out to stakeholders and gather their views and inputs before the Bangsamoro holds its first regional elections in 2025. Newly-appointed Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who also came over, renewed his commitment to the Bangsamoro peace process and the region’s transition period. “Though I will now serve as the defense secretary, the peace process will always remain close to my heart. I promise to the chief minister and all members of parliament that I will dedicate the rest of my life to achieving peace in the Bangsamoro. It is my commitment and an eternal one,” he said. Galvez said he continues to be the presidential adviser for peace, reconciliation, and unity while heading the defense department. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/how-philippine-tourism-hinge-return-chinese-visitors-2023/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine tourism industry still has a long way to go before hitting pre-pandemic levels – but the return of Chinese visitors in the hundreds of thousands may just help us get there faster. Countries all over the world are already welcoming Chinese visitors back with open arms. Hotels in Singapore have prepared packages for Chinese visitors who will be there to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, a Japanese tour bus firm has similarly readied the revival of its Chinese-language tour. The Philippines has big plans, too. The Department of Tourism (DOT) warmed up to the Chinese market during the three-day state visit of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to China. The DOT and its counterpart China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism signed an implementation program on tourism cooperation between China and the Philippines. The deal promotes “bilateral tourism cooperation” between the two countries in an effort to revive an industry waylaid by the pandemic. Even before the deal, Philippine tourism was already picking up. In a press release on January 2, the DOT said that it logged 2.65 million international visitor arrivals in 2022, well above the department’s target. That, of course, also meant a boost in tourism revenue. That year, travelers brought in P208.96 billion – a more than 2,000% jump from the same period in 2021. But remember, the pandemic was still very much ravaging the world in 2021, so using figures in that year as a benchmark may paint a deceptively rosy picture. See in this line graph just how far we’ve fallen from our pre-pandemic tourism levels. To be clear, it was not just Philippine tourism that took a beating during the pandemic. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourism suffered its worst crisis in history at the peak of COVID-19 in 2020, with international arrivals dropping by 74%. Since then, global tourism has speedily recovered up to 65% of its pre-pandemic levels. However, the number of arrivals in Asia and the Pacific has lagged, according to UNWTO. This is where the crucial role of China comes in. China, among the biggest tourist markets for countries in the region, kept its borders mostly shuttered. But that was all set to change when in late 2022, China made a surprise U-turn on its strict zero-COVID policy. Already, Asian countries are preparing for an influx of Chinese tourists. Among them is the Philippines, which has consistently counted China among its top 3 tourist markets. (READ: Asia’s tourist hotspots prepare for boom as China relaxes COVID-19 rules) Before understanding why international arrivals from China are so integral to our tourism industry, we first need to take a deeper look at the people who came to the country in 2022. Since the Philippines reopened its borders to travelers on February 15, 2022, it welcomed visitors from nearly every country. Here’s a map visualizing all Philippine-bound international arrivals in 2022, with data coming from the DOT’s monitoring of arrivals from February to December 2022. In the map below, international arrivals are grouped by nationality, with their respective origin region shaded to represent the number of visitors coming from their area. Hover over the map to see specific numbers. Returning overseas Filipinos comprised the majority of international arrivals in 2022, with 628,445 making the journey home. The rest of the 2.02 million arrivals consisted of foreign tourists, with American and South Korean visitors accounting for almost half of all tourist arrivals. Here’s the breakdown of the country’s top 10 tourist markets: Comparing the top 10 tourist markets in 2022 to pre-pandemic years, what immediately sticks out is the massive drop in international arrivals from China. China, along with the US and South Korea, has traditionally been among the top three foreign tourist markets in the Philippines. And while tourists from the US and South Korea have already started trickling back into the country, the number of international arrivals from China has been limited, dropping to 10th place. Take a look at how the country's top tourist markets have changed from 2010 to 2022, and keep an eye on how international arrivals from China have steadily grown – only to crash following the pandemic. Recovery has been slow in large part due to President Xi Jinping's strict zero-COVID policy, which has restricted the movement of people and production in factories. For instance, in the first half of 2022, China began hard lockdowns in Shanghai. Bankers and traders in the bustling city's financial districts slept in offices and lived off instant noodles to keep the country's financial markets turning. Snap lockdowns of buildings, routine mass PCR testing, and mandatory quarantines kept Chinese citizens on their toes for most of the year. This extended to travel restrictions outside the country as well. China required returning travelers to have seven days of centralized quarantine along with three days of self-isolation. Travelers also had to go through a combination of PCR and antigen tests, on top of also securing a ""health code"" from the local embassy. This has all worked to discourage Chinese citizens from traveling at all, except for the most pressing of business – never mind for mere sightseeing. Recently, this has begun to change as President Xi committed to a full reopening of his country’s borders. Quarantine requirements for returning travelers were removed while China also resumed issuing passports and travel visas for mainland residents. (READ: China reopens borders in final farewell to zero-COVID) The Philippines is banking on cash-rich Chinese visitors to bolster its tourism industry. And it seems that in the case of Boracay – with its glittering sand – China is eager to oblige. The Chinese ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xillian already met with Aklan officials and business groups on January 9, just as Boracay prepares to welcome back its biggest tourist market. “We talked about the possibility of the return of Chinese tourists soon. We are happy about his visit,” Malay Mayor Floribar Bautista said in a phone interview with Rappler. Pre-pandemic, Chinese tourists had dominated arrivals in Boracay. Nearly 150,000 Chinese visitors came to the island in 2018, with the number of tourists growing by only 46% the following year. “There used to be 20-plus direct flights from China per week and almost 400,000 tourists yearly to Boracay before the pandemic. China is opening up again for international travel, and anticipates more Chinese outbound tourists later this year,” said the ambassador. The DOT has also laid the groundwork for a wider revival of warm tourism ties with the Implementation Program signed during the President's recent state visit. “This implementation program with China will generate massive employment opportunities and investments across all sectors of tourism throughout the Philippines,"" Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco said in a statement. The deal broadly gives assurances that the two countries will mutually support development of their hotels, resorts, cruise, port, tourism products, and competency standards. Joint workshops and training sessions for cruise and port development, lake development, tourism security measures, tourism market and industry research are also in the works. ""Our governments will work together on increasing tourist arrivals, resuming and adding direct flights to key and emerging destinations, joint promotional activities, and inviting tourism investments in infrastructure, among others,” Frasco emphasized. Both countries are also expected to support the other's travel fairs and tourism expeditions, with a renewed awareness about environmental protection and sustainable development. “Among the salient points of this Implementation Program is to advocate the best practices and knowledge in sustainable tourism which includes the promotion of eco-friendly products and services,"" the tourism chief said, adding that both governments would also encourage investments in tourism infrastructure. However, China's recent COVID-19 surge threatens to hurt tourism before it even begins its recovery. Japan, South Korea, the US, and Canada have all increased restrictions on arrivals from China, such as requiring pre-departure or arrival COVID-19 tests and limiting flights. For many tourist hot spots, the choice has become a delicate balancing act between economic recovery and pandemic safety. Chinese tourists represented the world’s largest outbound travel market in 2019. In the same year, Chinese tourists contributed $2.33 billion of the $9.31 billion in Philippine tourism revenue. Setting stricter quarantine measures could mean losing out on billions in revenue, should tourists be dismayed. That in mind, countries have made varied adjustments to their health protocols. For instance, Thailand has been quick to remove vaccination requirements for inbound travelers ahead of an expected rush of Chinese tourists. Australia and Germany have also said they would not impose additional requirements for Chinese travel. The US, on the other hand, has required COVID-19 tests on travelers from China. Currently, travelers arriving in the Philippines are only required to present a negative COVID-19 test if they are partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. Despite reporting on January 4 that eight unvaccinated Filipinos from China tested positive for COVID-19, the Department of Health does not yet see the need to tighten travel restrictions on arrivals from China. Nevertheless, Frasco was optimistic that the reopening of the country and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions would allow the tourism industry to further recover in 2023. She added that the DOT is aiming for 4.8 million international arrivals as its baseline target for 2023. “In the recent past, we have overcome a global pandemic, survived various calamities, and thrived throughout a host of many other challenges, yet, the Philippine tourism industry has managed to exceed expectations and our tourism partners and frontliners continue to offer the best of Filipino grace and hospitality to the world,” said the tourism chief in a New Year’s Eve message. – Rappler.com"

The nine consecutive rainstorms that inundated California in succession since December 26 killed at least 20 people while tens of thousands remained under evacuation orders as of Monday, Governor Gavin Newsom said in an executive order that reinforced the state’s response to storm damage. “The last of the heavier rain in California is slowly fading. After midnight it shouldn’t be heavy anymore,” said meteorologist David Roth of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. Biden will travel to areas of the central coast on Thursday to meet first responders, visit affected towns, and “assess what additional federal support is needed,” the White House said. The president had already issued an emergency declaration on January 8 to free up federal aid and then on Saturday authorized disaster assistance for Merced, Sacramento and Santa Cruz counties. The White House has yet to reveal the areas Biden will visit. Among the more dramatic images of storm damage were those of Highway 1, the scenic coastal highway near Big Sur, which was closed at several points due to mudslides and falling boulders strewn across the road. While damaging, the storms also helped mitigate a historic drought, as much of the state has already received half or more its average annual rainfall. But with more than two months to go in the rainy season, officials are urging Californians to continue conserving water. The US Drought Monitor still shows almost the entire state under moderate or severe drought conditions. Reservoir levels were still below average for this time of year, officials said. Moreover, the atmospheric rivers largely failed to reach the Colorado River basin, a critical source of southern California’s water. “If you rely on the Colorado River basin as a part of your water supply, then there will be continuing drought problems due to the extreme drought in that part of the world,” Michael Anderson, California’s state climatologist, told reporters. The Colorado’s two major reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, were at 28.5% and 22.6% of capacity, respectively, and still below levels from this time a year ago according to Water-Data.com. The ninth consecutive atmospheric river fizzled out on Monday, its remnants soaking the southernmost part of the state, Arizona and northern Mexico, Roth said. The storms are akin to rivers in the sky that carry moisture from the Earth’s tropics to higher latitudes, dumping massive amounts of rain. Another storm was coming that could bring moderate rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.S. National Weather Service said it lacked the volume to be classified as an atmospheric river, while the state Department of Water Resources said it may briefly qualify as one. California can otherwise expect dry conditions for the remainder of January, state officials said. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/filipinos-online-reactions-bureau-customs-philippine-airlines-crew-smuggling-onions/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Many social media users and some lawmakers have lambasted the Bureau of Customs (BOC) for supposedly nitpicking on Philippine Airlines (PAL) crew members who brought in 40 kilos of undeclared onions and fruits when the agency should be focusing on running after large-scale smugglers instead. On January 10, the BOC confiscated from 10 PAL crew over 15 kilos of onions, over four kilos of lemons, and a kilo of strawberries and blueberries. The incident drew outrage from netizens who questioned the alleged “double standard” of the BOC when it came to the implementation of the law against smuggling. Some government officials, including senators Raffy Tulfo and JV Ejercito, found it unnecessary to charge the airline crew. Tulfo said there was no need for the BOC to humiliate the PAL crew since the goods they brought in were to be considered pasalubong or a gift to their families. He added that the BOC must focus on catching big-time smugglers instead. Ejercito, for his part, questioned the BOC’s seeming misplaced priorities when it came to smuggling. Another social media user suggested that the incident may be used as a “smokescreen” that big-time smugglers would benefit from. Netizen Robbie Meriales saw the situation as a result of the government’s failure to address the basic needs of Filipinos, which includes reining in the price hike of onions. Netizen Elly called the country’s situation as the “golden onion era” under the Marcos administration. User @coconut_block suggested that bringing home onions as pasalubong illustrated the “desperate times” Filipinos were in. Others shared the view that the airline crew brought in goods that were not in “commercial quantity.” Another netizen questioned the motive of the agency. “May balak ba silang mapuri ng amo nila?” (Are they brownnosing their boss?)” he asked. Another netizen expressed support for the airline crew and for OFWs who “would rather bring home onions” especially in this economy. A netizen joined others in calling out the government for its supposed inconsistencies in dealing with smuggling cases. Vergel Zaragoza considered it “too technical” for the Bureau of Customs to require clearance from the Department of Agriculture before allowing the entry of goods for “personal use.” “When do you consider it smuggling?” another netizen asked. Others expressed frustration by using the phrase, “Sa Pilipinas lang (Only in the Philippines).” In a GMA Balitanghali interview, Customs spokesman Arnold Dela Torre cited Presidential Decree 1433, also known as the Plant Quarantine Decree of 1978. This law states that the entry of regulated commodities, particularly agricultural products from abroad, is not allowed in order to “protect domestic agricultural products from pests, bacteria and viruses.” According to Dela Torre, this is not the first time they encountered returning Filipinos bringing in agricultural products from abroad.  He added that the PAL crew failed to declare the goods. What are your thoughts on this? – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/fish-kill-lake-sebu-tilapia-raisers-lose-millions-january-2023/,[],"GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – Lake Sebu’s fish pen operators have so far incurred losses of at least P10 million when their tilapia cages at the scenic lake in South Cotabato were hit by fish kill. Over 140 tons of tilapia have been lost as a result of the January 12 fish kill – called “kamahong” in the T’boli tribe – just two weeks after a similar incident affected two villages in the area. Deputy lake warden Jose Rudy Muyco blamed the ongoing bad weather for the phenomenon. He said the lack of sunlight is aggravating the situation in the lake, which environmentalists and experts consider as a dying lake. Muyco noted that the lake needs photosynthesis to thrive, a process that benefits not only tilapia and other fish, but also plants and algae in the lake. He also explained that kamahong occurs when dissolved oxygen is depleted in the more than 350-hectare Lake Sebu. The ongoing kamahong has affected 143 fish pen operators with 1,340 fish cages, around 30% of the total number in the lake. These fish cages account for 1,530 loads of fingerlings worth around P2 million. Muyco warned that the situation may worsen if the weather does not improve, with dead fish floating all over the lake. The fish cages near the town center have been hit the hardest. Many in Lake Sebu rely on the tilapia trade and the domestic tourism industry, which is particularly popular at this time of year, according to Muyco. Lake Sebu is the largest of the three lakes in the town and home to more than 5,000 fish cages, mostly for tilapia, which occupy about a third of the lake’s area. Kamahong happens yearly, but it has become more frequent in recent years despite efforts to conserve the lake, according to Mayor Floro Gandam. In April 2022, kamahong affected tilapia raisers, resulting in P6 million in losses, Gandam said. The Provincial Development Council (PDC) in South Cotabato has proposed the creation of the Lake Sebu Development Authority, an autonomous body that would supervise and regulate economic activities within the lake. Sigfred Flaviano, provincial environment management officer, said that what Lake Sebu needs is a self-governing body with a mandate to oversee and manage environment programs that will ensure the conservation, protection, and development of the lake. About a decade ago, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) recommended the dismantling of the excess fish cages, but despite this move, the number increased. Experts see the overcrowding of fish cages as a major factor in the deterioration of the lake’s ecosystem, as it leads to more waste and debris from excess fish feeds settling at the lake’s bottom. Aside from kamahong, there have been fish kills in the past that were traced to increased levels of sulfur and other chemical wastes coming from the banks of the lake, which are mostly lined by resorts and houses. – Rappler.com"

Authorities responded early on Monday after multiple shots were heard. Some victims were found in the street while others were discovered in the house. One victim was alive and wounded when authorities arrived but later died at a hospital, Boudreaux said. The attacks occurred in Goshen, a farm community of 5,400 people about midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The bodies of the infant and 17-year-old mother were located in a ditch outside the home, Boudreaux later told the Los Angeles Times. Both had gunshot wounds to the head. Several others were shot in the head, including an elderly woman. Two women survived by hiding in a trailer on the property. “I think it’s specifically connected to the cartel. The level of violence … this was not your run-of-the-mill low-end gang member,” Boudreaux told the newspaper. “If (they) are specifically shooting everyone in the head, they know what they are doing … (and) they are comfortable with what they are doing.” The newspaper reported that last week’s search warrant resulted in one arrest and the seizure of guns, marijuana and methamphetamine. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/fact-vs-fiction-january-fiestas-philippines/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – The origins of Filipino fiestas are shrouded in mystery. Versions of origins and traditions have been mixed over time, veiling their true history. What myths and stories have been shared about the origins of fiestas, and which ones have been generally agreed upon as fact? There are two versions of the origins of Panay island’s Ati-Atihan. The first is the visit of 10 Bornean datus, led by a Datu Puti, by boat, arriving in Panay around the 13th century. These datus supposedly interacted with the indigenous Ati led by the chieftain Marikudo and his wife Maniwantiwan. The datus traded a golden salakot and other jewelry in exchange for land that the Ati inhabited. The Ati people struggled with famine due to a bad harvest. The datus provided food for them and in exchange, they danced and sang in gratitude. The festival, literally translating to “imitate the Ati people,” was supposedly a recreation of the celebrating Atis. This version has already been categorized as a myth, mainly due to Atis at the time being nomadic in nature, with no concept of a permanent residence needed for organized agriculture. The second version, written by a certain Fr. Jose Iturralde, claimed that an unnamed fisherman from Ibajay, Aklan in the 1700s had caught a piece of wood that turned out to be a carving of a child. The carving had given the fisherman and his family blessings, and following a priest’s advice, placed in the church. It however kept returning to the fisherman’s house. Seeing this as an interpretation of repentance, they blackened their faces and dressed in rags. The carving has since never left the church. Later on, a certain Fr. Fernando de Legaspi wanted to witness the festival in Ibajay but was caught by pirate Moros on the way. He was eventually freed and wanted to recreate the festival in Malinao, also in Aklan. The festival was likewise held in Kalibo when Legaspi was assigned there. According to Iturralde’s account, a testament was signed by Legaspi, along with businessmen and government officials in Kalibo on June 11, 1871, recognizing the annual Kalibo Ati-Atihan festival. There are multiple accounts of the origins of the Nazarene. In the past, people believed that the Nazarene got its darkened skin due to being burnt during its voyage to the Philippines, or due to the candle soot that was beneath it. This was already debunked, as the figure was made from mesquite, a type of dark wood similar to the local kamagong. It’s also commonly believed that the image arrived in the Philippines from Mexico in 1606, along with the first voyage of the Augustinians to the country. But according to anthropologist Fernando Zialcita in an interview with Lifestyle.Inq, he has yet to see documents that mention the exact date of the arrival of the Nazarene. It had definitely arrived sometime in the 17th century, as records show the recognition of the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene by Pope Innocent X in 1650. According to the website of Quiapo church, Manila Archbishop Basilio Sancho de Santas Justa y Rufina ordered the transfer of the image from its original location (in Bagumbayan) to the Quiapo church itself in 1767. The modern translacion retraces this journey annually. The original icon was destroyed during World War II. But the Augustinians, concerned about the wear and tear from the growing number of devotees, gave the Quiapo church a replica in the 1767 transfer. Then in the 1990s, a replica of the replica was commissioned to preserve the older copy. The task was undertaken by santero Gener Maglaqui, according to an Esquire article. The Nazarene paraded during the traslacion is a combination of the “original” replica body and the second replica’s head, while the one enshrined in the church is the second replica body with the “original” head. The Sinulog’s current form is owed to the popularity of the Ati-Atihan festival when parades began to be organized by David Odilao Jr. in 1980. Its origins go further back when newly-christened Rajah Humabon and his wife Hara Amihan were gifted the image of the child Jesus around 500 years ago. What is often contested is the origin of the dance or sinug, where multiple versions of the same legend appear. The first is from Humabon’s adviser (some say jester) Baladhay. When Baladhay fell ill, he was sent to rest in a room where the child Jesus was enshrined. Another account says that Hara Amihan (some accounts write Queen Juana, a Hispanic version of her name) placed the image where he was resting. After a while, they found Baladhay up and dancing, in a back-and-forth movement that we now recognize as the sinug. Others added that he was battling the image, as it had tickled him with a coconut midrib. Then-UP Cebu professor Madrileña dela Cerna wrote in a Cebu Daily News opinion article that the sinug was originally an ancient ritual that had survived Spanish colonialization. Cebuano dance researcher Caesar Nimor also clarified the difference between Sinulog and sinug, with Sinulog being the modern version of the traditional sinug dance. It was through Estilita “Nang Titang” Diola that the sinug dance was popularized and used during the festivities, though she was not the one who “invented” it. According to a Freeman article on Diola, she learned the dance from her father Turang and was the one who imparted the knowledge of the steps when the festival was organized in 1980. Myths and legends will continue to pervade fiestas, not because people no longer seek their real origins, but because they are ways through which devotion and wonder are strengthened and take inspiration from. – Rappler.com"

Microsoft said the startup’s tech, which it so far has previewed to its cloud-computing customers in a program it called the Azure OpenAI Service, was now generally available, a distinction that’s expected to bring a flood of new usage. The news comes as Microsoft has looked at adding to the $1 billion stake in OpenAI it announced in 2019, two people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. The news site Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft might invest $10 billion; Microsoft declined to comment on any potential deal. Public interest in OpenAI surged following its November release of ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command. ChatGPT is powered by generative artificial intelligence, which conjures new content after training on vast amounts of data – tech that Microsoft is letting more customers apply to use. ChatGPT itself, not just its underlying tech, will soon be available via Microsoft’s cloud, it said in a blog post. Microsoft said it is vetting customers’ applications to mitigate potential abuse of the software, and its filters can screen for harmful content users might input or the tech might produce. The business potential of such software has garnered massive venture-capital investment in startups producing it, at a time funding has otherwise dried up. Already, some companies have used the tech to create marketing content or demonstrate how it could negotiate a cable bill. Microsoft said CarMax, KPMG and others were using its Azure OpenAI service. Its press release quoted an Al Jazeera vice president as saying the service could help the news organization summarize and translate content. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-january-17-2023/,[],"Ukraine came a step closer on Tuesday, January 17, to winning the fleet of modern battle tanks it hopes could turn the course of the war against Russia, after the West’s big holdout Germany said this would be the first item on its new defense minister’s agenda. In the central city of Dnipro, authorities called an end to the search for survivors in the ruins of an apartment building destroyed during Russian missile attacks on Saturday. Forty-four people were confirmed killed and 20 still unaccounted for in the attack, the deadliest for civilians of a three-month Russian missile bombardment campaign. Seventy-nine people were wounded and 39 rescued from the rubble. Nearly 11 months after Russia invaded, Kyiv says a fleet of Western battle tanks would give its troops the mobile firepower to drive Russian troops out in decisive battles in 2023. German-made Leopard battle tanks, workhorse of armies across Europe, are widely seen as the only plausible option available in sufficient numbers. But they cannot be delivered without authorization from Berlin, which has so far demurred. With Western allies meeting at a US airbase in Germany on Friday to pledge military support for Ukraine, Berlin is under intense pressure to lift its objections this week, in what would be one of the most consequential shifts in Western aid so far. The decision sits on the desk of Germany’s new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, named on Tuesday to replace Christine Lambrecht, who quit after missteps including a cheerful New Year’s message about the war that opponents called tone deaf. “When the person, when the minister of defense, is declared, this is the first question to be decided concretely,” German Economy Minister Robert Habeck told Deutschlandfunk radio broadcaster on Tuesday, before the appointment was announced. In his first comments in the job, Pistorius, a regional politician, viewed as close to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, made no mention of weapons for Ukraine: “I know the importance of the task,” he said in a statement. “It is important to me to involve the soldiers closely and to take them with me.” He is due to host US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday ahead of Friday’s big meeting of allies at Ramstein air base. Germany has been cautious about approving weapons that could be seen as an escalation. But allies increasingly argue that concern is misplaced, with Russia showing no sign of backing down from its assault on its neighbor. Britain broke the taboo over heavy tanks over the weekend, pledging a squadron of its Challengers. But it has too few to form the basis of a Ukrainian force. Washington’s Abrams tanks run on turbine engines, seen as burning too much fuel for Ukraine to field in large numbers. That leaves the Leopards, which Germany made in the thousands during the Cold War and which are now fielded by armies across Europe. Poland and Finland have already said they would send Leopards if Berlin gives re-export approval. “We hope and are trying to organize bigger support for Ukraine. We hope a few partners, allies, will give tanks to Ukraine,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions driven from their homes since Russia launched what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine in February last year. Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops back during the second half of 2022, but over the past two months the front lines have largely been frozen in place despite both sides enduring heavy losses in relentless fighting. Ukrainian officials say tanks would be key to breaking the stalemate. Russia claims to have captured the small mining town of Soledar on the outskirts of the eastern city of Bakhmut last week. Kyiv has said it is still fighting there. “The situation is the same as yesterday. Our units are located in Soledar and are constantly hitting the enemy with fire,” Serhiy Cherevaty, a Ukrainian military spokesman, said. Moscow, meanwhile, has turned since October to a tactic of raining missiles down on Ukrainian cities far from the front, mainly targeting electricity infrastructure. Russia says it aims to reduce Ukraine’s ability to fight; Kyiv says the attacks serve no military purpose and are intended to harm civilians, a war crime. In Dnipro, residents left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial near the apartment block destroyed during Russia’s wave of missile attacks on Saturday. A soldier staggered away, wiping away tears, after laying flowers on the seat of a transport shelter turned into a temporary monument to the victims. A candle burned beside the growing pile of toys and bouquets. “We came here to look, pay our respects. It is very tough, such a shame about lives lost,” said 63-year-old Viktoria. Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians and blamed Ukraine’s air defenses for the missile that hit the apartment block. Kyiv says it was hit by a notoriously inaccurate Russian anti-ship missile for which Ukraine has no defenses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Monday night video address that the attack on Dnipro and Russia’s attempts to gain the initiative in the war underscored the need for the West “to speed up decision-making” in supplying weapons. Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, saying Kyiv’s close ties with the West created a security threat. Ukraine and its Western allies call it an unprovoked war to seize land and impose Russia’s will on its neighbor. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/gina-lollobrigida-italian-film-diva-dies/,[],"ROME, Italy – Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, a sultry Mediterranean diva who came to represent Italy’s vibrant rebirth after World War Two, has died aged 95, her former lawyer said on Monday, January 16. After a humble upbringing, Lollobrigida played opposite Hollywood stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra, becoming one of the most recognizable cinema icons of the 1950s and 60s. But she never clicked with the Hollywood studio system and her best known films remain those she made with Italian directors before and after her American parenthesis. “La Lollo”, as she was affectionately known in Italy, died in a Rome clinic, her former lawyer, Giulia Citani said. Lollobrigida became a photographer and sculptor after stepping away from the movie world. Last September, she failed in a bid to win a seat in the Italian parliament for a leftist political party at national elections. A spokesperson for Sophia Loren, a superstar diva in her own right in Italy’s heady post-war years, said Loren, 88, was “very shocked and saddened” by Lollobrigida’s death. “La Loren” and “La Lollo” had an ongoing rivalry in the 1950s and 1960, much of it encouraged, and some say even at least partly invented, by publicity agents. “Farewell to a diva of the big screen, protagonist of more than half a century of the Italian film history. Her charm will remain immortal. Ciao Lollo,” Italian culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano wrote on Twitter. When she stopped making films full-time, Lollobrigida developed new careers as a photographer and sculptor and was also a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and its Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Between 1972 and 1994 she published six books of her photographs, including Italia Mia (My Italy), The Philippines, and the Wonder of Innocence, photographs of and for children. In 1975, she made a documentary film Portrait of Fidel Castro, and for years there were rumors that she had had an affair with the Cuban leader. One of her last appearances was a cameo in an Italian film in 2011. In her later years, she spent much of her time divided between a secluded villa behind walls on Rome’s ancient Appian Way in the southern part of the Italian capital and the Tuscan artists’ colony of Pietrasanta, where she kept a sculptor’s studio. In an interview with Reuters in the Rome villa in 2006, she complained about intrusive photographers, saying they were still trying to invade her privacy. She had a one-woman show in Pietrasanta in 2008 and dedicated it to her friend, the late opera singer Maria Callas. When asked how she felt turning 90 in 2017, she said it was feeling like “30 plus 30 plus 30”. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/china-economy-gross-domestic-product-q4-2022/,[],"BEIJING, China – China’s economy is expected to have slowed sharply in the fourth quarter due to stringent COVID-19 curbs, dragging down 2022 growth to one of its worst in nearly half a century and raising pressure on policymakers to unveil more stimulus this year. Data on Tuesday, January 17, is forecast to show gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.8% in October-December from a year earlier, halving from the third-quarter’s 3.9% pace, according to a Reuters poll. Such an outcome would still exceed the second quarter’s 0.4% rate of expansion. On a quarterly basis, GDP is projected to contract 0.8% in the fourth quarter, compared with growth of 3.9% in July-September. “The Chinese economy appears to have ended the year on a weak tone,” economists at JPMorgan said in a research note. “As suggested by the weak December NBS PMI report, domestic activity likely slowed further by year-end as rapid relaxation of control measures led to a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases.” Beijing last month abruptly lifted its strict anti-virus measures that had severely restrained economic activity in 2022, but the relaxation has also led to a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases that economists say might hamper near term growth. Factory output is forecast to inch up 0.2% in December from a year earlier, slowing from a 2.2% rise in November, while retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, is seen shrinking 8.6% last month, extending November’s 5.9% drop. For 2022, GDP likely expanded 2.8%, badly missing the official target of “around” 5.5% and braking sharply from 8.4% growth in 2021. Excluding the 2.2% expansion after the initial COVID-19 hit in 2020, it would be the worst showing since 1976 – the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy. Growth is likely to rebound to 4.9% in 2023, as Chinese leaders move to tackle some key drags on growth – the “zero-COVID” policy and a severe property sector downturn, according to the poll. Most economists expect growth to pick up from the second quarter. The government is due to release the GDP data, along with December activity indicators, on Tuesday at 0200 GMT (10 am, Philippine time). Beijing’s abrupt lifting of COVID-19 curbs last month has prompted analysts’ upgrades of its economic outlook and a jump in Chinese financial markets, but businesses have struggled with surging infections, suggesting a bumpy recovery in the near term. Economists at Morgan Stanley expect an earlier and stronger growth recovery from the first quarter, lifting 2023 GDP growth to 5.7%. “We believe the market is still under-appreciating the far-reaching ramifications of reopening and the possibility that a decent cyclical recovery can occur despite lingering structural headwinds,” they said in a note. Chinese leaders have pledged to prioritize consumption expansion to support domestic demand this year, at a time when local exporters struggle in the wake of global recession risks. At an agenda-setting meeting in December, top leaders pledged to focus on stabilising the economy in 2023 and step up policy support to ensure key targets are hit. China is likely to aim for economic growth of at least 5% in 2023 to keep a lid on unemployment, policy sources said. The central bank is expected to steadily ease policy this year, pumping out more liquidity and lowering funding costs for businesses, while local governments are likely to issue more debt to fund infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com"

The European Commission is readying a charge sheet known as a statement of objections setting out its concerns about the deal which will be sent to Microsoft in the coming weeks, the people said.

Microsoft said: “We’re continuing to work with the European Commission to address any marketplace concerns. Our goal is to bring more games to more people, and this deal will further that goal.” The US software giant and Xbox maker announced the acquisition in January last year to help it compete better with leaders Tencent and Sony.

https://www.rappler.com/business/explainer-davos-2023-world-economic-forum/,[],"DAVOS, Switzerland – The World Economic Forum (WEF) returns to its snowy winter residency in the Swiss Alps this week with a record attendance of business and government leaders. Here’s the lowdown on Davos. The WEF’s roots stretch back to 1971 when its founder Klaus Schwab invited executives from European companies to the then tiny ski resort of Davos, high in the Swiss Alps. Schwab’s goal was to create a forum for policymakers and top corporate executives to address major global issues and learn best practices for leadership and management. Delegates, some with sought-after white badges which give greater access, attend panels and speeches inside the Congress Centre from Tuesday, January 17, through to Friday, January 20. Much of the action, however, occurs outside. Bilateral meetings between heads of state and corporate chieftains take up much of their schedules. On the main promenade of Davos, shop fronts and restaurants are taken over by companies and nations, becoming venues for parties and discussion panels that attract attendees and media. The most exclusive gatherings often occur well off the main drag at dinner parties, fireside chats, and cocktail receptions. More than 600 chief executive officers will be in town, including Wall Street executives such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, David Solomon from Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman. With climate change top of the agenda, chiefs of major energy companies are back after a COVID-related hiatus. Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the presidents of Spain, South Korea, Poland, and the Philippines are among 51 heads of state present. Another 56 finance ministers, 19 central bank governors, 30 trade ministers, and 35 foreign ministers are also due to make the journey up into the mountains. Idris Elba and Sabrina Dhowre Elba, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Renee Fleming, wil.i.am, and social media star Nas Daly are all attending. The Russians are absent, but Ukraine, which dominated last year’s summit, has another high-level delegation and several war-related sessions are on the agenda. Others include International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde, NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and central bankers such as India’s Raghuram Rajan are also on the list. Unclear is whether climate activist Greta Thunberg will return to the slopes. This year’s theme, “Cooperation in a Fragmented World,” is a nod to the tectonic shift in global markets and political relationships that has occurred since the pandemic. The annual event was once regarded as a cheerleader for globalization. Now, the global elite will meet against a backdrop of protectionism, a war that has strained political alliances, and deepening ideological divides. Rising interest rates and a cost-of-living crisis also threaten to divert attention to matters back home for some. Climate change topped the WEF’s survey of global risk and energy company executives will mix with climate activists and environment ministers at the forum. Other themes will include the cost of living, a tight labor market, natural disasters, and extreme weather events, how to prevent a global recession in 2023, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in many countries, an energy crunch, and the looming first anniversary of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The WEF is not without its detractors. In recent years, it has been criticized by activists and commentators as a talking shop for the jetset that just adds to global carbon emissions. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/italy-arrests-top-mafia-boss-messina-denaro-at-sicilian-hospital/,[],"PALERMO, Italy – Italy’s most wanted mafia boss, Matteo Messina Denaro, was arrested by armed police at a private hospital in Sicily on Monday, January 16, where the man who has been on the run since 1993 was being treated for cancer. Nicknamed “Diabolik” and “‘U Siccu” (The Skinny One), Messina Denaro had been sentenced in absentia to a life term for his role in the 1992 murders of anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, crimes that shocked the nation and sparked a crackdown on Cosa Nostra. Messina Denaro, 60, was led away from Palermo’s “La Maddalena” hospital by two uniformed carabinieri police and bundled into a waiting black minivan. He was wearing a brown fur-lined jacket, glasses and a brown and white woolly hat. Images on social media showed locals applauding and shaking hands with police in balaclavas as the minivan was driven away from the suburban hospital to a secret location. Judicial sources said he was being treated for cancer and had an operation last year, followed by a series of appointments under a false name. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed the arrest as “a great victory for the state”. Maria Falcone, sister of the murdered judge, echoed that sentiment. “It proves that mafiosi, despite their delusions of omnipotence, are ultimately doomed to defeat in the conflict with the democratic state,” she said. Messina Denaro, comes from the small town of Castelvetrano near Trapani in western Sicily, and is the son of a mafia boss. Police said last September that he was still able to issue commands relating to the way the mafia was run in the area around Trapani, his regional stronghold. Before he went into hiding, he was known for driving expensive cars and his taste for wearing finely tailored suits and Rolex watches. He faces a life sentence for his role in bomb attacks in Florence, Rome, and Milan that killed 10 people in 1993 and is accused by prosecutors of being solely or jointly responsible for numerous other murders in the 1990s. In 1993 he helped organize the kidnapping of a 12-year-old boy, Giuseppe Di Matteo, in an attempt to dissuade his father from giving evidence against the mafia, prosecutors say. The boy was held in captivity for two years before he was strangled and his body dissolved in acid. The arrest comes almost 30 years to the day since police arrested Salvatore “Toto” Riina, the Sicilian Mafia’s most powerful boss of the 20th century. He eventually died in jail in 2017, having never broken his code of silence. “It is an extraordinary event, of historic significance,” Gian Carlo Caselli, who was a prosecutor in Palermo at the time of Riina’s arrest. Experts say that Cosa Nostra has been replaced by the ‘Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, as the most powerful organized crime group in Italy. “There is a sense that the Sicilian Mafia is not as strong as it used to be, especially since the 90s, they have really been unable to enter the drug market and so they are really second-fiddle to the ‘Ndrangheta on that,” said Federico Varese, professor of criminology at Oxford University. – Rappler.com"

Major energy firms including BP, Chevron, and Saudi Aramco are among the 1,500 business leaders gathering for the annual meeting in the Swiss resort of Davos, where global threats including climate change are on the agenda. “We are demanding concrete and real climate action,” said Nicolas Siegrist, the 26-year-old organizer of the protest who also heads the Young Socialists party in Switzerland. The annual meeting of global business and political leaders opened in Davos on Monday, January 16. “They will be in the same room with state leaders and they will push for their interests,” Siegrist said of the involvement of energy companies during a demonstration attended by several hundred people on Sunday, January 15. The oil and gas industry has said that it needs to be part of the energy transition as fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in the world’s energy mix as countries shift to low carbon economies. On Monday, a social media campaign added to the pressure on oil and gas companies, by promoting a “cease and desist” notice sponsored by climate activists Thunberg, Vanessa Nakate, and Luisa Neubauer, through the nonprofit website Avaaz. It demands energy company CEOs “immediately stop opening any new oil, gas, or coal extraction sites, and stop blocking the clean energy transition we all so urgently need,” and threatens legal action and more protests if they fail to comply. The campaign, which had been signed by more than 660,000 people, had almost 200,000 shares on Monday morning. Sumant Sinha, who heads one of India’s largest renewable energy firms, said it would be good to include big oil companies in the transition debate as they have a vital role to play. “If oil people are part of these conversations to the extent that they are also committing to change then by all means. It is better to get them inside the tent than to have them outside the tent,” Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, told Reuters, saying that inclusion should not lead to “sabotage.” Rising interest rates have made it harder for renewable energy developments to attract financing, giving traditional players with deep pockets a competitive advantage. As delegates began to arrive in Davos, Debt for Climate activists protested at a private airport in eastern Switzerland, which they said would be used by some WEF attendees, and issued a statement calling for foreign debts of poorer countries to be canceled in order to accelerate the global energy transition. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/light-end-tunnel-sinulog-2023/,[],"CEBU, Philippines – The Sinulog 2023 festival at the South Road Properties (SRP) had to go through a myriad of problems and controversies before ending with a spectacular grand finale on Sunday, January 15. From preparation until the finish line, Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama stood pat: “One Cebu Island Sinulog 2023 will be at the SRP”. He remained firm even as Cebu Governor Gwendolyn, and residents pointed out that traffic issues, the lack of usable facilities, and the muddy terrain could worsen with rain. This is the first time the Sinulog Festival, done in honor of the Senior Santo Niño, was held at the SRP. In previous years, the Cebu City Sports Center hosted the Sinulog, drawing millions of people to the streets of the Visayas Queen City. The change in venue was followed by a ban on street parties that are a normal occurrence during the fiesta celebration. In past festivities, Osmeña Boulevard, the major thoroughfare in Cebu City, would be full of people as early as 7 am. That did not happen this year. Many Cebuanos felt almost like they were left in the dark, in suspense until the end of the celebration when P3-million-worth of fireworks lit up the sky and winners of the Sinulog Idol singing competition serenaded them. The Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CCDRRMO) said more than half a million people witnessed the entire event. In true Sinulog fashion, devotees, performers, and tourists battled through intense heat from the city center to the SRP World Tent City in City di Mare. The Cebu City government said there would be free bus rides from Plaza Independencia to the SM Seaside Cebu. However, attendees, even senior citizens, still needed to walk the length of 2,000 meters along the Cebu South Coastal Road (CSCR) from the drop-off point to City di Mare. Many attendees found that while the area was wide enough for large crowds, there weren’t enough restrooms nor enough tents for those seeking to be shielded from the sun. THE dancing contingents were not spared the blazing weather conditions as they performed their ritual festival dances. A total of 16 contingents competed in the Ritual Dance Showdown which had a Street Dance Category, and all their participants gave 100% despite the risk to their health. Officials assured residents that there would be ambulances and first-aiders standing by to assist attendees. Over 2,000 security personnel were deployed for Sinulog day. “You know, hosting the event first in SRP, you cannot really perfect the whole system…In fact, the traffic was also bad but at least at the end of the day, there is always room for improvement,” Cebu City Councilor Jerry Guardo, head of the committee on infrastructure that assisted the Sinulog 2023 executive committee, told Rappler. At around 11 am, heavy traffic buildup was reported along Mabini Street in downtown Cebu City. This consisted of motorcycles and cars traveling to Basilica Minore del Santo Niño de Cebu and the SRP. At the end of the day, Rama believes that “Senior Santo Niño has really done it”. More than 40 booths were able to operate at the newly established SRP World Tent City and tickets for the event were half the original rates back in 2020 , when prices started at P1,000. Many attendees were also able to take their pictures with celebrities like Jericho Rosales, Richard Gutierrez, Sue Ramirez, and more. There were also higantes (parade giants) and puppeteers that followed 40 floats during the grand parade. In the evening, as people waited patiently for the announcement of the Sinulog Festival Ritual Showdown winners a 15-minute fireworks display brought back memories of the previous Sinulog celebration in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic halted all in-person religious gatherings and festival activities for two years. At around 9 pm, the winners of the ritual showdown competition were announced. Omega de Salonera of Surigao del Norte bagged P1,000,000 for winning Best in Ritual Showdown (Free Interpretation). “We have to embrace the change because the new thing is now in SRP and by next year, we will continue to hold the activity here,” Cebu City Councilor Phillip Zafra, chairman of the Sinulog 2023 executive committee, told Rappler.

The Kings trailed by a point a halftime but gained control in a dominating third quarter after which they led by a dozen and never allowed San Antonio to get closer than four points in the final period. Sacramento has won four straight while the Spurs have dropped five consecutive games and eight of their past nine. De’Aaron Fox added 23 points for the Kings, with Davion Mitchell tallying 19 off the bench and Keegan Murray and Trey Lyles hitting for 12 each.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/nick-kyrgios-devastated-injury-forces-australian-open-pullout/,[],"Nick Kyrgios’s hopes of ending his country’s 47-year wait for a homegrown men’s champion at the Australian Open were shattered on the opening day on Monday, January 16, when he pulled out of the tournament with a knee injury. The 27-year-old was, in his opinion at least, going into the tournament as one of the favorites after reaching the Wimbledon final and the quarter-finals of the US Open last year. “I’m devastated obviously. It’s like my home tournament,” Kyrgios told reporters at Melbourne Park. “Honestly, I’m just exhausted from everything, and obviously pretty brutal. One of the most important tournaments of my career. It hasn’t been easy at all.” Kyrgios skipped the United Cup team competition at the start of the season and pulled out of his only warm-up tournament for the Australian Open in Adelaide. His physiotherapist Will Maher said Kyrgios had been troubled by a cyst on a small tear in the meniscus of his left knee for a couple of weeks and that withdrawing from the tournament was the sensible decision. “It’s not a significant injury in the sense that it’s going to be career threatening or anything like that,” Maher added. “The situation now is we wanted to prevent him from having further injury or making that injury worse. The prognosis is good and he’ll be fine. We just go back to work and make sure everything is fine for him and we go again.” Maher said Kyrgios would have surgery on the joint and thought he would recover in time to play at the Masters tournament at Indian Wells in California in early March. Kyrgios said there was a “constant throbbing” from the knee and that a hit with doubles partner Thanasi Kokkinakis on Monday morning convinced him he had to pull out. The withdrawal also means Kyrgios and Kokkinakis – dubbed the ‘Special Ks’ – will not be able to defend the men’s doubles title they won at Melbourne Park last year. “Obviously this coming around is just bad timing, but that’s life” Kyrgios added. “Injury is a part of the sport. I guess I can draw some inspiration from someone like Thanasi who has had a bunch of injuries and has bounced back. “Look, I’m not doubting I will be back to my full strength and playing the tennis I was playing prior to this event.” Kyrgios said he thought he had had a real shot at becoming the first Australian since Mark Edmondson in 1976 to win the men’s singles title. “We felt we had a genuine chance of winning an event, winning a Grand Slam and answering the questions,” he said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/sports/tennis-match-results-rafael-nadal-jack-draper-australian-open-january-16-2023/,[],"Defending champion Rafa Nadal dropped a set but prevailed in a battle of fitness against rising talent Jack Draper to reach the second round of the Australian Open on Monday, January 16, with an unconvincing 7-5, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 win. Fellow lefthander Draper played superbly to level the match at a set all on a warm and humid afternoon at Rod Laver Arena but the 21-year-old Briton was soon overwhelmed by cramping and bowed out groaning in pain. It was something of an escape for top seed Nadal, who came into the match with only one win since the US Open and was far from his best in a match that threw up unexpected challenges. “I need a victory, so that’s the main thing. Doesn’t matter the way,” Nadal, 36, told reporters. “I was humble enough to accept that (there were) going to be a little bit ups and downs during the match. Typical thing when you are not in a winning mood.” It was a far cry from Nadal’s last match at center court when he came back from two sets down to topple Daniil Medvedev in a classic final and claim his second Australian Open crown. Yet there was still some drama as, at 4-3 in the opening set, Nadal complained during the change of ends that a ballkid had made off with his racket. “I need the racket back,” he told the chair umpire. Using a spare, he failed to convert a break point in the next game before the missing racket was returned. Starting his bid for a record-extending 23rd Grand Slam title, Nadal had to shrug off 46 unforced errors to grind down world No. 38 Draper and set up his next match against American Mackenzie McDonald. Despite Draper’s troubles, the Briton broke Nadal in the first game of the fourth set when he swooped on an ambitious drop-shot to slot a winner into an open court. But Nadal went on to win the next six games in succession to claim the match as Draper’s cramping severely curtailed his movement. “Playing Grand Slam tennis, you’ve got to be out there, especially playing someone like Rafa, for hours and hours and hours,” said Draper, ruefully. “I feel like if you’re not cramping, then that’s fine. The pains of playing high-level tennis on the body is tough. But when you start cramping, it becomes almost impossible, in all honesty.” – Rappler.com"

Pero as ginikanan… siguro ko, naa pa na silay lawm nga giagian. (We are very thankful that we now have them, they have been surfaced. But, as a mother, I am sure that they are going through something much deeper still),” she said during the press briefer. Family and friends were able to reunite with them the morning of January 16, with aid from the administration of the University of the Philippines-Cebu. Prior to this, family and volunteers reportedly began negotiations for their release on the evening of Sunday, January 15. They did not provide the details of the UP-Cebu aid. According to Dennis Abarrientos of KARAPATAN – Central Visayas, this was when Gumanao and Dayoha were left at a resort in Carmen, a northern municipality of Cebu Province 42 kilometers away from Cebu City. They were retrieved from the same resort the following day. Speakers in the press conference refuse to divulge more details on the negotiation as of now. “Ang mahatag ra nato na detayle mao ang nakuha nato sila og balik, safely,” Regletto Imbong, President of the All UP Academic Employees Union-Cebu said. (The only detail we can give is that have retrieved them safely.) A video of the alleged abduction anonymously contributed to volunteers behind the movement to locate the two was played during the press conference. The clip shows men in plain clothes forcing persons believed to be Gumanao and Dayoha in a silver car. In the background, people, including the taker of the video, could be heard asking for help while authorities stood by. One of the persons being coerced to enter the vehicle could also be heard struggling to escape. “Naka sturya mi sa mga victims.

He did not mention what questions were asked. “During sa pila sila ka adlaw… gi detain… while gi interrogate sa separate na rooms. Dili na sila ka further pa sturya sa pagka-karon kung unsa ang nahitabo during the interrogation. Bag-o pa kaayo and sitwasyon, they are still processing unsa ang ilang mga experiences,” Abarrientos added. (They were detained, they were interrogated in separate rooms. They could not share more at the moment what transpired during the interrogation. It’s still so recent and they are still processing what they have experienced.) Danilo Gumanao, father of Dyan Gumanao, said the two reportedly attested that the men who seized them introduced themselves as police officers. “Based sa testimony sa victims, pag-arrest sa ilaha, didto pa lang sa pagbaba sa barko, direktang gipusasan sila nya, “ayaw na’g kuan kay pulis mi,” he said. (Based on the victims’ testimonies, they were handcuffed upon their arrest, after they departed from the boat. And [they were told], ‘don’t [fuss] because we are police.’) The Central Visayas Police Regional Office (PRO-7) sent a statement to Cebu media stating that they will lead probe on the case of Gumanao and Dayoha, requesting the cooperation of the two development workers  in the process. “[The regional director] of PRO- 7 immediately orders a deep, thorough, and impartial probe regarding the alleged abduction of Armand and Dyan. Their presence will fast-track the investigation and their blow-by-blow account of what transpired will shed light in determining the perpetrators. We request their cooperation with the investigation,” the statement read. “PRO- 7 assures transparency in the investigation and we shall immediately update the parties once we secure developments on this case,” the statement reads further. Gumanao and Dayoha’s families, friends and colleagues challenged the police not only to ensure a swift and impartial investigation of the case but also for accountability on the alleged abduction. This, they said, included what they described as the “inaction” of the Cebu Port Authority, the Maritime Police of Cebu, the Philippine Coast Guard of Central Visayas, and 2GO Group Inc. “Maayo na lang sa kaso nila Dyan, lapad kaayo ang network ug ang support… unsa na lang kaha ang mahitabo kung ang ordinary na kabus, trabahante og mag-uuma nga wala’y laing kasaligan,” Gumanao’s father said. (What’s fortunate in the case of Dyan is that their network is wide as well as the support. What would have happened if ordinary people, the poor, workers, or farmers were put in the same situation?) “Kami, bisan naan a ang among anak, kuyog kanamo, padayon gihapon among panawagan pagkondena sa maong binuhatan.

The local government said communities in at least 50 villages were hit by floodwaters and landslides, affecting more than 16,000 families or roughly 50,000 people. The rain, wrought by a low pressure area (LPA) that lingered off Surigao del Sur, pounded Zamboanga City for several days. The city saw the worst of the bad weather on Wednesday, January 11. The LPA has affected many other areas in Mindanao. As of Monday afternoon, it was located 180 kilometers east northeast of Surigao City, Surigao del Norte, or 245 kilometers east of Maasin City, Southern Leyte. In a statement, Zamboanga City Social Welfare and Development Officer Socorro Rojas said aid for flood-affected families not in evacuation centers would begin this week after lists submitted by barangay officials have been finalized. The initial relief operations focused on families who fled to evacuation centers, although Zamboanga City Mayor John Dalipe has already been leading workers in going to the villages to give families relief goods. Rojas said all flood-affected families, regardless if they were in evacuation centers or flood-damaged homes, would receive assistance from the government.

MANILA, Philippines – While onion imports driving down prices may sound like welcome news for consumers, it can be a matter of life and death for some farmers. In a Senate committee hearing on Monday, January 16, Merlita Gallardo shared the plight of onion farmers in Bayambang, Pangasinan. Her husband, who had helped their family run the farm, had taken his own life in 2021 after an armyworm infestation had destroyed their crops and left them buried in debt reaching into the millions. Gallardo had tried to soldier on, planting onions as she had in the past, but a series of storms in 2022 destroyed her crops. “Nalugi din po kasi nag-ulit na naman ako. Nag-ano na naman sa ‘min ‘yung ulan noong nag-ulit ako, kaya maliit pa rin ‘yung ibang sibuyas namin,” she said during the hearing conducted by the Senate committee on agriculture, food, and agrarian reform. (I lost money again because I had to replant. Then the rains came again after I had replanted, so our onions were still small.) After she had replanted onions, yet another challenge came – this time, it was man-made. The imminent arrival of cheap onion imports could drive prices down just as farmers begin their harvest season. “Ngayon pa lang po sila sana makabawi, pero dahil may importation po, wala pang 100 days ang kanilang onions, kailangan nang i-harvest, 85 to 90 days,” said Elvin Laceda, national president of Young Farmers Challenge Club of the Philippines, an organization that helped onion farmers like Gallardo. (They were on the way to recovery now, but because of importation, they had to harvest their onions before 100 days, just 85 to 90 days in.) “‘Yung storya ni Nanay, sana hindi na maulit sa ibang magsasaka. Limang magsasaka po ang nag-suicide po doon sa barangay nila,” Laceda said. (I hope her story is never repeated among other farmers. Five farmers in their village committed suicide.) “I am fully aware of onion farmers’ suicide not only in Pangasinan but even in Nueva Ecija, and in Pampanga, where the miserable prices of March and April barely paid for the cost of production, and yet here in Metro Manila, we haven’t been able to procure onions at a reasonable rate even despite the established SRP of P150, P250, and so on,” Senator Imee Marcos said during the hearing. (Editor’s Note: Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals caution against attributing suicide to any single reason or trigger. The act of suicide, they say, is always a confluence of factors, such as “the person’s psychological make-up, the stressors in one’s environment, and even genetic predispositions.” Economic hardships, for example, “may lead to an increased risk of suicide.”) Earlier in January, the Department of Agriculture (DA) had allowed the importation of 21,060 metric tons of onions in response to prices soaring far above the world average. However, the department clarified that, based on the number of sanitary and phytosanitary import clearances (SPSIC) applied, only about 5,000 metric tons of imports will be coming in. When asked why the DA had only permitted imports now that the harvest season was fast approaching, it said that, during dialogues held, farmers had asked not to allow imports. “Ito ‘yung first time na halos, ma’am, na hindi po talaga kami nag-issue dahil po ang comment po ng industry was meron pa pong supply.… ‘Yung concern ng farmers was if nag-issue kami ng SPSIC at that time ay babahiin ‘yung market,” said Assistant DA Secretary James Layug. (This was the first time that we issued almost none because of the comment from the industry that there was still supply…. The concern of the farmers was, if we issued SPSICs at that time, the market would become flooded.) The DA also said that it ramped up anti-smuggling efforts in September and October 2022. However, Romel Calingasan, the municipal agriculturist of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, said that if the government did see the need to import, it should have done so earlier in 2022. This would have eased prices at the market while also avoiding a clash with the local harvest season. “Dapat September pa lang, nag-issue na kayo ng importation permit para ‘yung presyo sa merkado, nagkaroon ng kalaban ‘yung local at ang imported. Pinagsamantalahan na patungan ng almost 1,000%. Tapos ngayon na mag-aani na si Juan na magsasaka, sasabayan ng importation,” Calingasan said. (You should have issued importation permits as early as September so that there would be a balance of forces between local and imported. They took advantage and tacked on almost 1,000%. And now that farmer Juan will be harvesting, [the government] also start importing.) Senators were convinced that the DA miscalculated the timing and necessity of imports. “Ilang buwan na din na mataas ang presyo ng sibuyas, pero nagmatigas ang DA noong Disyembre na wala daw importation na magaganap. Pero ngayon parang, joke lang, meron na pala,” Senator Grace Poe said during the hearing. (Prices for onions had been high for months, but the DA refused to import in December. But now, it’s as if they are saying, no, it was a joke, importation is now allowed.) Senator Koko Pimentel also questioned how the DA processed its data and arrived at its decisions. “Ang DA, with a hundred years of experience, with an honest-to-goodness dialogue with stakeholders, how do you process the information that you get?” he said. He asked the DA why the more than 10,000 metric tons of onions in cold storage was unable to meet the 2022 demand, an issue which the department said it was still investigating. An onion shortage is not the only problem the DA faces. Recently, prices of eggs have shot up by 45%. The country is also weathering shortages in salt and sugar.  In response to the issues constantly hounding the DA, Senator Poe questioned whether it was time to find a full-time agriculture secretary. “Panahon na rin siguro talaga na magkaroon ng DA secretary na aakop sa kawalan ng action sa agricultural crisis na ito. Asukal noong una; sibuyas naman ngayon. I-hehearing ata natin lahat ng kailangan sa kusina,” she said. (It’s probably time to have a DA secretary that will take over the lack of action in this agricultural crisis. Before it was sugar; now, it’s onions. We’ll end up having a hearing for everything in the kitchen.) President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has again left the country for his eighth foreign trip in seven months, currently sits as the department’s secretary. – Rappler.com The Department of Health, through the National Center for Mental Health, has a national crisis hotline to assist people with mental health concerns.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-response-ukraine-ambassador-comment-zelenskiy-meet/,['BEA CUPIN'],"MANILA, Philippines – Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. said his administration was “surprised” when an Ukraine diplomat said there was no response to a request for a meeting between him and embattled Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Marcos said they have responded to Ukraine’s query, but could not find a schedule for the proposed encounter. “There was talk of it a few months, a couple of months ago pero hindi na… walang napag-usapan (There was no talk). That’s why nagulat kami (we were surprised) when the special envoy came out and said na hindi pa sinasagot (we didn’t reply). Sinagot namin (We replied) but we didn’t get…  we couldn’t get it scheduled,” Marcos told reporters on Sunday, January 15, en route to Zurich, Switzerland to participate in the 2023 World Economic Forum (WEF). A transcript of the interview, held inside PR001 or the presidential plane, was released to the media early morning Monday, January 16. Denys Mykhailiuk, charges d’ affaires of the Ukrainian embassy in Malaysia, said in a virtual briefing on January 11 that Ukraine had been trying to reach Malacañang to arrange a meeting between the Philippine and Ukrainian leaders. But this went for naught. An undersecretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) would later say it was “not good diplomatic practice” for Mykhailiuk to “vent” via the media. “I have no problem with talking to President Zelenskiy, especially now that mainit na ang giyera doon sa kanila (war in Ukraine is at a critical point). So of course we are, again, on the side of peace and that remains the same. But any expressions of support that he might feel is needed, we are happy to provide it,” added Marcos. Zelenskiy has been leading the besieged Ukraine amid a Russian invasion. The Ukrainian leader has been courting support from different countries, specially for his proposed 10-point peace plan. Countries around the world have poured in billions of dollars into Ukraine for its defense and military resources. Yet reception to its 10-point peace plan has been decidedly more cautious, even from countries which have expressed explicit support for Kyiv. Marcos too was tentative when asked about the proposed peace plan. “That’s not for us to decide. Those details are for… should there be talks Ukraine and… between Ukraine and Russia, sila mag-uusap tungkol diyan (they should be the ones to talk). We support any effort towards peace, anything basta’t matigil ang patayan, matigil ang giyera. ‘Yun na muna. Tapos kung papaano nila gagawin (just so the killing ends, the war ends. That’s all that matters. As to how it happens), what will they do with the territories that have changed stance, et cetera. That is really clearly between the two countries,” said Marcos. Mykhailiuk told media that their request to meet with Marcos was first submitted in June 2022, or when the Philippine president began his term. Seven months into the Marcos administration a meeting has yet to happen. The Ukrainian envoy said they’d been regularly filing a formal request for an encounter between the two leaders. A Philippine diplomat on Thursday, January 12, said it was “not good diplomatic practice” for a Ukrainian diplomat to broadcast via the media his country’s apparent efforts to communicate with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. – efforts that have, thus far, apparently not been responded to. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA)’s Undersecretary Carlos Sorreta, speaking before Palace reporters about the comments of Mykhailiuk on Ukraine’s efforts to arrange a dialogue with Marcos, said: “Ukraine is a country we have a good relationship with but when matters like these are vented by representatives of another government through the press, it’s not something that we appreciate.” Marcos is in Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of the world’s political and business elite. Marcos said that he planned to present to businessmen and fellow world leaders his administration’s push to create a sovereign wealth fund – even if it has yet to even be tackled before the Senate. Ukraine – and the effect of Russia’s war on its economy – is expected to be a major topic at the WEF. Russia’s war in Ukraine has affected the supply chain of Ukrainian products, including those that countries around the world rely on for its food supply. Russia’s war has also affected world oil prices. – Rappler.com"

So when Christian Standhardinger’s name was called as the Finals MVP of the grueling seven-game series against the visiting Bay Area Dragons, more than 50,000 people celebrating with the Gin Kings at the massive Philippine Arena were left in a joyful state of shock – including the man himself. “I did not expect it. I was just sitting there, I started cramping up in the fourth quarter and just enjoyed the ride. Then I heard my name and I said, ‘Oh, wow.’ Then I jumped up there.” While Standhardinger and many Ginebra fans were stunned by the announcement, both Cone and Thompson were the least bit surprised that their 6-foot-8 enforcer got the top individual playoff honor. “I think it was fitting for Christian, because he represented, through the seven games, the hard work we had to do to stay with this team the whole way,” Cone said. “I think it’s really neat and cool that everybody recognized Christian, because usually, you’re not going to recognize that guy who does all the hard work, does the defense. He defended [Andrew] Nicholson early, set all the screens, running all over the place. He just comes out and plays with such great fire every time.” The Fil-German bruiser averaged 10.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.7 assists for the series overall, capped by a 12-point, 10-rebound, 6-assist line in the winner-take-all Game 7 – with countless more intangible moments that certainly helped sway the series in Ginebra’s favor. “Deserved. Very much deserved. We know Stan’s role here, guarding Nicholson from the start, and providing back side help defense with Japeth [Aguilar] for us who were defending [Myles] Powell,” Thompson said in Filipino. “Without them, we have no protectors. The only thing others see are us on defense, but they also cover a lot for us.” Since getting drafted in 2017, Standhardinger has been a constant, low-key presence wherever he suits up, helping to propel teams forward. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/business/international-monetary-fund-geo-economic-fragmentation-future-multilateralism-january-2023/,[],"WASHINGTON, USA – A severe fragmentation of the global economy after decades of increasing economic integration could reduce global economic output by up to 7%, but the losses could reach 8% to 12% in some countries, if technology is also decoupled, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new staff report. Tne IMF said even limited fragmentation could shave 0.2% off of global gross domestic product (GDP), but said more work was needed to assess the estimated costs to the international monetary system and the global financial safety net (GFSN). The note, released late Sunday, January 15, noted that the global flows of goods and capital had leveled off after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and a surge in trade restrictions seen in subsequent years. “The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have further tested international relations and increased skepticism about the benefits of globalization,” the staff report said. It said deepening trade ties had resulted in a large reduction in global poverty for years, while benefitting low-income consumers in advanced economies through lower prices. The unraveling of trade links “would most adversely impact low-income countries and less well-off consumers in advanced economies,” it said. Restrictions on cross-border migration would deprive host economies of valuable skills while reducing remittances in migrant-sending economies. Reduced capital flows would reduce foreign direct investment, while a decline in international cooperation would pose risks to provision of vital global public goods. The IMF said existing studies suggested that the deeper the fragmentation, the deeper the costs, with technological decoupling significantly amplifying losses from trade restrictions. It noted that emerging market economies and low-income countries are likely to be most at risk as the global economy shifted to more “financial regionalization” and a fragmented global payment system. “With less international risk-sharing, [global economic fragmentation] could lead to higher macroeconomic volatility, more severe crises, and greater pressures on national buffers,” it said. It could also weaken the ability of the global community to support countries in crisis and complicate the resolution of future sovereign debt crises. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/business/russian-oil-shipped-asia-chinese-supertankers-vessel-shortage/,[],"At least four Chinese-owned supertankers are shipping Russian Urals crude to China, according to trading sources and tracking data, as Moscow seeks vessels for exports after a G7 oil price cap restricted the use of Western cargo services and insurance. China, the world’s top oil importer, has continued buying Russian oil despite Western sanctions, after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping launched what they called a no-limit partnership before the war in Ukraine. The sources said a fifth supertanker, or very large crude carrier (VLCC), was shipping crude to India, which like China has continued buying Russian oil sold at a discount as many Western buyers turn to other suppliers. All five shipments were scheduled between December 22 and January 23, according to the sources and Eikon ship tracking data. The G7 price cap introduced in December allows countries outside the European Union to import seaborne Russian oil but it prohibits shipping, insurance, and re-insurance companies from handling Russian crude cargoes unless sold for below the $60 cap. “With Urals prices well below the price cap, the business of buying and trading Urals is essentially legitimate,” said an executive with a Chinese firm involved in the shipments. As the United States and its allies tried to choke off Moscow’s energy revenues to limit its ability to fund the Ukraine war, Russia quickly diverted oil exports from Europe last year, mainly to Asia. The longer voyages, heavy discounts, and record-high freight rates ate into profits but the use of supertankers on the Asian routes may now cut shipping costs. The Russian energy and transport ministries declined to comment. China’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment, although Beijing has previously called the Western sanctions on Russia illegal. Indian Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at a press briefing on Thursday, January 12, that India would buy oil from wherever it could secure the cheapest price. Industry sources say Indian refiners are securing a discount of $15 to $20 per barrel on Russian oil on a delivered basis compared to Brent. Russia is sending Urals from its Western ports for transhipment to supertankers Lauren II, Monica S, Catalina 7, and Natalina 7, all Panama-flagged ships bound for China, while the Sao Paulo is already approaching India, according to three trading sources and Eikon data. Based on Eikon data and public maritime databases, Lauren II is managed by China’s Greetee Company Ltd and owned by China’s Maisie Ltd, Catalina 7 is owned by Hong Kong’s Canes Venatici Ltd and Natalina 7 by Hong Kong’s Astrid Menks Ltd with both managed by China’s Runne Company Ltd, while Monica S is owned by China’s Gabrielle Ltd and managed by Derecttor Company Ltd. The Sao Paulo is owned and managed by Cyprus-based Rotimo Holdings Ltd. Reuters was unable to immediately contact the owners and managers because of a lack of public information about them. The executive with the Chinese firm involved in the shipments estimated a total of 18 Chinese supertankers and another 16 Aframax-sized vessels could be used for shipping Russian crude in 2023, enough to transport 15 million metric tons a year or about 10% of total Urals exports. A VLCC can carry up to 2 million barrels, a Suezmax vessel up to 1 million barrels, and Aframax up to 0.6 million barrels. While most Russian crude is now heading to China, India, and Turkey in Russian or non-western ships, G7 sanctions have led to a shortage of smaller ice-class tankers – many belonging to Greek and Norwegian companies – needed by Russia to transport its crude from Baltic Sea ports in winter. Russia and China do not have a large fleet of ice-class vessels and using Chinese VLCCs frees them up to travel from Baltic ports to conduct ship-to-ship transfers to bigger tankers in international waters, according to traders. This practice showed up in Eikon tracking data, including in Mediterranean international waters, with the executive highlighting operations near Ceuta, a Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa, and Greece’s Kalamata, a city in the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece. “It’s extremely expensive and doesn’t make sense to use ice-class tankers for long distances,” one European market trader said, explaining why VLCCs were being used. Another trader said the Ukraine war and sanctions had pushed up demand for smaller tankers and driven down rates for large vessels, helping reduce some of the extra costs Russia faces. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-are-you-poor/,[],"The question is deeply personal. A thoughtful response would take into account what the individual needs and values. Money? Family? Love? Leisure? Social Weather Stations (SWS) surveys on self-rated poverty simplifies the issue. Respondents only need to mark their answer on a card with a horizontal line in the middle dividing the binary choice between “Poor” and “Not Poor,” without having to justify their decision. Those who place themselves on the line are counted in the survey as “Borderline Poor.” The Marcos Jr. administration inherited a largely impoverished population, with only 23% in the SWS April 2022 survey denying that they were poor, in whatever terms they defined poverty. Six months into the new government, the December 2022 survey the numbers pronouncing themselves Not Poor had dropped to 18%. The number of those declaring themselves to be Poor increased from 43% to 51%. While the Borderline Poor numbers dipped from 34% to 31%, their combined numbers rose between April and December from 77% to 82%. Although people’s perception of their poverty cannot be fully explained exclusively in economic terms, research on poverty rates cannot dispense and often begins with income calculations. The SWS self-rated poverty survey includes two follow-up questions: 1) the Poverty Threshold (PT) or the monthly amount necessary to cover household expenses for the family not to feel poor; and 2) the Poverty Gap (PG) between this amount and what the family can provide. The December 2022 survey reported a PT of P15,000 and a PG of P5,000. Other authoritative sources of data complicate the task of understanding the Philippine poverty picture.  If you make less than P10,000/mo., the Bangko Sentral’s Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) would locate you among the Low Income (LI) class that covers about 26% of the population. An income between P10,000 to P29,000 would include you among the 40% in the Middle-Income bracket. At P30,000 a month, you would join the 34% of Filipinos CES considered High Income (HI). After the pandemic and probably even earlier, someone supporting a family of five would probably consider an annual income of P360,000 low. By 2021, the NEDA poverty line (PL) of P12,030/mo. had already breached the CES LI boundary. Setting the CES High Income mark at only three times the amount earned by the Low-Income class minimized and masked the income inequality prevailing in the country. Not that these definitions deceived the people. In a 1999 SWS survey, 54% of respondents judged Philippine society as elitist. By 2019, the perception of inequality had risen to 73%. The percentage of those who saw a more egalitarian country had dropped from 32% to 16%. Dr. Jose Ramon Albert, formerly head of the country’s statistics authority, proposed in 2018 a more realistic cluster of income classes that the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) adopted. The official poverty line, then at P10,727/mo., attributed to 22% of the population, set the base (Poor) of his six-level classification. Multiples of the PL pegged the boundaries of the higher income levels: from 2xPL for the 26% at Lower Income; 4xPL for 27% at Lower Middle; 10xPL for 10% at Middle Middle; 15xPL for the 3.6% at Upper Middle; and from 20xPL for the 1% at Upper Income. All those earning at 20xPL and beyond comprised the .4% of the Rich perched at the top of the income totem pole. While efforts to raise government salaries continue, the current concern for inclusive growth must address the glaring gap in income levels that the pandemic aggravated. The Philippine Standardization Law now pays a base rate of P156,000 a year. COA reported that BSP Governor Ben Diokno more than doubled his income between 2020 and 2021 from P19.8 million to P41.8 million. Differences in scope of work and responsibility make disparity in earnings necessary and unavoidable. In the United States, the embrace of meritocracy and vigorous capitalist competition as articles of faith has justified tolerance of a higher level of income inequality. Bloomberg and IMF data in 2019 showed that American CEOs received compensation 265 times higher than the median pay of employees, compared to 201 times in the UK, 136 times in Germany, and 58 times in Japan. But even in the US, the widening disparity in income levels between the wealthy 1% and the rest of the population triggered the Occupy Wall St. Movement and the rise of a populist backlash against the elite. Between 2020-2022, American industries raised average corporate CEO salaries from 160 to 235 times over the pay that median-level workers received. More alarming, a Brookings survey last April showed that one-third of 22 companies employing more than 7 million frontline workers did not pay a living wage to more than half of their employees.  It is not simply differences in compensation levels that arouse anger. Resentment is higher among those who experience a decline in their living standards because their earnings fail to keep pace with rising costs — and this group is expanding to include more people from the middle- and upper-income classes. Dr. Albert’s more finely-tuned income classification may already need updating to distinguish income gradations among the roughly half-a-million people collectively recognized as belonging to the .4% Rich. It would be instructive to subject to closer scrutiny, as the US Occupy Wall Street Movement eventually did, on the composition, character and behavior of the .1% ultra-rich. In the US, the focus tends to center on the wealth accumulated by executives in the private business sectors; hence, Wall St. as the target. In our case, the balance of political power has already shifted from the private corporate sector to government officials. It would not be surprising to see economic power and wealth flowing in the same direction. Especially when members of political dynasties also begin to acquire business interests. – Rappler.com Edilberto de Jesus is a senior research fellow at the Ateneo School of Government."

No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. NUSTAR Resort and Casino’s “Island of New Celebrations” is launching the country’s first “jumbotron” – currently the biggest 3D LED billboard and the only one in the Visayas and Mindanao. Measuring 620 square meters, NUSTAR’s 3D LED billboard is expected to be captivating, iconic, entertaining, and adventurous. To effectively deliver on its promise of being the ultimate leisure and entertainment destination in the region, NUSTAR is taking on another feat with the launching of its 3D LED billboard just in time for the grand return of the Sinulog. “This display gives viewers a more creative and immersive experience, for more engaging and effective storytelling,” says Katrina Mae de Jesus, director for business development and brand marketing of Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc. She adds that for Sinulog day, January 15, NUSTAR’s billboard also played a role in the kick-off of the grand parade at the South Road Properties. “It will be our pleasure to be part of this very grand Sinulog Festival, which has been sorely missed not only by local tourists but at the same time our guests from all over the world. It’s time to celebrate and have fun.” As the “Island of New Celebrations” and the new star of the Sinulog festivities, NUSTAR Resort and Casino is adding another feather to its cap with the launch of its 3D LED billboard. With this technology being as iconic as the brand and the Sinulog festival itself, NUSTAR is all set to celebrate the grandest and most captivating festival in the Philippines. After a three-year hiatus, the Sinulog marked its return this year with a full-scale celebration that is still anchored in faith and gratitude. With the events and activities leading up to Sinulog Sunday on January 15, 2023, Cebu’s rich and vibrant culture and heritage took center stage, and NUSTAR is proud to be one with the island province in commemorating this fete. Combining billboard advertising and 3D technology on massive LED screens, 3D billboards require precise calculations and creativity. They can produce a three-dimensional visual of just about anything, from a movie trailer to a sneaker ad. This technology works on the principle of “forced perspective,” which is a technique that uses an object’s scale and the audience’s vantage point to make something appear larger, smaller, nearer, or far from the spectator. Through 3D technology, two images taken from different angles are combined and put into a single clip. That is how the viewers’ left and right eyes see the subject from different points, and the brain recognizes the visuals in three-dimensional depth. In order to achieve this illusion, curved displays with two faces are usually employed. NUSTAR’s promotional campaigns, both static and digital, are regularly flashed on the 3D LED billboard to include hotel and food and beverage promotions to casino jackpots, tournaments, and raffle draws. NUSTAR Resort and Casino is the flagship project of Universal Hotels and Resorts, Inc.

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/world-economic-forum-ferdinand-marcos-jr-things-to-know-davos-switzerland/,['JODESZ GAVILAN'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. continues to live up to his jet-setting reputation as he ventured into his second foreign trip this year, or his eighth in total, since he was sworn into office in June 2022. Fresh from his state visit to China, Marcos and his entourage are now in Davos, Switzerland for a five-day trip to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF), where the President eyes doing a “soft launch” of the proposed sovereign wealth fund, or the controversial Maharlika Investment Fund, among others. But Marcos, the only Southeast Asian leader in attendance, has nothing to show to the WEF, according to Rappler columnist and economist JC Punongbayan. Critics are calling out the administration for prioritizing spending millions of taxpayers’ money to attend the event while Filipinos continue to suffer from rising prices of basic commodities, among others. Davos is not a cheap place to visit as a solo traveler, let alone with an entire entourage. But what do we need to know about Davos, the venue of choice for WEF? Davos is located in the western part of Switzerland, near its border with Liechtenstein, and is under the jurisdiction of the Canton of Graubünden. It’s considered one of the highest places in the European continent, sitting at least 1,560 meters above sea level. Davos is a small mountain town with a land area of 284 square kilometers, almost twice the size of Quezon City. As of December 2021, Davos had a population of at least 12,148 – a small percentage of the total Swiss population of 8.7 million. As of 2020, at least 8,390 were employed, with more than half working in small businesses spread across Davos. There is no available data on how many Filipinos are in Davos itself, but there are at least 12,200 Filipinos in Switzerland, according to latest data available. The small town has gained prominence for being the venue of international conferences, particularly the World Economic Forum. In 1971, the Alpine town first hosted the European Management Symposium, the beginning of what would be 50 years of meetings of government, business, and civil society actors to tackle world issues. Davos may now be synonymous with the WEF, but it has also become a popular travel destination in Europe. The Alpine town considers itself at the “forefront of development of modern winter sports,” placing Davos on the map when it comes to these types of field events, including skiing and sledding. This is not hard to imagine, especially with the physical characteristics of Davos. It may be a small area with an even smaller population, but its snow-capped mountains are a perfect setting for relaxation and sports. At least 84,138 tourists visited Davos during the summer months of June to August in 2022. Davos is clearly marketed for tourists and travelers. It has a number of hotels, holiday apartments, and mountain huts that can accommodate those who want to visit the snowy mountains. But visiting it, and spending even just one night, could mean an empty pocket, especially if there’s no business or taxpayers’ money to dig into. For instance, a quick look at travel accommodations website Booking.com shows that a hotel double room from the center for one night during WEF now costs almost P300,000. The search also yields results of hotels kilometers outside Davos already, given that most are already fully booked by now. These options range from P11,000 to P150,000 a night, depending on location and quality of accommodations. On “normal” days outside of the WEF week, a simple hotel room can go for as low as P7,800 a night. Five-star hotels, meanwhile, can be booked for P25,000 to P50,000 a night. Before it was associated with WEF and winter sports, Davos was also identified as a “summer mountain health resort,” according to its website. Guests from all over Europe have visited the town to cure themselves of sickness because the climate and environment of Davos is conducive to such. Alexander Spengler, a German physician, even established a spa in Davos where tuberculosis patients can recuperate. Novelist Thomas Mann even set his 1924 work, The Magic Mountain in Davos, partly influenced by his wife’s stay in the town. Since then, the small alpine town has branded itself as a science city. Davos is now home to numerous research institutions that seek to uncover new approaches to specific issues and introduce innovations as needed. These institutions include the Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, and the World Radiation Center, among others. Will the Marcos administration get anything worthwhile that would benefit the Philippines from his five-day stay in this expensive Alpine town? – Rappler.com"

In a decision promulgated on Monday, January 16, the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 42 also acquitted her son Marco Martin Cam and former Batuan vice mayor Nelson Cambaya. All three can now walk free from detention. “In light of the fact that there are pieces of evidence that foster doubt on the guilt of the accused, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused,” the ruling read. Yuson was shot dead by unidentified men in October 2019, while having breakfast outside a house in Sampaloc, Manila. Yuson’s wife Lalaine had alleged that the Cams were involved in the killing of her husband, because their son, Charmax Jan Yuson, defeated Marco Martin in the May 2019 mayoral election in Batuan. The Cams have vehemently denied the allegations. On Monday, Cam’s legal counsel said they were glad that “justice has prevailed.” “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Thank you Lord! All praises unto you,” the older Cam said. Yuson’s son Charmax, who won his reelection bid in 2022, said they will file an appeal with the court. “Dismayado po kasi buhay ng tatay ko ang nakasalalay dito (We are dismayed because it’s the life of our dad we are fighting for),” he said. Aside from the two Cams and Cambaya, the Department of Justice in 2021 also indicted four individuals for murder and frustrated murder in connection with the case, namely: Junel Gomez, Bradford Solis, Juanito de Luna, and Rigor dela Cruz. The trial court did not acquit the said four individuals, and only “sent to the archives” the cases against them, as they “remain at large” despite their standing arrest warrants. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/lawsuits-artificial-intelligence-artists-class-action-stability-midjourney-deviantart/,['GELO GONZALES'],"MANILA, Philippines – A group of artists have filed a lawsuit against image-generating AI applications Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt with its DreamUp product, its representative Joseph Saveri Law Firm announced in a press release on Saturday, January 14, US time. The firm states that the companies have “created products that infringe the rights of artists and other creative individuals under the guise of alleged ‘artificial intelligence.’” The products in question make use of Stable Diffusion, an open-source technology able to generate images from a text prompt, “trained” using the LAION-5B dataset which contains 5.85 billion images paired with a text description. The lawsuit’s point of contention is that the images contained within this dataset are “copyrighted images” that were “downloaded and used without compensation or consent from the artists.” Co-counsel Matthew Butterick calls the technology in his blog, “a 21st-cen­tury col­lage tool that remixes the copy­righted works of mil­lions of artists whose work was used as train­ing data.” The companies’ specific violations, according to the lawsuit, are direct copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement related to forgeries, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), violation of class members’ rights of publicity, breach of contract related to the DeviantArt Terms of Service, and various violations of California’s unfair competition laws. The plaintiffs are artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McK­er­nan, and Karla Ortiz. The law firm said, “If Stable Diffusion and similar products are allowed to continue to operate as they do now, the foreseeable result is they will replace the very artists whose stolen works power these AI products with whom they are competing. AI image products are not just an infringement of artists’ rights; whether they aim to or not, these products will eliminate ‘artist’ as a viable career path.” The lawsuit aims to ensure that the new products “follow the same rules as any other new technology that involves the use of massive amounts of intellectual property.” “If streaming music can be accomplished within the law, so can AI products,” the firm said. Since the sudden popularity of generative AI technologies in 2022 including Stable Diffusion and the GPT-3 large language model used by ChatGPT, artists and creative workers have protested against its current use, raising concerns on ethics, and the legality of the training data used. ChatGPT has been used by some students to cheat on their homework while the same law firm taking action against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, filed in November 2022 a lawsuit against a similar AI-enabled tool for generating computer code by Microsoft called CoPilot. – Rappler.com"

Marcos. The video with the claim also says that the politicians impeached Estrada using a blank envelope. Why we fact-checked this: The YouTube video containing the claim has over 15,523 views as of writing. Grounds for Estrada’s impeachment: A Philippine Daily Inquirer report said that Estrada was impeached with bribery, graft and corruption, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the Constitution as grounds. Estrada’s alleged plan to fulfill Marcos’ last will wasn’t one of them. Envelope contained evidence: The envelope referred to by the video with the claim supposedly contains strong evidence that links Estrada to bank deposits worth over a billion pesos under the name of “Jose Velarde.” On whether or not to open the envelope, 10 senator-judges presiding over Estrada’s impeachment trial voted “yes” while 11 voted no. This led then-Senate president Aquilino “Nene” Pimentel Jr. to resign as Senate president and walk out of the hall along with nine other senators. The Senate walkout sparked the EDSA People Power II from January 16 to 20, 2001, resulting in then-vice president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo becoming the 14th president of the Philippines. The Sandiganbayan sentenced Estrada to reclusion perpetua in September 2007 but Arroyo granted him pardon a month later. – Lorenz Pasion/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-explains-shakeup-security-sector-afp-nsa-january-2023/,['SOFIA TOMACRUZ'],"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. reappointed General Andres Centino as military chief to fix a “seniority” problem in which a three-star general, instead of the traditional four-star, had led the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). The President also changed his national security adviser (NSA) after Clarita Carlos, the retired political science professor who first occupied this post under Marcos, found the job “political.” Marcos explained the security sector shake-up in an interview with reporters on Monday, January 16, on his way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. This was days after he announced a new AFP chief of staff, defense secretary, and national security adviser – and only seven months after he took office. “Kasi nira-rationalize namin ‘yung seniority (Because we are rationalizing the seniority),” said Marcos, when asked why he decided to replace former AFP chief of staff Lieutenant General Bartolome Vicente Bacarro and reappoint General Centino. Bacarro carried three stars as military chief while Centino, whom he replaced in August 2022, was the lone four-star general in the AFP. Centino served as AFP chief of staff from November 2021, under then-president Rodrigo Duterte, until Marcos initially replaced him with Bacarro in August 2022. By law, there can only be one four-star general in the armed forces – the AFP chief. Although Centino no longer held the top post at the start of the Marcos administration, he did not retire early and therefore still kept the four stars on his shoulders. This meant that Bacarro, throughout his brief stint as AFP chief, remained a lieutenant general with three stars. “So kailangan natin ayusin kasi magkakagulo doon sa baba,” Marcos said. “There were some comments that were made: ‘Paano ‘yan ‘pag nag-extend-extend, kami naman dito sa lower ranks, wala na kaming pag-asa?’” (So we needed to fix that because there would be trouble in the lower ranks. There were some comments made: “If they extend and extend, how about us here in the lower ranks, will we no longer have hope?”) Marcos described the situation as “not right,” saying it would cause low morale in the uniformed service. To address this, Marcos said his administration then asked the military what was needed, “and I said ayusin namin ‘yung (we will fix the) seniority, and that’s what we’ve done.” Before Centino’s reappointment, Bacarro had been expected to hold the post as the AFP’s first three-year chief of staff until 2025. Bacarro had been given the post just a month before his scheduled retirement in September 2022, but was extended under Republic Act No. 11709, which implemented fixed terms of key officers of the military, “unless sooner terminated by the President.” Like Bacarro, Centino reassumes the top military post just a month before his retirement in February. It was not immediately clear if Centino will continue to serve beyond his schedule retirement. Asked in an earlier press briefing if he would serve for three years, Centino told defense reporters, “It’s really up to the President.” It was this change in AFP leadership that prompted former defense officer-in-charge Jose Faustino Jr. to resign on January 6. Faustino earlier disclosed that he had been kept out of the loop on Bacarro’s exit, learning only through the media that Centino had taken his oath with Marcos. Malacañang later refuted Faustino’s claim, saying the former acting defense chief “knew of” developments related to Centino’s reappointment. Marcos later named retired general Carlito Galvez Jr. as Faustino’s replacement. Asked why he appointed Galvez, the President cited Galvez’ experience. “In fact as soon as he took his oath… he knew already what to do. He presided over the command conference. So I think he’ll slide into that position really easily,” Marcos said in a mix of English and Filipino. Also asked about the change in his NSA, Marcos said Carlos “found that position to be a little bit political.” “Hindi talaga siya sanay sa gano’n (She’s not really used to that),” said Marcos, “and she is an academic, a retired academic.” Carlos, who taught political science at the University of the Philippines, was the country’s first female NSA at least since the presidency of Marcos’ father. Before Carlos, the post typically went to former military officers or politicians with defense background. The NSA advises the president on all issues related to security – from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency to maritime security, especially now that Philippines is still staking its claim against China in the West Philippine Sea. Carlos, stepping down from the role, said she decided to instead join the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department of the House of Representatives. “I have realized that it is no longer politic to continue as NSA to the President and so, I have decided to migrate to another agency where my expertise on foreign, defense and security policy will be of use and I shall continue to help build a Better Philippines,” Carlos said. Carlos was replaced by former interior secretary and military chief Eduardo Año. Marcos said he decided to choose the retired general because of his “long, long, long experience in intelligence.” “He’s well-known and he knows all of the operatives in the intelligence community,” Marcos said. – Rappler.com"

The data on the recorders may help investigators determine what caused the ATR 72 aircraft, carrying 72 people, to crash in clear weather just before landing in the tourist city of Pokhara. Teknath Sitaula, a Kathmandu Airport official, said the so-called black boxes “are in a good condition now. They look good from outside.” Rescuers were battling cloudy weather and poor visibility as they scoured the river gorge for passengers who are unaccounted for, more than 24 hours after the crash. Sixty-eight bodies have been recovered. The plane, on a scheduled flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara, gateway to the scenic Annapurna mountain range, was carrying 57 Nepalis, five Indians, four Russians, two South Koreans, and one person each from Argentina, Ireland, Australia and France. Pokhara police official Ajay K.C. said the search-and-rescue operation, which stopped because of darkness on Sunday, had resumed. “We will take out the five bodies from the gorge and search for the remaining four that are still missing,” he told Reuters. “It is cloudy now… causing a problem in the search.” The other 63 bodies had been sent to a hospital, he said. A spokesperson for Pokhara airport also said that the weather was hampering rescue efforts, but that clouds were expected to clear later in the day. Nearly 350 people have died since 2000 in plane or helicopter crashes in Nepal – home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest – where sudden weather changes can make for hazardous conditions. Experts say air accidents are usually caused by a combination of factors, and investigations can take months or longer. India’s aviation regulator said it would take all measures to ensure safe aviation in the country’s airspace. Nepal has declared a day of national mourning on Monday and set up a panel to investigate the disaster and suggest measures to avoid such incidents in future. – Rappler.com"

https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/former-biff-fighter-uses-music-barmm-peace-building/,[],"COTABATO, Philippines – A former radical combatant has found a new way to express his beliefs and contribute to his community and region through music. The 35-year-old Ahmed, as he prefers to be called, used to be a member of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), an organization that allied with the international terror group Islamic State and sought an independent state in Mindanao. Ahmed’s father was a top commander in the group, which was led by the late Ustadz Ameril Umbra Kato, the former head of the 105th Base Command of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). In 2010, Ahmed’s father joined Umbra Kato in leaving the MILF and forming the BIFF. Ahmed, who was a teenager at the time, said he decided to join his father in order to defend the cause of the organization and to aid his father. However, Ahmed has since changed his mind about the group’s mission and has decided to put down his guns and embrace peace. Ahmed, now Cotabato-based, comes from a family of musicians from the old Maguindanao province and loves playing traditional musical instruments such as kulintang, agong, gandingan, babendil, and dabakan, among others. However, during his time as a combatant, he was unable to play music as the sound of gunfire and explosions became the new soundtrack of his life. Ahmed said he and his group would move from one community to another to evade government troops, which was “extremely difficult” for him and his family. “We went from one place to another, and we didn’t know if we would still wake up because bombs might fall on us anytime while we were asleep. It was difficult to sleep, especially during times when the military was on the offensive. At times, we were also forced to drink dirty water,” he recalled. What ultimately changed Ahmed’s mind was his family. He married young and had five children. He and his wife had to constantly move around as they were being chased by government troops, which made it hard for his wife to give birth to their children in one place. Ahmed said he realized that his family’s safety and well-being were more important to him than anything else. As time passed, Ahmed said he and his father realized that they had no clear direction and that their former comrades in the MILF were now running the Bangsamoro government. At first, they were hesitant, but they later realized that the government was sincere in its efforts to improve people’s welfare and bring peace to the region. Ahmed said he and his father were touched when Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao officials and former MILF comrades reached out to them, saying that they were welcome to be part of inclusive governance.

https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/justin-brownlee-ecstatic-celebrate-first-all-filipino-title-barangay-ginebra/,[],"MANILA, Philippines – Barangay Ginebra just won the PBA Commissioner’s Cup title on Sunday, January 15, as a league all-time record 54,589 people watched the Gin Kings conquer the visiting Bay Area Dragons in Game 7 at the jam-packed Philippine Arena. At the center of it all is Ginebra’s resident import Justin Brownlee, who is still perfect in the finals after winning his sixth championship in just as many tries. Winning may be getting a little old hat for the 34-year-old superstar, but this particular title tugs a little bit harder on Brownlee’s heartstrings, as he celebrated it only as an import on paper. “We played with all Filipinos tonight, for the first time since I’ve been here. So, that was very special. The teammates, all my teammates definitely congratulated me and they were telling me how proud they are for me becoming a Filipino. It was very special,” he said after the 114-99 title-clinching blowout. After being introduced as “our new kababayan” (countryman) in the league’s elaborate pre-game introduction ceremony, Brownlee proceeded to overwhelm Bay Area with an early scoring barrage, and at one point was responsible for 23 of Ginebra’s first 50 points. Overall, the 6-foot-5 all-around star finished with 34 points on a stellar 14-of-22 clip, 4-of-7 from three, a game-high 12 assists, 8 rebounds, and 3 blocks, as the rest of his fellow Filipino standouts took over in the second half. “And just to top it off with a win, you know, this win is not only for Ginebra, this is for the whole country,” Brownlee continued. “We played an international team, and we got to give a lot of credit to Bay Area. They came out and played tough. They were coached very well and I’m just happy that we got away with a win tonight.” Just three days before the do-or-die Game 7 with the Dragons, President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. signed Brownlee’s naturalization papers to formally become a Filipino citizen – ending a four-year process for the longtime Gin King reinforcement. As the process sped up in the latter half of 2022, Brownlee juggled games, Senate hearings, and practices for both Ginebra and the Gilas Pilipinas national team, where he will most likely suit up for soon as the 2023 FIBA World Cup approaches. Brownlee has another long journey ahead of him donning blue colors after eight years of wearing red, but that is another chapter for another day. For now, the Ginebra legend of “Justin Noypi” continues to grow. – Rappler.com"

Welcome back sa iyong tahanan Kuys Vhong,” the variety show’s official account posted on Monday, alongside photos of Vhong with other It’s Showtime hosts. (It’s a different kind of joy when you have friends and family that are waiting for you. Welcome back to your home, Vhong.) Comedian Vice Ganda led the cheers for Vhong’s return, saying: “I’m sure katulad naming mga kaibigan niya at kapatid, miss na miss niyo na siya. Kaya sama-sama tayong lahat na nagmamahal sa kanya…. Eto na siya, muli na natin siyang makakapiling,” he said. (I’m sure that just like us, his friends, you guys also miss him a lot. That’s why, for everyone who loves him, let’s be together in welcoming him back.… We’ll finally be with him again.) A tearful Vhong is then seen onstage, before being enveloped by a group hug by his fellow hosts. “Welcome back! We love you, Vhong,” they said. Vice first hinted about Vhong’s return on the show’s Friday, January 13 episode, saying that the unnamed celebrity had gone through hardships in 2022. “Sabi ko sa kanya…sa sobrang bigat nang pinagdaanan mo last year, ang pinakamaganda namang kasama niyan ay sinamahan ka, kinampihan ka, at pinaniwalaan ka ng madlang people,” Vice said, relaying a recent conversation with that said celebrity. (I told him…he has gone through so much difficulty last year, but what matters most is that the people still supported you and believed in you.) Vhong has been absent from the show since September 2022 when a Taguig court ordered his arrest for an acts of lasciviousness case filed by model Deniece Cornejo in 2014. He was transferred to the Taguig City Jail from the National Bureau of Investigation facility in November. In December, he was allowed to post bail as a judge ruled that the evidence presented by the prosecution in the bail hearings was too weak to warrant Navarro’s continued detention pending the trial of his case. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-sph-media-circulation-numbers-inflated-internal-review/,['VICTOR BARREIRO JR.'],"MANILA, Philippines – The Straits Times said an internal review of the circulation numbers of its parent company SPH Media showed they were inflated or overstated, in a scandal that could break the trust of news readers – and advertisers – in the company. The Straits Times reported on January 9 that the company began an internal review of its processes in March 2022. In it, SPH Media found a discrepancy of between 85,000 and 95,000 daily average copies across all titles, which represents 10% to 12% of SPH Media’s reported daily average circulation – from September 2020 to March 2022. SPH Media publishes The Straits Times and The Business Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Shin Min Daily News, Berita Harian, and Tamil Murasu. Wake Up Singapore, an alternative media outfit in the country, added at least three executives were made to leave SPH Media over the created discrepancies. In a Channel News Asia report, SPH Media’s spokesperson added, “The staff involved had been taken to task, or had left the organization,” without naming anyone involved. SPH Media’s spokesperson cited some of its missteps. These included counting lapsed contracts in its circulation data, counting papers into the circulation numbers which were printed then destroyed, and also double-counting subscriptions across multiple instances. Said the spokesperson, “A project account was injected with additional funding over a period of time to purchase fictitious circulation.” “Certain circulation numbers were arbitrarily derived,” the spokesperson added. The scandal, and how it is being covered, points to a likely erosion of trust in the media group. Trust in news all over the world is already declining. Obvious details, such as naming those responsible and denoting what actions were taken against the offending parties, should have been part of transparent coverage in the company’s issues but remain undisclosed. Semafor’s Gina Chua, in an analysis of the issue, noted that “If, despite having a near-monopoly, you still have to inflate circulation by 10% or more, that suggests a deep disconnect with Singaporean readers.” The fudging of the numbers translates into uncertainty, which can also taint advertiser sentiment and increase hesitance in supporting SPH Media, creating a cycle of distrust that may be difficult to bounce back from. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/only-in-hollywood-hello-dolly-de-leon-goodbye-lisa-marie-presley/,['RUBEN V. NEPALES'],"LOS ANGELES, USA – I was returning to my table in the International Ballroom of The Beverly Hilton when Lisa Marie Presley and Priscilla Presley arrived from the red carpet media line of the Golden Globe Awards last January 10. Even in a ballroom packed with A-listers, the two Presley women stopped traffic as they paused at the top of the stairs leading to what they call the pit, the level nearest the stage and where the two ladies sat in a table with Elvis star Austin Butler and director Baz Luhrmann. When Austin won best actor – motion picture – drama for playing the rock and roll legend who died at 42, he thanked the two Presleys, who were misty-eyed. Lisa Marie put both of her hands on her face as Austin, eerily still speaking in the voice and accent of the King, said, “I also want to thank our incredible producers and Warner Brothers and the Presley family. Thank you, guys. Thank you for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me.” “Lisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever. You could at least play ‘Suspicious Minds’ or something…. And lastly, Elvis Presley himself. You were an icon and a rebel, and I love you so much. Thank you. You are all remembered, and I will never forget.” Backstage with the press, Austin, asked what advice he got from the Presleys when he was preparing for the role, answered, “It was less advice and more a feeling of blessing, which meant so much to me.” Imagine my shock when I read online that the only daughter of Elvis and Priscilla died of cardiac arrest just two days after attending the Globes. Lisa Marie, who had her own career as a singer-songwriter, was only 54. News stories reported that Lisa Marie appeared frail when she was being interviewed by Extra host Billy Bush on the carpet and that at one point, she told Jerry Schilling, her friend and manager, “I’m going to grab your arm.” Riley Keough, Lisa Marie’s daughter with ex-husband Danny Keough, and the eldest grandchild of Elvis and Priscilla, is a 2017 Golden Globe best actress – limited series, anthology series, or television motion picture nominee for The Girlfriend Experience. Riley’s feature directing debut with Gina Gammell, War Pony, won the 2022 Cannes Film Festival Golden Camera prize. The New York Times wrote that just four days before she passed away, Lisa Marie went to Graceland, Elvis’ famed mansion which she inherited, to commemorate what would have been her dad’s 88th birthday. A representative said that Lisa Marie will be buried alongside her son, Benjamin, who died in 2020, on the grounds of Graceland, where Elvis and other family members are also buried. Lisa Marie’s passing is a sad coda to my notes on the 80th Golden Globes, which marked the return, after two years, of the in-person ceremonies of the awards presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association or HFPA to honor excellence in film and television. The following are my rambling notes of the sidelights and highlights from the red carpet, during the show inside the ballroom and the after-party. Despite predictions of rain, which was pelting California for a few days, the skies cleared last January 10, as if on a film director’s cue, just as the red carpet – well, actually gray in keeping with the pastel motif that the show’s producers picked – was about to open. Dolly de Leon made her entrance on the carpet as the first Filipino best supporting actress nominee (for Triangle of Sadness) in the Globes’ 80-year history, not from a limo but at the end of the carpet line since she was staying at the Hilton. So she entered the gray carpet from the other side, the lobby. After interviews with Janet Nepales (GMA 7) and Yong Chavez (ABS-CBN) and posing for photos with Filipino guests, designer David Tupaz, Geoffrey Jimenez, Desiree Baker, and Benjamin Manansala Cabrera, the actress made her way to the front of the carpet line. Despite the carpet media line frenzy, Dolly and many of her fellow nominees, stars, and talents somehow got to pose for Hunter Abrams in stunning portraits taken in a room with orange-peach plush drapes and walls. Dolly was in good company. Among those who had portraits taken were Eddie Redmayne and wife Hannah Bagshawe, Anya Taylor-Joy, Viola Davis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Quinta Brunson, Michelle Yeoh, Matt Bomer, Michelle Williams, Jenna Ortega, and MJ Rodriguez, and filmmakers Tim Burton, Ryan Coogler, and James Cameron. Walking the carpet again brought back the reporters’ occupational hazard – stepping onto the long trains of the talents. This year, among the stars whose voluminous skirts made me extra careful lest I step on their trains included Billy Porter, Lily James, and Jenna Ortega. James Cameron and Steven Spielberg, chatting and posing for photos, were among the talents who walked the long tented carpet line. In previous years, I rushed from the red carpet a few minutes before the show began, so by the time I got to sit down at my table, all the dinner plates had been cleared away to make the ballroom ready for the telecast on NBC (Peacock also streamed the Globes this year). In some years, if I was lucky, the dessert plate was still there. But usually, chocolates are all that’s left on the table so I wolfed those down hurriedly before the show began. This year, I somehow finally had the luxury of sitting down to enjoy the full menu prepared by Matthew Morgan, The Bev Hilton’s executive chef. In a first, I got to savor the first course, a grapefruit salad, followed by Icelandic salmon (the vegan alternative was butternut squash) and a limoncello dome for dessert. On the table were magnum bottles of Moet & Chandon 2012 Grand Vintage and Moet Rosé, plus bottles of red and white wine. Stars usually arrive just in time for the show, so oftentimes, it’s just chocolates and champagne for them. I know that we became aware of the guest stars getting hungry, since their dinner plates had been cleared away, so sandwiches or sushi platters were put on tables. The show, hosted by Jerrod Carmichael, started on a moving, emotional note when presenter Jennifer Hudson called Ke Huy Quan as the first winner – best supporting actor – motion picture for Everything Everywhere All at Once. The first-time Globe winner got many in the ballroom and folks watching at home misty-eyed as he choked up delivering his acceptance speech. Looking also moved was Steven Spielberg who gave Ke, then 12, his big break as a child actor with the Harrison Ford sidekick role, Short Round, in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. “I was raised to never forget where I came from, and to always remember who gave me my first opportunity. I am so happy to see Steven Spielberg here tonight,” Ke said. “When I started my career as a child actor in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, I felt so very lucky to have been chosen.” “As I grew older, I started to wonder if that was it, if that was just luck. For so many years, I was afraid I had nothing more to offer. No matter what I did, I would never surpass what I achieved as a kid. Thankfully, more than 30 years later, two guys thought of me. They remembered that kid, and they gave me an opportunity to try again.” “Everything that has happened since has been unbelievable. [Everything Everywhere… directors] Dan Kwan, Daniel Scheinert, thank you so, so much for helping me find my answer. You have given me more than I could have ever hoped.” According to reader Victor Bowman, Ke is the first Vietnam native to win in the category. Dolly lost to Angela Bassett (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), but to hear the Filipina actress’ name mentioned in the same breath as Jamie Lee Curtis, Carey Mulligan, Angela, and Kerry Condon was a thrill by itself. Michelle Yeoh, who became the first Malaysian to win a Globe award – best actress – motion picture – musical/comedy for Everything Everywhere… was just as stirring in her speech. She said, “Forty years – I’m not letting go of this. It’s been an amazing journey and an incredible fight to be here today but I think it’s been worth it. I remember when I first came to Hollywood, it was a dream come true…until I got here because look at this face! I came here and was told, ‘You’re a minority,’ and I was like, ‘No that’s not possible.’” “Then someone said to me, ‘You speak English?’ I told them, ‘The flight here was about 13 hours long, so I learned.’” “As time went by – I turned 60 last year, and I think all of you women understand this. As the days, the years, and the numbers get bigger, it seems like opportunities start to get smaller as well.” “Then came the best gift: Everything Everywhere All at Once.” But as piano music started being played to remind her to wrap up her speech, she quipped, ‘Shut up, I can beat you up! And I’m serious.’” “This woman resonated so deeply with me and with so many people because whatever universe she was in, she was fighting for the love of her family…. This is for all the shoulders that I stand on and all the people coming with me on this journey going forward.” NBC News cited Michele’s “shut up” quip as having a “deeper meaning” for “Asian women, who contend with historical pressures from within the community and beyond to make themselves small.” The news story quoted Catherine Ceniza Choy, author of Asian American Histories of the United States, as saying, “We saw Michelle Yeoh take up space and insist on using her voice. We have to live with these stereotypes and expectations of being demure and diminutive on the daily. So to witness that on such a big stage of something like the Golden Globes was profound.” With M.M. Keeravani and Chandrabose winning the best song award for “Naatu Naatu” from RRR, beating heavyweights Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and Alexandre Desplat, it was a big night for Asian representation. Steven Spielberg, who won his third Globe best director – motion picture trophy for The Fabelmans, which also won best motion picture – drama, was touching as well in his remarks. He said about The Fabelmans, which was inspired by his growing up years as a budding filmmaker, “I put a lot of things in my way of this story. I told this story in parts and parcels all through my career. And my wife Kate [Capshaw] was always saying, ‘You have to tell this.’ During COVID, I didn’t know if any of us were going to have the chance to tell any of our stories again.” “Everything I’ve done up to this point has made me ready to finally be honest about the fact that it’s not easy to be a kid. Everybody sees me as a success story…. But nobody really knows who we are until we’re courageous enough to tell everyone.” “I spent a lot of time trying to figure out when I could tell that story, and I figured out when I turned 74 years old. I said, ‘You better do it now.’ And I’m really, really happy I did.” I have never tired of watching the interactions during the commercial breaks when the stars and power brokers rise from their chairs and schmooze. When the show resumes, the talents quickly take their seats, and the room is back to normal, like magic. Cited as the most affecting encounter during a commercial break was when Ke and Steven Spielberg, who ended up being both winners, embraced tightly. The veteran filmmaker reportedly told Ke, “I’m so proud of you!” Although Brad Pitt, nominated for Damien Chazelle’s Babylon, lost to Ke, he was the man du jour on the pit. Just the sight of the handsome actor, who was seated beside his Babylon costar and fellow nominee Margot Robbie, stopped the winners and presenters midway into their acceptance speeches: Quinta Brunson: “Comedy is so important to me. Comedy brings people together. Comedy gives us all the same laugh…. Hey, Brad Pitt.” “He’s right there!” she told her Abbott Elementary team on stage. Regina Hall: “Hi everyone. Sorry about this. Um, I think they got my name wrong. Yeah, it’s Mrs. Pitt. Brad is right here, so I’m so sorry, honey.” Austin Butler to his Once Upon a Time in Hollywood costar: “Brad, I love you.” Harvey Guillen, the voice of Perrito in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, paused in his presenter spiel to wave at Brad. The dashing object of all this unexpected attention from the stage simply laughed each time. Easily one of the most uproarious quips onstage was by Cecil B. DeMille awardee Eddie Murphy, who shared his blueprint for success: “It’s very simple, just do these three things: pay your taxes, mind your business – and keep Will Smith‘s wife’s name out your f***ing mouth!” That had the whole ballroom erupting in laughter as Eddie left the stage. Backstage in the photographers’ room, one of their favorite moments was when Paul Walter Hauser lay down, like a Botero reclining figure, on the platform with his best supporting actor – television limited series/motion picture trophy (for Black Bird). Earlier, on the carpet, he surprised folks on the bleachers when he suddenly appeared with them. When the show ended, guests trekked one floor down to the poolside for the after-party presented with Billboard. As in previous years, a temporary floor covered the pool to create the perfect outdoors bash setting. If Brad was the prom king inside the ballroom, Jennifer Coolidge was the prom queen at the after-party. Holding her best supporting actress – television limited series/motion picture (for The White Lotus) trophy above her head, she was surrounded by many guests who wanted to congratulate her. Just how fun and joyous was the affair? As Janet and I were talking to HFPA’s interim CEO, Todd Boehly, a friend took our photo. We were not aware that there were two photobombing dudes beside us. When we looked at the snapshots the following day, the photobombers turned out to be Top Gun: Maverick actors Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. No doubt the after-party’s great mood was because Billboard knows its music. Deejays, singers, and even a man playing the saxophone as he walked around got the guests in a dancing mood. Also a draw for the newly minted Globe winners like Ke, The White Lotus’ Jennifer, and Mike White was the trophy engraving station. Among the partygoers were Jenna Ortega, Salma Hayek, Evan Peters, Jeremy Allen White, Donald Glover, Tyler James Williams, Seth Rogen (who rocked throughout the night in a powder pink suit by Dior), and Seth’s wife Lauren Miller. To cap my coverage of the 80th Globes, the return of the live show meant I got to see Christian Moralde again, having the coolest job of the night – getting the stars to the stage. The Filipino American actor, who also works as a talent flow coordinator, passed by my table several times, with stars, including Hilary Swank (pregnant with twins with her husband, Philip Schneider) and Ana de Armas, following behind him to take their turns as presenters onstage. The Arizona-raised Christian, dapper in a jacket by Crown Chic Vintage Clothing, said about working on the first awards show of the year and of the awards season – in person again after the pandemic era when most of the shows were virtual or hybrid virtual and partially in person: “It was great to be back – kind of like coming home to normalcy and familiarity.” Christian, who works in most of the top awards and live shows in Hollywood, enthused about the Globes, which is often described as Hollywood’s party of the year. “I’ve always loved the Globes,” he stressed. “What people see during the broadcast, the party-like atmosphere, is actually how it feels in the ballroom. It feels more celebration than a ceremony. The Globes have an infectious energy that is all-inclusive and exclusive.” Also an event host and a philanthropist, Christian said about the hurdles of working in the top shows: “It’s all the challenges that come with a live show. We have to be on top of every detail to ensure every target in terms of time is met, and there’s no room for error.” “Every person, be it presenter or nominee, has to be exactly where they need to be when they’re needed. But to my previous point, to do it in such a way as not to disrupt the levity or atmosphere of the event.” I asked how he manages to keep smiling and relaxed when I see him working in these fast-paced, pressure-packed live shows: “That is a thoughtful sentiment, thank you. I feel that it has always been a privilege to be at the show. The fact that I am there versus countless others who want to be is an honor that is never lost on me.” Christian, who wears many hats, revealed some of the stars and talents he enjoys working with. “There are so many – Jessica Chastain, Henry Winkler, and Hilary Swank are always great.” “Jennifer Coolidge is another one. I’ve known her for quite some time – we met in 2006. I had a one-on-one interview with her for her film For Your Consideration for a network I was doing on-camera work for at the time.” On three of his most memorable work experiences, Christian answered, “There are truly so many. One memorable experience occurred years ago when I played double duty at the Emmy Awards. I started off interviewing nominees and presenters for the pre-show and jumped right into my talent position for the actual show.” “Other unforgettable experiences include watching the monitor at the 2017 Oscars with Jamie Dornan with complete disbelief in the La La Land and Moonlight mix-up. I had the same sort of disbelief at last year’s Oscars with ‘the slap.’” As if the Globes night was not heady enough, the following evening, January 11, Filipino and Asian creatives attended an “Evening of Gladness” for Dolly. In the pool area of the beautiful home of multiple Emmy Award-winning producers Peter Brennan and Lisa Manibog Lew Brennan (former Miss Philippines International), actor CJ Uy led a serenade of “Hello Dolly” to a beaming Dolly. Vincent Nebrida cleverly tweaked the classic song’s lyrics to salute the honoree. Janet and I had the honor of introducing Dolly whom we first met at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, where it all began for her. Organized in just a short time by Lisa and Cindy Sison, LA-based head of international sales and acquisitions of TBA Studios (which released Triangle of Sadness in the Philippines), the bash celebrating the trailblazing Filipina actress drew a great mix of talents and executives, including Reggie Lee, the Basco brothers (Dante, Dion, and Darion), Kamran Lucas (Cindy’s talented actor son), Bryan Geli, Marie Jamora, Quark Henares (who told us he was on the same LA-bound flight with Dolly), Ben Bulatao, David Tupaz, and Joey Galon. Other guests who toasted Dolly included: Amazon Originals’ Erika North and Raphael Phang, dick clark productions’ Melissa Bella Montemagni (yes, we need more Filipino Americans in key positions in Hollywood), Winston Emano, Redband Media’s Mark Bella, Yong Chavez, Dino Thee Ray Ramos, Inside Edition’s Fil-Am correspondent Victoria Recaño, Netflix’s David Ninh, Michele Josue, Faith Santilla, Anna Liza Recto, Jennifer Peat, and Extra TV’s Theresa Coffino. More Hollywood figures graced the occasion: Andy Cheng, James Lew, Philip Rhee, Sean Rhee, and Peter Kwong. Our daughter, Lionsgate’s Bianca Nicole Nepales Gervacio, came with her cousin and Janet’s nephew, actor John Medina. The sprawling home above Sunset Boulevard, formerly owned by Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash, pulsated with music by DJ Don Requejo, and offered delicious food whipped up by chef Victor Cardet with Daniel Dickerman and Gabriel Avenna, and featured a bar manned by Brandon Polley. An entire table groaned with sweets by Philip DeBevoise’s Dolci Fine Desserts, including a photo cake bearing Dolly’s face. As a result, Dolly, Adam Kersh, and Jennifer Beaton (her manager and agent, respectively), stayed much longer even though they had another event to grace. Dolly capped her busy week in LA with two more events, both on one day, Saturday, January 14. The first stop was the Four Seasons Hotel tea party by the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA), which included Dolly in its longlist for best supporting actress (the nominations will be announced on January 19). Among the guests were Till actress Danielle Deadwyler (both she and Dolly, buzzed for Oscar nominations, posed for a photo), Michelle Yeoh, Janelle Monae, Angela Bassett, Ke Huy Quan, and Guillermo del Toro. Dolly, who gets many Hollywood talents excited when they see her (that’s the power of her performance in Ruben Ostlund’s film), proceeded next to the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (LAFCA) Awards which previously announced her and Ke as best supporting performance winners. In her acceptance speech at the ceremonies held at The Biltmore Hotel, Dolly said, “I’ve been acting for 33 years and often played nameless characters, and sometimes lineless characters. I’ve thought of quitting so many times. But that’s changed, thanks to you, LAFCA.” Dolly’s photo with Cate Blanchett (another actress garnering Academy frontrunner buzz), who received the best lead performance certificate for Tar, is everything. In their first meeting, the two actresses amusingly posed beside an “out of order” sign in the ladies’ room. Dolly has more busy weeks ahead. In March, she will play Jason Schwartzman’s not-so-nice stepmom in a comedy by director Nathan Silver. I heard other exciting details about this project and others but for now, my lips are sealed. At the rate things are shaping up, it will be a year of gladness for Dolly. – Rappler.com"

The Series A funding round also saw participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital India and Southeast Asia’s Surge, Febe Ventures, Antler, Foxmont, and Kaya Founders, as well as new investors Access Ventures and JG Digital Equity Ventures. Locad chief executive officer and co-founder Constantin Robertz said the funding would be used for its network expansion in the Philippines and across Asia-Pacific, as well as product development. It is looking at adding warehouses, partnering with transport operators, and hiring talent to scale in Southeast Asia and Australia. “In the Philippines, we already have fulfillment centers in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Over the next five years, we expect to build the region’s largest network of warehouses enabling next-day delivery in Tier 1 to 3 cities across the region, and make this available to brands and merchants in one integrated platform,” Robertz said. In July 2021, Locad was able to secure $4.9 million in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital India. Launched in 2020, Locad synchronizes inventory and delivery services across channels like Shopify, Lazada, Shopee, and TikTok Shop. Locad said it has a 99% same-day order fulfillment rate. The Philippine-born startup has served 200 brands across the Philippines and Asia-Pacific, and has so far completed 2 million transactions. Robertz declined to answer questions on valuation, but noted that e-commerce is growing at a healthy pace from a plateau. “Despite the markets reopening, which is a good thing, we still see robust demand in e-commerce in the Philippines and Southeast Asia and don’t see the market shrinking. It is a healthy level of growth coming from a large base,” he said. – Rappler.com"

Tyrese Maxey scored 16 points as the 76ers defeated the Utah Jazz and Lakers on consecutive nights. The Sixers won for the seventh time in their past nine games. LeBron James scored 35 points with 10 assists for the Lakers, while reaching the 38,000-point mark for his career on a first-quarter basket. James is one of just two players to reach the scoring plateau as he closes in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA record 38,387 points. Russell Westbrook scored 20 points with 14 rebounds and 11 assists for the Lakers in his fourth triple-double of the season. Los Angeles lost its third consecutive game but has been far more competitive while going 5-3 since December 30.

The Lakers’ Dennis Schroder made a driving layup for a 109-108 lead with 1:42 remaining, before Georges Niang’s 3-pointer with 1:27 on the clock put the Sixers up 111-109. A Lakers turnover led to Embiid’s basket from just inside the free-throw line for a 113-109 Philadelphia advantage. Los Angeles pulled within a point on a 3-pointer from Troy Brown Jr. with 37 seconds left and got the ball back after an Embiid miss. But they were unable to win in the closing seconds as Westbrook lost the handle on a go-ahead layup bid at the buzzer. Tobias Harris scored 15 points for the Sixers. Wenyen Gabriel scored 14 points for the Lakers, while Brown added 13 and Thomas Bryant had 10. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/benjamin-magalong-message-smni-apollo-quiboloy-hosts-no-one-above-law/,[],"VIGAN CITY — Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong warned the leader and hosts of Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) on Monday, January 16, that they could face accountability for their constant practice of vilifying individuals. In a statement released to media, Magalong admonished Apollo Quiboloy, leader of the religious sect Kingdom of Jesus Christ and owner of SMNI, former presidential communications office official Lorraine Badoy, and surrenderer Jeffrey Celis for accusing him of treason and conspiring with communist rebels. “This tirade against me is unfounded and baseless, and has subjected my person to needless and undeserved condemnation,” the mayor said. “In relation to the above-mentioned personalities who have acquired the habit of incessantly defaming people without an iota of evidence, be reminded that NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,” Magalong added. Magalong first earned the ire of the SMNI personalities in 2021, with his order to remove tarps and other materials tagging people’s organizations and youth groups as terrorists. Quiboloy resurrected the attacks a statement in his program Spotlight, which SMNI uploaded on January 14. Badoy and Celis accused Magalong in their program Laban ng Bayan on January 9 and January 13. They also accused the mayor of ordering the removal of posters declaring the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) as persona non grata in the city. However, Magalong’s order only covered materials that vilify cause-oriented groups and activists in the city. In June 2020, Magalong affirmed the resolution passed by the city council in January 2020, declaring communist rebels unwanted in the city. Under his chairmanship, the Regional Peace and Order Council (RPOC) endorsed Dumanon, Makitongtong (visit and talk), a program patterned from Tokhang, targeting individuals suspected of having links with communist rebels. Magalong has not recently made statements on human rights or against red-tagging. He has been in the news for agreeing to join the panel evaluating high-ranking officials for links to drug cartels. Magalong said his service record as an officer of the Philippine Constabulary and the Philippine National Police speaks for his truthful service to the country. The mayor recalled that he had been fighting communist guerrillas in Luzon and Mindanao since graduating from the Philippine Military Academy in 1982. His first assignment was in Abra, one of the country’s rebel strongholds in the 1980s, where he was wounded in combat. “From that year to 2005, I staked my life fighting the CPP/NPA, leading my men not from the rear but up front in numerous operations,” he said. “To be accused that I have turned my back on my lifelong commitment against the CPP/NPA is a grave insult that sweeps aside my lengthy and loyal service to the Philippines,” Magalong stated. Citing his stint in the RPOC and vice chair of the Regional Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, Magalong said the “program continues to succeed in the Cordillera, notably with stronger support from the local communities and better perception from the public.” Protecting Baguio youth As the local chief executive of Baguio, Magalong said his loyalty to the Philippine government remains “unflinching.” “I am safeguarding our young constituents from being subjected to unnecessary vilification by striving to ensure that our youth activists – not communists – in Baguio are safe from persecution and harassment,” he said. “Youthful activism does not necessarily mean espousing a communist ideology,” the mayor added. The mayor was also the subject of Badoy’s ire in March 2022 following his dialogue with cause-oriented groups in the city. During the meeting, the mayor reassured the safety of activists in the city and ordered the removal of posters red-tagging groups and individuals. “If my actions as head of a local government are under question, let the due process be sternly observed. By all means, take the necessary steps that I be sanctioned, in accordance with procedures in place, without having to be publicly scorned over a non-issue,” Magalong said. – Rappler.com"

Johnmar “OhMyV33nus” Villaluna said the best is yet to come for Blacklist International as it missed out on history after losing to Echo in an all-Filipino finale for the Mobile Legends M4 World Championship on Sunday, January 15. On the verge of becoming Mobile Legends’ first back-to-back world champions, Blacklist International suffered a stunning 4-0 sweep in the best-of-seven duel. “I will make sure that we will come back stronger than ever,” OhMyV33nus wrote on Facebook. “This is still not the last of us.” All signs pointed to Blacklist International lifting the M4 crown after it repeatedly beat Echo in the local and international scenes. Blacklist International thwarted Echo for the Season 10 title in the Mobile Legends Professional League (MPL) Philippines in October. When they met again in the upper bracket finals of M4, Blacklist completed a come-from-behind 3-2 win to advance to the grand finals and relegate Echo to the lower bracket. Echo, however, pushed all the right buttons in the grand finals – including banning OhMyV33nus’ signature hero Estes in all four games – to shock the former world champions. “All of this feels familiar to me,” said OhMyV33nus in Filipino. “I want to cry but no tears would come out. Maybe because we’ve been at this point too many times that I already feel numb.” OhMyV33nus, though, said she draws strength from the team’s supporters as Blacklist International plots its next move, seeking to win a fourth MPL Philippines championship in Season 11 starting in February. “I’m super thankful to all the people who continue to believe in us,” OhMyV33nus said. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/editorials/ferdinand-marcos-jr-world-economic-forum-davos-switzerland-delegation/,[],"Davos sa Switzerland – may shared history ang lugar na ito kay Presidente Ferdinand Marcos Jr., at hindi ito puwedeng kalimutan, kahit sabihin ng isang foreign affairs undersecretary na, “I don’t think it’s an issue.” Ang Switzerland ang pinaglagakan ng bilyon-bilyong ill-gotten wealth ng mga Marcos noong panahon ng Martial Law. Imagine, tatapak si Marcos sa bansang nag-ingat ng tagong yaman ng kanyang pamilya, at tatapak siya doon bilang head of state. Truth is stranger than fiction nga naman. Pero hindi ito tungkol sa treasure hunt. Ito’y tungkol sa pagpunta ni Marcos sa Davos upang umattend ng World Economic Forum (WEF). Maraming usaping mas mahalaga sa kagyat. Una, bakit ayon sa report ng Vera Files, nasa 70 ang bilang ng Philippine delegation? Aba’y talong-talo talaga natin ang Estados Unidos na may 19 na miyembrong ipinadala at wala si President Joe Biden; ang India na nagpadala ng pitong tao at hindi rin kasama si Prime Minister Narendra Modi; ang Finland na tatlong ministro lang ang ipadadala kahit kasama ang prime minister nila na si Sann Marin. Kung babalikan din natin ang kasaysayan ng pagpapadala ng Pilipinas sa Davos, nagpunta si dating pangulong Benigno Aquino III na may karay na pitong tao noong 2013. At ayon sa isang kasama sa biyahe, nag-renta sila ng maliit na bahay, nag-share ng kuwarto at banyo, at nagluto ng sariling almusal. (Walang datos kung ilan ang kasama ni Gloria Arroyo sa Davos.) At eto pa, kasama sa 70 ang showbiz stars na mag-e-entertain sa mga Pilipino sa Switzerland. Sabi naman ng resident economist ng Rappler na si JC Punongbayan, medyo dyahe kapag tinanong si Marcos sa Davos kung ano ang ginagawa niya upang labanan ang inflation and cost of living crisis. Umabot ng 8.1% ang inflation nitong Disyembre at may shortage sa pangunahing mga bilihin tulad ng sibuyas at itlog. Context: patok na issue sa WEF ang cost of living issue dahil na nga sa recession. Ano raw ang fundamentals na puwede nating ipagmalaki na magbibigay-katuwiran sa Maharlika Investment Fund na balak ni Marcos ilako sa Davos? Ang sovereign wealth fund ay isang diskarte ng mga bansang may excess wealth. Ini-invest ang disposable wealth upang mapalago ito. Pero lumagpas ang gastos ng gobyerno sa  P1.23 trilyon mula Enero hanggang Nobyembre 2022; umabot nga ang utang ng Pilipinas sa P13.64 trilyon nitong Nobyembre, at ang debt-to-GDP ratio na 63.7% ang pinakamataas sa loob ng labimpitong taon. Anong larawan ang nabubuo sa klase ng pamumuno ni Marcos sa Davos trip na ito? Ang daming problema sa bansa. Naging simbolo na ang sibuyas ng incompetence at cluelessness ng administrasyong ito sa larangan ng ekonomiya. Mismong mga stewardess na dati’y designer goods ang iniuuwi, nagbibitbit na ng sibuyas. Last time we checked, inihalal ng taumbayan si Marcos na presidente, hindi ambassador-at-large. Lahat ng acoustics ng Davos trip, sintunado. Talaga bang wala lang, makadalo lang? – Rappler.com"

Anne, who made history in October 2022 as the first transgender woman to acquire the organization in its 70-year history, spoke before pageant fans to share what it means to have a woman take the reins of the prestigious franchise. “It has been 70 years since the Miss Universe Organization was run by men. Now, the time is up. It is the moment for women to take the lead,” she said. “From now on it’s gonna be run by women, owned by a transwoman, for all women around the world.” Calling it a “new era of the global women’s empowerment platform,” Anne emphasized that the pageant will “celebrate the power of feminism, diverse cultures, social inclusion, gender equality, creativity, a force for good, and the beauty of humanity.” The Miss Universe owner went on to describe her own experiences as a transgender woman and how it influenced her to achieve her dreams. “When I was born as a trans woman, I got bullied and sexually harassed by my own teacher when I was young. Plus, I was not accepted by society because they did not want to embrace my differences,” she recalled. “But guess what? I chose not to surrender. I turned pain into power. And I turned life lessons into wisdom.” This sense of empowerment, she shared, is what she hoped the delegates would feel in the Miss Universe stage: “We can elevate our women to feel strong enough, good enough, qualified enough, and never be objectified again.” The 71st edition of the pageant – the first under Anne – saw several changes in the competition including the use of sustainable sash, addition of capes in the swimsuit segment, and putting a spotlight on the candidates’ advocacies through their VTRs. R’Bonney Gabriel of USA won the crown. The 2023 pageant will also see aspiring beauty queens of any civil status as Paula Shugart, president of the Miss Universe organization, confirmed in September 2022 that the 72nd edition of the pageant will now allow moms and wives to participate in the competition. – Rappler.com"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-covid-19-updates-january-16-2023/,[],"BEIJING, China – Luggage-laden passengers flocked to railway stations and airports in China’s megacities on Monday, January 16, heading home for holidays that health experts fear could intensify a COVID-19 outbreak that has claimed thousands of lives. After three years of strict and suffocating anti-virus controls, China in early December abruptly abandoned its “zero COVID” policy, letting the virus run freely through its 1.4 billion population. Authorities on Saturday said nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospitals between Dec. 8 and Jan. 12, a huge increase from previous figures that had been criticized by the World Health Organization for not reflecting the scale and severity of the outbreak. Even those numbers most likely exclude many people dying at home, especially in rural areas with weaker medical systems, one health expert has said. Several experts forecast more than one million people in China will die from the disease this year. Ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, also known as the Spring Festival, which officially starts on January 21, state media has been filled with stories of rural hospitals and clinics bolstering their supplies of drugs and equipment. “The peak of COVID infection in our village has passed, but the Spring Festival is approaching and there are still left-behind villagers, especially the elderly, at risk of secondary infection,” a doctor in Shaanxi province said in an article by regional news outlet Red Star News. “If the anti-viral and other drugs were more abundant, I would be more confident,” the doctor added. As well as fever drugs and oxygen supplies, China’s National Health Commission has said it would equip every village clinic with pulse oximeters, fingertip devices commonly used during the pandemic to quickly check oxygen levels. Beijing’s main rail station has been packed with passengers leaving the capital in recent days, according to Reuters witnesses. In China’s most populous city, Shanghai, temporary night trains have been added to meet demand for travelers heading to the eastern Anhui Province, China’s official state news agency Xinhua reported. Meanwhile, daily arrivals in the gambling hub of Macau exceeded 55,000 on Saturday, the highest daily arrivals since the pandemic began. In Hong Kong, the government has said it would increase the number of people who can pass through designated land border control points to the mainland to 65,000 people per day from 50,000 between Jan. 18 and Jan. 21. China’s transport ministry has said it expects more than 2 billion trips in the weeks around the holidays. The revival of travel in China has lifted expectations of a rebound in the world’s second-largest economy, which is suffering its lowest growth rates in nearly half a century. Those hopes helped lift Asian equity markets on Monday, adding to gains of 4.2% last week. China’s blue-chip index was up 0.6% on Monday, while global oil prices have also been supported on expectations of a recovery in demand from the world’s top importer China. Chinese data on economic growth, retail sales and industrial output due this week are certain to be dismal, but markets will likely look past that to how China’s reopening could bolster global growth, analysts say. – Rappler.com"

Mann scored 31 points, Leonard tallied 30, and both had six rebounds and four assists. They combined to shoot 24-for-40 from the field, including 8 of 13 from behind the arc, as the Clippers, who outscored Houston 30-10 in the fourth quarter, snapped a stretch of seven losses in eight games. The Rockets suffered their 10th consecutive loss. Eric Gordon led Houston with 24 points while KJ Martin added 22 — with seven dunks — and nine rebounds. Alperen Sengun had 15 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Rockets, who led by as many as eight before collapsing late. Houston was without Kevin Porter Jr. (foot injury) and Jalen Green and Jae’Sean Tate (suspensions). The Clippers took control early in the fourth quarter, responding to Tari Eason’s basket that tied the score at 92-92 with an 11-0 run keyed by a Robert Covington 3-pointer with 10:04 left. Norman Powell (18 points), Covington, Reggie Jackson and Moses Brown scored in the paint over the ensuing two minutes as the Clippers took their first double-digit lead, one they did not give up. The spirited third quarter featured nine lead changes and three ties. Leonard tallied 12 points in the back-and-forth period, and the Clippers benefited from six Houston turnovers that yielded seven points. The Rockets led by as many as eight points in the frame, but the Clippers led 91-90 after the quarter and seized control with their burst to open the final period. Martin produced four dunks in the opening period for the Rockets, but it was Sengun’s push shot that gave Houston a 27-19 lead. Leonard replied with nine consecutive points for the Clippers, including three mid-range jumpers and a 3-pointer. When Covington nailed a 3 late in the first, the Clippers grabbed a 31-30 lead entering the second on the back of a 12-3 closing run. The Clippers’ 3-point shooting kept them in the fray. Mann and Nicolas Batum sandwiched 3s around a trey from Sengun that helped Houston maintain a 45-42 lead. The Clippers pulled the same trick to close the half, as Powell and Mann buried 3s around another Martin dunk, with Mann beating the buzzer with a 49-footer that cut the Houston lead to 63-62 at intermission.

Vucevic hit 18 of his 31 shots and half his 10 3-point attempts, giving him 14 more points than he’d scored in any previous game this season. The 43 points matched the total he had against the Bulls as a member of the Orlando Magic in February 2021. Vucevic has scored 20 or more points in seven of his last 11 games against the Warriors, with three games of 30 or more and now one of 40 or more.

Klay Thompson bombed in eight 3-pointers in 15, accounting for all but two of his team-high 26 points for the Warriors, who fell to 4-17 on the road. Stephen Curry put up a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double for Golden State, while Jordan Poole had 15 points, Anthony Lamb 14 and Andrew Wiggins 11. Coming off a 144-113 romp at San Antonio before an NBA-record crowd at the Alamodome, the Warriors rallied from a 35-20 deficit after one quarter into a 62-59 halftime lead on the strength of a 42-point second period. But the Bulls, seeking to snap a three-game losing streak, regained their early form in the second half, grabbing the lead for good on Patrick Williams’ free throw just before the midpoint of the third period. Chicago went on to lead by six at period’s end, then quickly grabbed command in the final quarter behind a pair of Vucevic’s 3-pointers, the second of which put Golden State in a 106-91 hole. Zach LaVine backed Vucevic with 27 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Bulls. Coby White chipped in with 15 points, Ayo Dosunmu with 12 and Williams with 10.

https://www.rappler.com/voices/new-school/opinion-taiwanese-youth-perspective-return-marcos-philippines/,[],"White terror, suppression of media and free speech, thousands killed, tens of thousands more imprisoned and tortured, disappearances of people who dare to speak out against the government, and an iron-fist dictator. It sounds like the late dictator Marcos Sr.’s 20-year rule of the Philippines, but it actually also describes the period of martial law in Taiwan that lasted from 1949 to 1987 under generalissimo Chang Kai Shek. Unlike the Philippines, however, Taiwan has worked tirelessly on “transitional justice” — ensuring the memory of Martial Law is ingrained in school textbooks and erecting memorials and museums about human rights advocates then. Furthermore, unlike the Marcoses, the Kuomintang (party of Chiang Kai Shek) has apologized for their state terror then and does not praise their own martial law or dictator. Taiwan offers the Filipino people a lot of great examples on how to confront our dark history and ensure it is never forgotten, as well as compensating the victims of Martial Law. Additionally, we too perhaps offer Taiwan a warning unto what happens when a vast majority of the population forgets their history and do not stand vigilant against fake news and misinformation. The following is a reflection of my friend, Jasmine Wu, unto our International Law of Human Rights project for National Chengchi University’s International College of Innovation. For two years now, we have been representing Karapatan, the largest human rights alliance NGO in the Philippines, at the Taiwan Human Rights Table (人權辦桌) held every December by the Dr. Chen Wen-chen Memorial Foundation and Museum (陳文成博士紀念基金會). Here, not only do NGOs from various advocacies promote their causes, but they also let people of all ages dine with survivors of Taiwan’s Martial Law period in an effort to promote dialogue between the young and old generations. This year, my Filipino friend, Gino, planned our booth’s content to show the shared history of martial law in the Philippines and in Taiwan, so that we can stand in solidarity and learn lessons from both countries. When I was learning about the history and how our governments deal with this past, I realized that our emotions or thoughts towards history can be easily shaped by the ruler, by how they want us to think, no matter if it’s Marcos Jr.’s way of trying to shape a positive narrative of his father’s era, or Tsai Ing-Wen’s emphasis on shedding more light towards the injustices of White Terror. Therefore, it is very vital to question everything, read more, and see in different perspectives, so that we will not be susceptible to being manipulated by the information presented in our eyes. During the interactions with people who came to the booth, when we talked about the dictator’s son (Marcos Jr.) being the leader in the Philippines, I met several Taiwanese who mentioned Chiang Wan-an, thinking that Taiwan is heading towards the same situation as the Philippines. Chiang Wan-an is the alleged grandnephew of former dictator Chiang Kai Shek. There are still differences between us, however the similarities are still worth thinking about. It made me ponder the question, “Can one accept a leader who is from a former dictator’s family?” To be honest, at first, when Gino told us about the content that we were putting in the booth this year, I was wondering why we had to let people know about Martial Law again. Wasn’t it a bit cliché and overly mentioned in Taiwan? But the more I learned about how similar governments have been under martial law, and how differently our current government is dealing with that past, it made me realize that I was wrong. I finally realized, to be reminded of those haunting tragic incidents again and again isn’t meant to fill our mind with hatred. Instead, it is to place fear: A fear of history repeating again. A fear of the truth being twisted. A fear of the stories of innocent victims being denied and forgotten. A fear of losing fear. Fear is often viewed as a negative emotion for progression; however, fear shows what we have to do. Fear shows that we are paying attention and acknowledging the severity of the consequences if we didn’t fear. Because, to paraphrase the words of Zig Ziglar, fear means: Face Everything And Rise. – Rappler.com Jasmine Wu is an undergraduate student at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University (NCCU).
